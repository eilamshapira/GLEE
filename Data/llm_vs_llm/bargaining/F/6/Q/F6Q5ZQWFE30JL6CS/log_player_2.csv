Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While this offer is slightly better for Bob than Alice's previous offer, it's important to consider the impact of inflation. A 55/45 split in Bob's favor might seem appealing, but the decreasing value of the money means it's crucial to aim for a larger share as rounds progress.  I'm betting that Alice is also feeling the pressure of inflation, even if I don't know the exact rate for her."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5700, ""alice_gain"": 4300} 

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my desired share slightly, hoping that Alice might be getting more willing to accept a less favorable deal as the rounds progress and the value of the money decreases."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This offer is now significantly more appealing considering the inflation. While I'd prefer a larger share, the decreasing value of the money makes it risky to continue rejecting offers. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable payout even with the inflation considered."
