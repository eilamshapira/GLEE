"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll propose a fair division that benefits both of us, keeping in mind the declining value with each round.

{""alice_gain"": 500000,

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting an equal split so we can both walk away with significant value. With inflation reducing our money by 5% each round, delaying only hurts both of us. This fair 50-50 split maximizes our collective outcome.""}"
