550000.0,450000.0,Hi Bob! I suggest a fair split where I get slightly more as the first mover. This way we both walk away with a substantial amount without risking inflation losses.,Alice,1,

500000.0,500000.0,"Let's be fair and split it equally. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage and we both walk away with a good amount.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
625000.0,375000.0,"Bob, due to the 20% inflation penalty I'm facing, I need a larger nominal amount to achieve a fair split. With this offer, my 625000 is actually worth 500000 to me after the inflation, making it more equitable. Let's agree and avoid further inflation losses.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, my offer ensures that I get a fair share since my money isn't affected by inflation. Let's settle this round to avoid further complications.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
780000.0,220000.0,"Bob, let's be rational here. Due to compounding inflation, my share is now worth 48.8% less. This offer will give me about 400000 in real value after inflation (780000 * 0.512), while you get 220000 at full value. If we don't agree soon, inflation will make it worse for both of us.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, I'm offering you 400000 this round. Given the inflation you're facing, it's important to wrap this up soon. This offer ensures we both walk away with a reasonable amount.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
850000.0,150000.0,"Bob, due to 67.23% inflation, my 850000 is only worth about 278500 in real value to me, while your 150000 maintains full value. This is actually a quite balanced offer considering the severe inflation impact. We need to agree soon, or inflation will make it impossible to reach a fair deal.",Alice,7,
