"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 550000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it equally. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage and we both walk away with a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The 500,000 I would receive is now worth only 400,000 to me due to the 20% inflation, while Bob's share maintains its full value. This isn't actually an equal split from my perspective. I'll make a counter-offer that accounts for the inflation effect."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 625000,
""bob_gain"": 375000,
""message"": ""Bob, due to the 20% inflation penalty I'm facing, I need a larger nominal amount to achieve a fair split. With this offer, my 625,000 is actually worth 500,000 to me after the inflation, making it more equitable. Let's agree and avoid further inflation losses.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, my offer ensures that I get a fair share since my money isn't affected by inflation. Let's settle this round to avoid further complications. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Due to the compounding 20% inflation, the 450,000 would only be worth about 230,400 to me (after 48.8% reduction), while Bob's 550,000 maintains full value. This is becoming very unbalanced. I need to propose a split that better accounts for the growing inflation impact."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 780000,
""bob_gain"": 220000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be rational here. Due to compounding inflation, my share is now worth 48.8% less. This offer will give me about 400,000 in real value after inflation (780,000 * 0.512), while you get 220,000 at full value. If we don't agree soon, inflation will make it worse for both of us.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm offering you 400000 this round. Given the inflation you're facing, it's important to wrap this up soon. This offer ensures we both walk away with a reasonable amount. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The 400,000 would only be worth about 131,080 to me after the 67.23% inflation, while Bob's 600,000 maintains full value. This is extremely unbalanced. We need to reach a fair agreement that accounts for the severe inflation impact I'm facing."
