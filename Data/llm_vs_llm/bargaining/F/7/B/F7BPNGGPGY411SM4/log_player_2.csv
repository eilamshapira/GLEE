"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a simple 50-50 split which is fair to both of us. This way we can both walk away with a good amount and not risk losing value in later rounds. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:
1. The offer is a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
2. However, with each round, my share loses 20% value
3. If I reject now, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
4. But my counter-offer would need to be compelling enough for Alice to accept
5. My $5000 now is worth more than $5000 in future rounds
6. There's also the risk of going through all 12 rounds and getting nothing

Given this is the first round and the offer is fair, accepting now guarantees me $5000 at full value rather than risking depreciation or total loss.
