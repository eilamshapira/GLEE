"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I need to consider the ticking clock and the inflation that affects only me. I'll start with a relatively generous offer, hoping Bob accepts it quickly.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the inflation. My gain from round 1 would be worth 6000, but now 4500 is on the table. However, if I reject, the next round will have even worse inflation. I need to calculate the effective value of 4500 with 10% inflation. 4500 * 0.9 = 4050. Let's compare with previous round's offer: 6000 * 0.9 = 5400. It is a considerable difference.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Alright, the inflation is hurting. I'll try to offer something that's still appealing to Bob, but slightly more in my favor considering the circumstances. Remember my money's worth 10% less for *each* round now, so this round it's worth 20% less overall (10% less than round 2, cumulative). I need to be careful.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500
}
