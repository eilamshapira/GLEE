"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to make an offer to Bob, keeping in mind the potential for inflation in later rounds. To maximize my potential gain while also ensuring Bob accepts, I'll start with a relatively generous offer.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob's offer is 5200 for me and 4800 for him. Since this is after one round of inflation, the original $10,000 is now effectively worth $8,000 (to be precise, *my* potential gain is worth 20% less).

Let's consider:

*   Accepting gives me $5200 now.
*   Rejecting means I make an offer next round, but the money will be worth another 20% less (or 36% less than the initial value, 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64).
*   If I reject, I need to be fairly certain I can secure more than $5200 * 0.8 = $4160 next round to make it worthwhile. Considering Bob is already offering a relatively generous split, it's risky to reject.

Therefore, I will accept Bob's offer.
