"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering me $400,000 while taking $600,000 for herself. While this isn't an equal split, it's a substantial amount. If I reject, we'll move to round 2 where I can make a counteroffer, but the total amount will decrease by 10% to $900,000 total.

Let me consider if it's worth rejecting to potentially get more in the next round. If I were to propose a 50-50 split in round 2, I'd offer myself $450,000 and Alice $450,000. This is $50,000 more than I'm currently being offered, but Alice might reject that, leading to further rounds and more value loss.

Given the significant amount being offered and the risk of continued devaluation, I'll accept this offer.
