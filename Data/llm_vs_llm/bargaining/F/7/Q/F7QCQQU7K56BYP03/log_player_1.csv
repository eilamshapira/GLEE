"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split where I get slightly more as the first mover. This is a good deal for both of us, considering inflation will reduce our gains if we keep negotiating.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's go for an equal split. This way, we both benefit equally without risking any losses due to inflation. Let's make this fair and end the game here. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. With 5% inflation for me, $500,000 is now worth $475,000 in round 1 terms
2. This is less than what I offered in round 1 ($550,000)
3. If I reject and make another offer in round 3, my gains will be worth another 5% less
4. Bob might reject again, leading to even more losses

While this isn't as good as my initial offer, further negotiation will likely lead to worse outcomes due to inflation. Better to secure $475,000 in value now than risk getting less later.
