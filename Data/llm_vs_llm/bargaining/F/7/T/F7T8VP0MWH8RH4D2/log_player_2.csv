"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Let's see if Alice can do better in the next round. Since the value of the money decreases for me with each round, I want to see if Alice will offer more to avoid prolonging the game."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

With this offer, I'm aiming to get a larger share of the total amount while still giving Alice a reasonable portion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5250 
# Alice gain: 4750 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Even though the money is worth 19% less than in the first round, accepting this offer ensures that I get a reasonable amount of money. Prolonging the game further might lead to even greater losses due to inflation."
