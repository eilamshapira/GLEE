"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a reasonable first offer, considering that inflation will reduce the value by 20% each round if Bob declines.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This gives Bob a significant portion while still securing a good amount for myself. If Bob declines, we'll both face inflation in the next round, which could make us both worse off."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

If I accept Bob's 50-50 split now:
- My $5000 is worth 20% less due to inflation, so effectively $4000 for me
- Bob's $5000 is worth only 5% less, so it's worth $4750 for him

If I reject and make a new offer in round 3:
- The money will be worth even less (40% less for me)
- I'm not sure I can get a better deal that Bob would accept
- Further delays risk even more value loss

Given these factors, I should accept this offer. While not ideal, getting $4000 in effective value now is better than risking further devaluation.
