"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split of the money, considering the risk of declining offers due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

This is a fair 50-50 split. I believe this balanced offer gives us both a good outcome and avoids the risk of losing value through inflation in subsequent rounds."
