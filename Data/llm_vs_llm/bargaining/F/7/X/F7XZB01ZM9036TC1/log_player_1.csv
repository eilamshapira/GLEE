Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given our different inflation rates, this is a fair split that benefits us both. If we continue to next round, your share will be worth significantly less due to your 20% depreciation rate. Let's conclude this now. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
