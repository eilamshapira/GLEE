"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I believe this is a fair division considering my proposal. Let's finalize this. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $200,000 out of $1,000,000 (20% of the total)
2. If I reject:
   * I can make a counter-offer next round
   * However, the money will be worth 5% less to me
   * More importantly, it will be worth 20% less to Alice
   * This gives me negotiating leverage

The offer of 20% is too low, and given Alice's higher inflation rate (20% vs my 5%), I have a stronger negotiating position by waiting. I can make a more favorable counter-offer next round, and Alice will have more pressure to accept due to their higher depreciation rate.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a strategic offer:

The money is now worth:
- For me: 95% of original value
- For Alice: 80% of original value

Given Alice's higher depreciation rate, I should propose a more balanced split that she would be motivated to accept rather than risk another round of 20% depreciation.

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Given our different inflation rates, this is a fair split that benefits us both. If we continue to next round, your share will be worth significantly less due to your 20% depreciation rate. Let's conclude this now.""}"
