Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, if you reject this offer, you'll get to propose in round 3—but by then your share will be worth 20% less, effectively 64% of the original dollar value. With this proposal, you secure an effective 0.8×800000 = $640000 value, which matches your best alternative outcome. Let’s conclude this now and avoid further depreciation on your share. 
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
