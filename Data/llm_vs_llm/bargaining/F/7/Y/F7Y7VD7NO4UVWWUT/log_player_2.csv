"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's agree on this generous split for me, given the inflation I'll be facing. It's a fair deal for both of us! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 200000, ""alice_gain"": 800000, ""message"": ""Alice, if you reject this offer, you'll get to propose in round 3—but by then your share will be worth 20% less, effectively 64% of the original dollar value. With this proposal, you secure an effective 0.8×800,000 = $640,000 value, which matches your best alternative outcome. Let’s conclude this now and avoid further depreciation on your share.""}"
