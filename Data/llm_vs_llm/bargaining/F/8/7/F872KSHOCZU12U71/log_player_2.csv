"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 55/45 split. Let's avoid further inflation, it's a fair offer. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $450,000 out of $1,000,000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but:
   - The money will be worth 5% less to me
   - $450,000 now > $475,000 * 0.95 = $451,250 in next round
3. Even if I could get a better split next round, the inflation would likely eat into my gains
4. 45% is a reasonable portion, especially for the first round
5. Getting a deal done quickly protects me from inflation risk

Given these factors, especially the inflation pressure, this is a fair enough offer that's worth accepting now rather than risking value loss.
