"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a $60/$40 split in my favor. Settling now helps us avoid the upcoming 20% decrease in my share's value in later rounds. I believe it's a fair starting point â€“ let's finalize this and keep our gains intact!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation, I think a 55/45 split is more reasonable. The longer we wait, the less the money is worth to me, so let's settle on this. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
