"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40 in my favor. It's a fair start considering the inflation affects you more. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's offering me 40% of the million dollars, which is $400,000, while she gets $600,000.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, I'll be affected by 5% inflation, meaning the total value to me would be $950,000. My optimal counter-offer would need to account for this decrease in value.

Given that I'm already getting a substantial amount ($400,000) and the risk of further value reduction if negotiations continue, I'll accept this offer.
