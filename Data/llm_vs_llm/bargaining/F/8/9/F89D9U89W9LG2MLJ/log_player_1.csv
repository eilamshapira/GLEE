"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose an offer that takes into account that Bob's money loses 10% value each round while mine doesn't lose value. This gives me some negotiating leverage.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose I get $60 and Bob gets $40. This is a fair split considering that if Bob rejects, his share will be worth less in the next round due to the 10% inflation penalty he faces."
