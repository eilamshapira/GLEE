Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I understand you want to split fairly, but I'm feeling the pressure of inflation. How about a slightly better split for me this time?""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the need for a better deal on your end. Let's compromise with this offer; it's fairer for me under the inflation influence. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This offer is better than my previous offer to Alice, and further rejection risks even heavier losses for me due to inflation. Accepting ensures a reasonable gain even with the impact of inflation on my end."
