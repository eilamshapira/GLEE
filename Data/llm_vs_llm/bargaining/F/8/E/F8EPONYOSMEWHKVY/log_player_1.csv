"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair initial offer, considering that the money loses 5% value for me each round. I want to encourage acceptance early to avoid value loss.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose that I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000. This is a reasonable split that gives both of us a substantial amount, with a slight advantage to me as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. With 5% inflation, $500,000 is now worth $475,000 to me
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount I get will be worth another 5% less
3. This is a fair 50-50 split from Bob, showing willingness to negotiate
4. The risk of further rounds reducing value and potential deadlock makes accepting now attractive
