"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6897, ""bob_gain"": 3103, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here’s my proposal: I receive $6,897 and you get $3,103. This split reflects our differing discount rates—by accepting now, you secure what you’d otherwise get (discounted by 10%) if you had to wait for your turn to propose. Let’s avoid further loss in value and settle today!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the depreciation rates, but I believe a fairer split would be $4500 for me and $5500 for you. Let's make sure we both win in this deal and settle quickly. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
