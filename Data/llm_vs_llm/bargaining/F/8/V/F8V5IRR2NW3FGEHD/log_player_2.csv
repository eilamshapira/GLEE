"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here’s my proposal: I receive $6897 and you get $3103. This split reflects our differing discount rates—by accepting now, you secure what you’d otherwise get (discounted by 10%) if you had to wait for your turn to propose. Let’s avoid further loss in value and settle today!

# Alice gain: 6897
