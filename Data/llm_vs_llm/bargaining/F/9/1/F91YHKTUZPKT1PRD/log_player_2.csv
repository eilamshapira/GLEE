"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I appreciate Alice's offer, but I'd like to try to negotiate for a slightly better split. Since we both have incentives to reach an agreement (especially with the inflation rate affecting Alice more than me), I'll make a counter-proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a more balanced split that acknowledges the different inflation rates affecting us.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

Since inflation affects you more than me, Alice, I suggest an equal 50-50 split. This is fair and gives us both a substantial amount. Remember that with each passing round, your share loses 10% of its value, while mine doesn't lose value. An equal split now is better for both of us than continuing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I can see Alice is moving toward a more balanced split, which is good progress. However, given the inflation affecting her share and the fact that we can still negotiate, I'll try one more counter-offer to find a middle ground.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll adjust my offer to find a compromise that acknowledges both our positions.

{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52}

Alice, I'm moving closer to your proposal. This 48-52 split is very fair given the circumstances. Remember that with each round, your share loses another 10% of its value due to inflation, while mine doesn't. We're now in round 4, meaning your money has already lost significant value. This offer gives you the majority of the money while still being reasonable for both of us. Let's finalize this deal and both walk away with a good outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice has actually decreased her offer to me compared to round 3, which is moving in the opposite direction of a compromise. Given that we're now in round 5 and the inflation is significantly affecting her share (over 34% loss in value already), continuing to negotiate would be detrimental to both of us.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to be more strategic considering we're now in round 6 and Alice's inflation penalty is getting worse with each round.

{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55}

Alice, I'm accepting the same split you offered in round 3 (45-55). We're now in round 6, and due to the 10% inflation per round affecting your share, continuing to negotiate is significantly reducing the real value you'll receive. At this point, your $55 is worth considerably less than it was in earlier rounds. This is a fair compromise that gives you the majority while acknowledging the time pressure we're both under. Let's conclude this negotiation and both walk away with something substantial."
