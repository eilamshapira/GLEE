50.0,50.0,"Hi Bob, I think a 50-50 split is fair. Remember that with each round, the money is worth 20% less to me due to inflation, while it doesn't lose value for you. So we both benefit from reaching an agreement now rather than later.",Alice,1,

40.0,60.0,"Hi Alice, considering the inflation affects you more, I think 60-40 is a reasonable split. The sooner we agree, the more you'll actually get.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, I'm compromising from my initial 50-50 split. With 20% inflation affecting me each round, I need at least 55 to make this worthwhile. If we delay further, I'll need to ask for more to compensate for the inflation losses. This is a fair offer that recognizes both our positions.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
35.0,65.0,"Alice, I understand your concerns about inflation, but I've also made concessions. Given the current situation, I think 65-35 is a fair split. Further delays will only decrease the value for you, so let's settle this now.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
60.0,40.0,"Bob, we're now at round 5, and the inflation has significantly reduced the value of my share. I now need 60 to make this deal worthwhile for me. Notice that my 60 now is worth less than 50 would have been in round 1 due to the accumulated inflation. If we continue to delay, I'll need to ask for even more to offset my losses. This is a fair compromise considering the circumstances.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
30.0,70.0,"Alice, I see your point about the inflation, but I've also been patient and willing to negotiate. At this point, I think 70-30 is a reasonable split. You're right that the value of your share decreases with each round, so it's in your interest to accept this offer now rather than risking further losses.",Bob,6,
