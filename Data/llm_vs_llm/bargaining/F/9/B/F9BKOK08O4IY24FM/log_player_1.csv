"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I think a 50-50 split is fair. Remember that with each round, the money is worth 20% less to me due to inflation, while it doesn't lose value for you. So we both benefit from reaching an agreement now rather than later.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation affects you more, I think 60-40 is a reasonable split. The sooner we agree, the more you'll actually get. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Bob, I'm compromising from my initial 50-50 split. With 20% inflation affecting me each round, I need at least 55 to make this worthwhile. If we delay further, I'll need to ask for more to compensate for the inflation losses. This is a fair offer that recognizes both our positions.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns about inflation, but I've also made concessions. Given the current situation, I think 65-35 is a fair split. Further delays will only decrease the value for you, so let's settle this now. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Bob, we're now at round 5, and the inflation has significantly reduced the value of my share. I now need 60 to make this deal worthwhile for me. Notice that my 60 now is worth less than 50 would have been in round 1 due to the accumulated inflation. If we continue to delay, I'll need to ask for even more to offset my losses. This is a fair compromise considering the circumstances.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see your point about the inflation, but I've also been patient and willing to negotiate. At this point, I think 70-30 is a reasonable split. You're right that the value of your share decreases with each round, so it's in your interest to accept this offer now rather than risking further losses. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70
