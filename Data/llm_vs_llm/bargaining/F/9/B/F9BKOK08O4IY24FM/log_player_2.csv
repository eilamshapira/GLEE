"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I think a 50-50 split is fair. Remember that with each round, the money is worth 20% less to me due to inflation, while it doesn't lose value for you. So we both benefit from reaching an agreement now rather than later. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, 
""alice_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering the inflation affects you more, I think 60-40 is a reasonable split. The sooner we agree, the more you'll actually get.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm compromising from my initial 50-50 split. With 20% inflation affecting me each round, I need at least 55 to make this worthwhile. If we delay further, I'll need to ask for more to compensate for the inflation losses. This is a fair offer that recognizes both our positions. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 65, 
""alice_gain"": 35, 
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concerns about inflation, but I've also made concessions. Given the current situation, I think 65-35 is a fair split. Further delays will only decrease the value for you, so let's settle this now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're now at round 5, and the inflation has significantly reduced the value of my share. I now need 60 to make this deal worthwhile for me. Notice that my 60 now is worth less than 50 would have been in round 1 due to the accumulated inflation. If we continue to delay, I'll need to ask for even more to offset my losses. This is a fair compromise considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 70, 
""alice_gain"": 30, 
""message"": ""Alice, I see your point about the inflation, but I've also been patient and willing to negotiate. At this point, I think 70-30 is a reasonable split. You're right that the value of your share decreases with each round, so it's in your interest to accept this offer now rather than risking further losses.""}"
