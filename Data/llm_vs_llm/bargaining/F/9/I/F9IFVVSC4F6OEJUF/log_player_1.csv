"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a reasonable offer that gives a slight advantage to me but is still quite fair to Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. This is a fair split with a small premium for making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of an equal 50-50 split. This is a perfectly fair division of the money, and there's no guarantee I could get a better deal in later rounds. Both of us getting $5,000 is a reasonable outcome."
