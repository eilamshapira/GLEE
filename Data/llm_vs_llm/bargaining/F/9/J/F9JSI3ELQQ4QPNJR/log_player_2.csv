"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer:

- Alice is proposing I get $40 and she gets $60
- If I reject, I can make a counteroffer next round
- However, there's 10% inflation for me each round, so my $40 would become worth $36 next round
- I don't know how inflation affects Alice

Since this is the first round and my $40 will be worth less if I delay, and a 40/60 split isn't terrible, I'll accept the offer.
