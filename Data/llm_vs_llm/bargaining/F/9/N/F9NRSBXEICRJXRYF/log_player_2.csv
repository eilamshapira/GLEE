Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 
 
While not ideal, I need to push for a better split. Accepting this offer after three rounds would set a bad precedent and likely lead to even worse offers from Alice as the game progresses."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800} 

I'm lowering my ask slightly, but still aiming for a larger share recognizing the time pressure and inflation working against me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The inflation is becoming a serious concern, but accepting this offer sets a dangerous precedent and likely means I'll continue to get worse offers. I need to hold out hope that Alice will offer a fairer split soon."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  This is fair and straightforward.  Given the increasing inflation, it's important to settle on a deal soon."
