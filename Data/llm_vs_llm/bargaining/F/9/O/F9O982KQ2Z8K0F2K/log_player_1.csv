Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"":900000,""bob_gain"":100000,""message"":""I believe this division reflects my contribution, while still giving you a fair share.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given that time devalues your share more quickly than mine (10% vs 5%), this is a fair offer that gives you a solid majority while reflecting our relative negotiating positions. Further delays would reduce the value for both of us, but especially for you. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
