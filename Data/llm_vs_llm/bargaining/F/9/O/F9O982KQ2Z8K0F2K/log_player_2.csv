"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I believe this division reflects my contribution, while still giving you a fair share. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me 100,000$ out of 1,000,000$ (10% of the total). If I reject, we move to the next round where:
- My money will be worth 5% less
- Her money will be worth 10% less
- I get to make the next proposal

Given that Alice's money devalues faster than mine (10% vs 5%), I have leverage by rejecting and making a counter-offer in the next round. She'll be more pressured to accept a better deal for me since her share would be worth less with each rejection.

The current offer of 100,000$ is too low considering I have this negotiating advantage. I should reject and propose a more equitable split.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that money is now worth 5% less to me and 10% less to Alice, I should propose a more balanced split that Alice would be incentivized to accept, considering further delays would hurt her more than me.

{""bob_gain"": 400000,
