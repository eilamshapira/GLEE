"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think through this offer. Alice is proposing an equal split of $5,000 each. However, I need to consider that with each passing round, the money is worth 5% less to me due to inflation, while Alice faces no inflation penalty.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total $10,000 will effectively be worth only $9,500 to me (5% less). So even if I got the entire amount in the next round, it would be worth less than getting $5,000 now.

Since this is a fair 50-50 split and waiting would only decrease the value for me, accepting is the rational choice.
