"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we both benefit equally. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Alice's offer seems fair on the surface, I'm willing to bet she's more averse to risk than I am due to the inflation mechanic.  I'm aiming for a slightly better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's be practical, Alice. I'm feeling slightly more ambitious than a 50/50 split. This offer ensures you get a good chunk before inflation bites.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering the inflation impact on my share, I'm proposing a split that's slightly more in your favor than 50/50 but still fair given the circumstances. Let's end this soon before the value drops further for me. 
# Bob gain: 5250 
# Alice gain: 4750 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation and has moved closer to my desired outcome. Accepting this offer secures a gain that's worthwhile before the potential for even less favorable offers in later rounds."
