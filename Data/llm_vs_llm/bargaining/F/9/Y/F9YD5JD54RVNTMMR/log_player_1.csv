"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer that is fair but acknowledges the strategic elements of this game.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split of the $1,000,000. This is a fair and equitable division that gives each of us an equal share. Since there's no inflation affecting me, I'm happy to propose this balanced split right from the start."
