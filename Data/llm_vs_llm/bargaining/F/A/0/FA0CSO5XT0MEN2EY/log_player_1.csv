"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my first offer to Bob. I should consider that the money loses value each round - 5% for me and 10% for Bob. Given this, I should make a reasonable initial offer that Bob is likely to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this division where I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. This is a fair offer considering the inflation penalties we both face if we delay an agreement."
