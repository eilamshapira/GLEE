"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. The current offer is $4000 for me and $6000 for Alice
2. If I reject, we move to the next round where:
   * My money will be worth 10% less
   * Alice's money will be worth 5% less
   * I get to make the next offer

The current offer gives me 40% of the total. While this isn't ideal, if I reject:
* In the next round, my $4000 would only be worth $3600
* I'd need to make a significantly better offer to make up for the 10% loss

Since Alice's discount rate is lower than mine (5% vs 10%), she has more patience to negotiate. Also, with 12 rounds total, we risk getting nothing if we can't agree.
