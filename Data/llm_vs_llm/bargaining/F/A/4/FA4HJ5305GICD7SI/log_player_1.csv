"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair but slightly advantageous split for myself, considering that inflation will hurt me if we go to further rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose this split because it's close enough to 50-50 to be considered fair, but gives me a small advantage. If Bob rejects this, we'll move to the next round where the total value will be worth less to me due to 5% inflation, and Bob will make the next offer."
