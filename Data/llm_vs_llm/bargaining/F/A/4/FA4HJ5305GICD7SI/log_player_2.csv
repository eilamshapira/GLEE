"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me consider Alice's offer:

- Bob (me): $45
- Alice: $55

If I reject, I'll make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation. This means the $100 would effectively be worth $90 to me in the next round.

If I were to propose a 50/50 split next round ($50 each), that would be worth $45 to me after inflation (50 Ã— 0.9 = 45). This is the same as what Alice is offering now.

Given that there's no guarantee Alice would accept my counter-offer, and the current offer gives me the same effective value without risking further inflation, I'll accept.
