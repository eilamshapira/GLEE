450000.0,550000.0,"I propose a more balanced 55/45 split in my favor. This gives you $450000, which is still substantial. Remember that inflation affects me by 5% each round, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon. This is a fair compromise given that I'm facing value erosion with each round.",Bob,2,
