Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a more balanced 55/45 split in my favor. This gives you $450000, which is still substantial. Remember that inflation affects me by 5% each round, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon. This is a fair compromise given that I'm facing value erosion with each round. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
