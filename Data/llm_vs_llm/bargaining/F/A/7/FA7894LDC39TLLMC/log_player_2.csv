"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60/40 split. Let's take it and avoid inflation eating into our gains! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I receive $400,000 out of the $1,000,000, which is 40% of the total.

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but I need to account for 5% inflation. This means the total value to me would be $950,000 in the next round. 

If I were to propose a 50/50 split next round, I would get $475,000, which is better than the $400,000 currently offered. Even if Alice rejects my next offer, and we go to a third round with 10% total inflation, I could still potentially do better than accepting $400,000 now.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that's still reasonable but better for me, acknowledging the inflation factor.

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I propose a more balanced 55/45 split in my favor. This gives you $450,000, which is still substantial. Remember that inflation affects me by 5% each round, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon. This is a fair compromise given that I'm facing value erosion with each round.""}"
