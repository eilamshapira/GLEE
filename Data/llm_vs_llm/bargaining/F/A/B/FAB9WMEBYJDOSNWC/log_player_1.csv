"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll analyze this strategic situation. I need to make a fair offer to Bob while considering inflation.

Since inflation reduces the value of money by 5% each round, if this game continues to Round 2, the $100 will effectively be worth $95 to me. This means I should be willing to accept slightly less favorable terms now rather than waiting.

I'll propose a 50-50 split to start with a fair offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50,
""bob_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""I suggest an equal split of the money. This is fair for both of us, and accepting now means we both avoid the 5% inflation penalty that would reduce the value of our shares in the next round.""}"
