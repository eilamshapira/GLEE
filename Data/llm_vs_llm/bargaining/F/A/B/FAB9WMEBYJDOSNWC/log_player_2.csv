"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest an equal split of the money. This is fair for both of us, and accepting now means we both avoid the 5% inflation penalty that would reduce the value of our shares in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to think about this carefully. Alice is offering a 50-50 split, which gives me $50. If I reject this offer, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but the money will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation. So in the next round, the $100 would effectively be worth $90 to me.

If I were to counter-offer in the next round and ask for more than 50%, Alice might reject it, and we'd move to a third round where the money would be worth even less. The fair split being offered now guarantees me $50 without risk.
