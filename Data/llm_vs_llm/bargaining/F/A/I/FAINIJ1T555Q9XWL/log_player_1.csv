"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Split it evenly, fair deal""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A little more for me is fair 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept this offer, I'll get $45, but its value will be 5% less, so it's effectively worth $42.75 to me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less to me now (5% less in each of the two rounds that have passed), I'll try to make a more favorable offer to myself.

{""alice_gain"": 52, 
""bob_gain"": 48, 
""message"": ""My loss, your gain, still a good deal""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're losing value, I'm not 
# Alice gain: 43 
# Bob gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, if I accept this offer, I'll get $43, but its value will be 15.26% less (5% less in each of the 3 rounds that have passed, which is 1 - (1 - 0.05)^3), so it's effectively worth approximately $36.51 to me.

Considering this, I think I should accept the offer, as the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me.
