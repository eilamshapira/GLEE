"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer...

This is a fair 50-50 split, which is considered the most equitable division. While I could try to negotiate for more in the next round, there are a few considerations:

1. It's a reasonable offer that respects equality
2. There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in subsequent rounds
3. Since inflation doesn't affect my value (0% mentioned), there's no cost to accepting now

Given these factors, I'll accept this fair offer.
