"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we both get a good share before inflation affects us too much. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing an even split of $5,000 each. That seems fair on the surface, but I need to account for the 5% inflation penalty per round.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value will be worth 5% less to me. So even if I got more than $5,000 in the next round, it might not be worth as much as $5,000 now.

Since this is the first round and an even split is generally considered fair, I'll accept this offer. It gives me a guaranteed $5,000 without risking inflation losses.
