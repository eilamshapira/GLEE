"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly and avoid inflation losses 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
- She proposes an equal 50-50 split
- While fair at face value, I could potentially get more by making a counter-offer
- However, inflation will affect future rounds (even if just for Alice)
- A 50-50 split is generally considered fair in these scenarios
- Getting something now is better than risking getting nothing after 12 rounds

Given these factors, especially since it's a fair split with no loss to inflation, I'll accept.
