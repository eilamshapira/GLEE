"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer that considers the impact of inflation on my potential gains in future rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This gives you a substantial portion of $400,000 while recognizing that I face 10% inflation per round, which would reduce my gains if we continue to negotiate."
