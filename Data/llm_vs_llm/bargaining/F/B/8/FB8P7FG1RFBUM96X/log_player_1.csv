I propose a 90/10 split, with me taking 900,000 and Bob taking 100,000. It's a fair start and allows for potential negotiations in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split this time, with me taking 600,000 and Bob taking 400,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a substantial share."
