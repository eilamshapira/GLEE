"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a very low offer, giving me only 10% of the total sum. Given that inflation will reduce the value by 5% each round, I still have room to negotiate for a better deal. Even with inflation, rejecting this extremely uneven split is worth the risk.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split, though slightly in my favor since Alice opened with such an aggressive offer. I'll also make it a round number to make it easier to evaluate.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

This is a 60-40 split which is much more reasonable than the 90-10 split Alice proposed, while still giving me a better position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. With 9.75% inflation, if I accept $400,000 now, it's actually worth $361,000 in round 1 terms
2. This is much better than Alice's first offer of $100,000
3. If I reject, we go to round 4, where my money will be worth about 15% less than round 1
4. Alice seems to be moving towards a more reasonable position
5. While not ideal, this is a substantial offer, and the inflation risk is becoming significant
