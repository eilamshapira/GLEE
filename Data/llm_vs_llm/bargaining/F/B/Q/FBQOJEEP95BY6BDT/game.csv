60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get a significant portion right away without risking inflation.",Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, I understand we need to reach an agreement quickly due to inflation. I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. This is fair considering I'm already facing 20% inflation on my share this round. If we keep going back and forth, we'll both lose significant value. Let's settle this reasonably.",Bob,2,

65.0,35.0,"Bob, since inflation doesn't affect my share but increasingly affects yours, you should consider accepting this 65-35 split now. If we continue to later rounds, inflation will reduce your purchasing power even further, making this a better deal than what you might get later.",Alice,3,
