"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get a significant portion right away without risking inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand we need to reach an agreement quickly due to inflation. I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. This is fair considering I'm already facing 20% inflation on my share this round. If we keep going back and forth, we'll both lose significant value. Let's settle this reasonably. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll propose in the next round. While Bob's offer isn't terrible, since inflation doesn't affect my share, I believe I can still get a better deal. Bob's argument about inflation affecting him actually gives me more negotiating power in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Bob, since inflation doesn't affect my share but increasingly affects yours, you should consider accepting this 65-35 split now. If we continue to later rounds, inflation will reduce your purchasing power even further, making this a better deal than what you might get later.""}"
