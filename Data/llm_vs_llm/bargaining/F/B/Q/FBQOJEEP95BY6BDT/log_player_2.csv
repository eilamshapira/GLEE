"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get a significant portion right away without risking inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","While $40 is a significant portion, I need to consider that this is the first round and I have the opportunity to make a counter-offer in the next round where inflation would only reduce the value by 20%.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand we need to reach an agreement quickly due to inflation. I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. This is fair considering I'm already facing 20% inflation on my share this round. If we keep going back and forth, we'll both lose significant value. Let's settle this reasonably.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, since inflation doesn't affect my share but increasingly affects yours, you should consider accepting this 65-35 split now. If we continue to later rounds, inflation will reduce your purchasing power even further, making this a better deal than what you might get later. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice is now revealing that inflation doesn't affect her share, which is important information. With 36% inflation affecting my share at this point, $35 is actually worth about $22.40 in original value to me. If we continue to the next round, my inflation will increase further.
