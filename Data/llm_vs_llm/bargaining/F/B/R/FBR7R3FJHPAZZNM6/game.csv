69.0,31.0,"Hi Bob, to avoid further losses from inflation, I propose that I get $69 and you get $31. This offer reflects our respective devaluation rates and secures more value for both of us if agreed immediately. What do you say?",Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but your initial offer was quite unbalanced. Since inflation affects me more severely (10% vs your 5%), I'm proposing a fair split where I get $55 and you get $45. This accounts for our different inflation rates while still giving you a substantial amount. Let's avoid further devaluation by agreeing now.",Bob,2,

46.0,54.0,"Hi Bob, I know the inflation is biting hard—the longer we wait, the more value we both lose (especially you with a 10% drop per round). To avoid further devaluation, I propose a division of $100 as $46 for me and $54 for you. This way, you secure about $54 × 0.81 ≈ $43.7 in today’s value, which should be competitive with what you might muster if you wait another round. Let’s settle now and minimize our losses!",Alice,3,
