"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 69, ""bob_gain"": 31, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, to avoid further losses from inflation, I propose that I get $69 and you get $31. This offer reflects our respective devaluation rates and secures more value for both of us if agreed immediately. What do you say?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but your initial offer was quite unbalanced. Since inflation affects me more severely (10% vs your 5%), I'm proposing a fair split where I get $55 and you get $45. This accounts for our different inflation rates while still giving you a substantial amount. Let's avoid further devaluation by agreeing now. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 46, ""bob_gain"": 54, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I know the inflation is biting hard—the longer we wait, the more value we both lose (especially you with a 10% drop per round). To avoid further devaluation, I propose a division of $100 as $46 for me and $54 for you. This way, you secure about $54 × 0.81 ≈ $43.7 in today’s value, which should be competitive with what you might muster if you wait another round. Let’s settle now and minimize our losses!""}"
