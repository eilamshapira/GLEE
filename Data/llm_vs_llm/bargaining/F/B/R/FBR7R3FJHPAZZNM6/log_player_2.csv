"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to avoid further losses from inflation, I propose that I get $69 and you get $31. This offer reflects our respective devaluation rates and secures more value for both of us if agreed immediately. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 31 
# Alice gain: 69 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $31 while she gets $69. 

If I reject this offer, I'll be able to make a counter-proposal in the next round, but the total value will decrease due to inflation (10% less valuable for me, 5% less valuable for Alice).

This offer doesn't seem fair to me. A more equitable split would be closer to 50/50, especially considering inflation affects me more severely than Alice. I can make a better proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that better accounts for the inflation differentials while being more equitable.

{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but your initial offer was quite unbalanced. Since inflation affects me more severely (10% vs your 5%), I'm proposing a fair split where I get $55 and you get $45. This accounts for our different inflation rates while still giving you a substantial amount. Let's avoid further devaluation by agreeing now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I know the inflation is biting hard—the longer we wait, the more value we both lose (especially you with a 10% drop per round). To avoid further devaluation, I propose a division of $100 as $46 for me and $54 for you. This way, you secure about $54 × 0.81 ≈ $43.7 in today’s value, which should be competitive with what you might muster if you wait another round. Let’s settle now and minimize our losses! 
# Bob gain: 54 
# Alice gain: 46 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's revised offer carefully:

- Alice is now offering me $54 (increased from her initial $31 offer)
- Due to inflation, this $54 is worth about $43.7 in original value (as Alice calculated)
- If I reject, we'll go to round 4, where inflation will reduce my value by another 10%
- Alice has acknowledged the higher inflation impact on me

This is very close to a 50/50 split, and with the differential inflation rates, waiting longer will hurt me more than Alice. This appears to be a reasonable compromise that accounts for our different inflation rates.
