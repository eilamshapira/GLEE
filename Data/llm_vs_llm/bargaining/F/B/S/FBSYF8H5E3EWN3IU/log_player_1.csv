"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

My reasoning: I'm starting with a proposal that gives me a slight advantage, considering the potential for inflation to erode the value of the money for me in later rounds. This also leaves Bob with a significant portion, hopefully making it acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Reasoning: My potential gain is now worth 5% less. Bob's offer of $45 is acceptable given the inflation and the risk of further devaluation in future rounds. It's better to secure $45 now than risk getting less later."
