"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll play as Alice in this negotiation game. Since I'm making the first offer, I'll propose a fair split while considering that delay reduces the total value.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing an equal split of the $100. This is fair for both of us, and accepting now means we both maximize our gain before inflation reduces the total value in future rounds."
