Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, it's my turn to make an offer again. Remembering that the money is now worth 20% less to me than in the first round (10% less than round 2), I need to account for that. I'll try a slightly more aggressive approach, while still leaving Bob with a substantial amount.

  ""bob_gain"": 450000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, this is getting ridiculous. Bob's clearly trying to squeeze me out completely. While the inflation is hurting me, 10,000 even with a 27.1% reduction is still better than nothing, but it is close to the bottom line. I will try to do a last offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, this is my last offer. The inflation is really eating into my potential gains. At this point, I need to consider how much lower my potential gains will be if this is rejected and I have to accept Bob's offer in the next round. Given the trend, it will probably be very low. Thus, I'm going to make a slightly more favorable offer to Bob to try and secure a reasonable amount. I'll offer a 50/50 split, even though it hurts to do so with the inflation.
