"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be practical, Bob. A slightly larger share for me ensures we both benefit before inflation eats away at it. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

The offer is:
- $475,000 for me
- $525,000 for Alice
- A 50,000$ difference in Alice's favor

If I reject, we'll move to round 2, but the total amount will be worth 5% less ($950,000 total). My counteroffer would need to be significantly better to make up for this loss.

$475,000 is still a substantial amount, and fighting over a relatively small difference might lead to both of us losing more to inflation. The offer is reasonably fair, being close to a 50-50 split.
