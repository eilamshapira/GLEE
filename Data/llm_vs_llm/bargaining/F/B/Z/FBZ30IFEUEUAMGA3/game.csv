520000.0,480000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm offering a fair split that slightly favors me as the first mover. If we keep rejecting offers, we both lose significantly due to inflation, especially me. This is better than what you'd get from an even split next round due to our different inflation rates. Let's avoid the inflation losses and make a deal now.",Alice,1,

480000.0,520000.0,"Hi Alice, let's be reasonable. I understand you want a slight advantage as the first mover, but your initial offer was too low. This offer is the same split but reversed. It accounts for the inflation we both face, making it more beneficial than waiting for another round. Let's seal the deal and avoid unnecessary losses.",Bob,2,
