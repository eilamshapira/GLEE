"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll analyze this strategic situation carefully before making my offer.

Since I'm Alice and going first, I need to consider:
- The money loses 20% value for me each round vs 10% for Bob each round
- I'm at a disadvantage if we delay (greater time pressure)
- After 12 rounds, we both get nothing
- We need to reach agreement to both benefit

Let me make a fair first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 520000,
""bob_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a fair split that slightly favors me as the first mover. If we keep rejecting offers, we both lose significantly due to inflation, especially me. This is better than what you'd get from an even split next round due to our different inflation rates. Let's avoid the inflation losses and make a deal now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's be reasonable. I understand you want a slight advantage as the first mover, but your initial offer was too low. This offer is the same split but reversed. It accounts for the inflation we both face, making it more beneficial than waiting for another round. Let's seal the deal and avoid unnecessary losses. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
