6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get your money immediately without any inflation loss.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Hi Alice, considering the inflation affecting my share, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This way, we both get a reasonable amount, and I mitigate some of the inflation impact. Let's settle this soon!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, I'm meeting you in the middle here. A 55-45 split is fair, but in my favor since my initial offer was more reasonable. Let's not let inflation eat away at both our shares - this is a solid deal for both of us.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, with each round, inflation is significantly reducing the value of my share. I propose a 60-40 split in my favor to counteract this effect. We're running out of time, and I believe this is a fair compromise given the circumstances. Let's agree on this and end the game.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, let's be practical. I'm offering a 52-48 split that's fair to both of us. My inflation rate is lower than yours, so continuing to negotiate will hurt you more than me. This offer gives you a better share than my previous ones - let's conclude this deal now before inflation reduces both our gains further.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
3500.0,6500.0,"Alice, inflation is now taking a huge toll on my share, reducing its value by over 34%. To balance this out, I'm proposing a 65-35 split in my favor. We're nearing the end of the game, and this is crucial for me to get a fair amount. Let's agree on this to avoid further losses.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
5400.0,4600.0,"Bob, let's be rational. Your inflation rate (40.95%) is much higher than mine (22.62%), so each round hurts you significantly more than me. I'm offering you 4600 which, even with your higher inflation, is better than what you'd get after a few more rounds of negotiation. This 54-46 split is my most balanced offer yet - let's end this now before inflation diminishes both our shares further.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"Alice, with my share now worth nearly half due to inflation, I need to propose a 70-30 split in my favor to secure a reasonable amount. We're running out of rounds, and this is our chance to end the game before it's too late. Please consider this offer seriously.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
5600.0,4400.0,"Bob, we have only 3 rounds left after this. Your inflation is at 52.17% while mine is at 30.17%. If we continue, your share will be worth less than 2000 in real value. I'm actually increasing my demanded share to 5600 because my negotiating position is getting stronger with each round due to our inflation difference. Accept this offer now, or I'll have to demand even more in the next round as your buying power diminishes further.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
2500.0,7500.0,"Alice, we're down to the wire with only two rounds left after this one. My share's value has plummeted to less than half its original worth due to inflation. I'm proposing a 75-25 split in my favor to ensure I walk away with something meaningful. Let's end this now before it's too late for both of us.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
6500.0,3500.0,"Bob, this is the second-to-last round. Your inflation is at 61.26%, meaning your current share would be worth only about 1350 in real value. My 65-35 split gives you 3500, which even with your severe inflation is better than what you'd get by waiting for the final round. If we don't agree now, I'll have to demand even more in the final round as your buying power will be nearly gone. This is your best remaining option.",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,reject
2000.0,8000.0,"Alice, this is our last chance. My share's value has dropped dramatically due to inflation, and I need to propose an 80-20 split in my favor to salvage something from this game. It's now or neverâ€”let's agree on this and end the game.",Bob,12,
,,,Alice,12,reject
