Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation affecting my share, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This way, we both get a reasonable amount, and I mitigate some of the inflation impact. Let's settle this soon! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer since I know my portion loses only 5% value per round, and I started with a more generous offer to Bob. I'll make a new proposal in the next round that should be more appealing while still protecting my interests."

""bob_gain"": 4500,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, with each round, inflation is significantly reducing the value of my share. I propose a 60-40 split in my favor to counteract this effect. We're running out of time, and I believe this is a fair compromise given the circumstances. Let's agree on this and end the game. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer because even though inflation is affecting both of us, I'm still losing less value per round (14.26% vs 27.1%). Bob's offer of 4000 to me is too low considering I started with more generous terms. I'll make a more balanced counter-offer in the next round."

""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical. I'm offering a 52-48 split that's fair to both of us. My inflation rate is lower than yours, so continuing to negotiate will hurt you more than me. This offer gives you a better share than my previous ones - let's conclude this deal now before inflation reduces both our gains further.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, inflation is now taking a huge toll on my share, reducing its value by over 34%. To balance this out, I'm proposing a 65-35 split in my favor. We're nearing the end of the game, and this is crucial for me to get a fair amount. Let's agree on this to avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer because even though Bob's inflation rate is higher, the proposed split is too extreme. With my lower inflation rate (22.62% vs 40.95%), I'm in a better negotiating position. A 3500 share is too low considering I started with more balanced proposals. I'll counter with a more reasonable offer in the next round that better reflects our relative positions."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5400,
""bob_gain"": 4600,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be rational. Your inflation rate (40.95%) is much higher than mine (22.62%), so each round hurts you significantly more than me. I'm offering you 4600 which, even with your higher inflation, is better than what you'd get after a few more rounds of negotiation. This 54-46 split is my most balanced offer yet - let's end this now before inflation diminishes both our shares further.""}"

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, with my share now worth nearly half due to inflation, I need to propose a 70-30 split in my favor to secure a reasonable amount. We're running out of rounds, and this is our chance to end the game before it's too late. Please consider this offer seriously. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer because even though Bob's inflation rate is higher (52.17% vs my 30.17%), a 70-30 split is too extreme. With just 4 rounds left, I'm still in a stronger position due to my lower inflation rate. A 3000 share is far too low - even with significant inflation, I can still do better by continuing to negotiate. I'll make a more reasonable counter-offer that better reflects the time pressure we're both under."

Round 9

""bob_gain"": 4400,
""message"": ""Bob, we have only 3 rounds left after this. Your inflation is at 52.17% while mine is at 30.17%. If we continue, your share will be worth less than 2000 in real value.

Accept this offer now, or I'll have to demand even more in the next round as your buying power diminishes further.""}"

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're down to the wire with only two rounds left after this one. My share's value has plummeted to less than half its original worth due to inflation. I'm proposing a 75-25 split in my favor to ensure I walk away with something meaningful. Let's end this now before it's too late for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer because with only two rounds left, Bob's extremely high inflation rate (61.26%) puts me in an even stronger negotiating position. His 7500 is worth less than 3000 in real value for him, while my inflation rate (36.98%) is much more manageable. A 75-25 split is far too extreme given our positions. In the next round, I'll make an offer that reflects my strong negotiating position while still giving Bob a chance to salvage some value before his share becomes almost worthless due to inflation."

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6500,
""bob_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Bob, this is the second-to-last round. Your inflation is at 61.26%, meaning your current share would be worth only about 1350 in real value. My 65-35 split gives you 3500, which even with your severe inflation is better than what you'd get by waiting for the final round. If we don't agree now, I'll have to demand even more in the final round as your buying power will be nearly gone. This is your best remaining option.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 43.12% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 68.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is our last chance. My share's value has dropped dramatically due to inflation, and I need to propose an 80-20 split in my favor to salvage something from this game. It's now or neverâ€”let's agree on this and end the game. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this final offer. Since this is the last round and we failed to reach an agreement, we both get nothing. While this means I get zero, accepting Bob's offer would only give me 2000 (worth even less with inflation). Bob's extremely high inflation rate means his 8000 would be worth very little anyway (only about 2500 in original value due to 68.62% inflation). By making such an extreme offer in the final round instead of accepting my previous more balanced proposals, Bob has ensured we both walk away with nothing."
