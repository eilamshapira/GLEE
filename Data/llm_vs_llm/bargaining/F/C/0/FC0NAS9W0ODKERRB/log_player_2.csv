Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be rational. Your inflation rate (40.95%) is much higher than mine (22.62%), so each round hurts you significantly more than me. I'm offering you 4600 which, even with your higher inflation, is better than what you'd get after a few more rounds of negotiation.
