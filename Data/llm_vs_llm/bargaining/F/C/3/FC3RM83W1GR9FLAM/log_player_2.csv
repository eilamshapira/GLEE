"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 31.03 
# Alice gain: 68.97 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $31.03 while keeping $68.97 for herself. Given that inflation affects me more heavily (10% per round) compared to Alice's 5%, there's an incentive to resolve this sooner rather than later.

However, this initial split gives Alice more than twice what I would receive. If I reject this offer, I'll be able to make my own proposal in the next round, though the total value will be reduced due to inflation.

I think I can achieve a better outcome by making my own proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Now I'll make a counter-offer. Given the inflation rates (10% for me and 5% for Alice), it's in both of our interests to reach an agreement soon, but more urgently for me.

If Alice rejects my offer, we'll move to Round 3, where the money will be worth even less to both of us. For a fair split that accounts for our different inflation rates, I'll propose a more balanced division.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing an equal split of the money, which is fair and should be attractive enough for Alice to accept rather than waiting another round where both of us would lose value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this new offer. Alice is now offering me $35, which is an improvement from her initial offer of $31.03 in round 1. However, due to inflation, the $35 is actually worth about $28.35 to me (35 * 0.81 = 28.35) compared to round 1 values.

If I reject and we go to round 4, my inflation penalty increases to 29% from round 1 values, which significantly decreases the value of any future offer.

Alice's current offer of $35 (worth $28.35 to me after inflation) is less than my previous proposal of $50, but given the accelerating inflation effect on my side, continuing to negotiate may result in diminishing returns for me.
