"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's keep it simple and fair with an even 50-50 split for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair at face value. However, I need to account for the 5% inflation penalty that affects me each round.

If I accept now, I get $50.
If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, even if I asked for more and Alice accepted, the money would be worth 5% less to me. So I'd need to get at least $52.63 in the next round to equal what I can get now ($50).

Given the uncertainty of Alice accepting a higher offer from me, and the guaranteed 5% penalty for waiting, this seems like a reasonable offer.
