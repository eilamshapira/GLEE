"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is proposing I get $40 while she gets $60. 

Given that inflation affects me more severely (10% per round vs Alice's 5%), waiting has a higher cost for me. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, my $40 would already be worth less than it is now.

While I could try to negotiate for more, the asymmetric inflation rates put me at a disadvantage the longer we negotiate. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush, especially with higher inflation.
