"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

Alice is offering an even 50-50 split of the $10,000, which would give each of us $5,000.

For me, this is worth $5,000 as there's no inflation from my perspective.

For Alice, due to her 20% inflation per round, waiting another round would make the total pot worth only 80% of its current value to her. If we reject and go to another round, her maximum potential gain would decrease.

Since I can potentially make a better offer for myself in the next round and Alice would face inflation, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer that takes into account Alice's 20% inflation rate while still being reasonable enough for her to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

Since Alice faces 20% inflation per round, she's incentivized to accept sooner rather than later. She would get $4,000 now, which is better than potentially getting less in future rounds due to inflation. This offer acknowledges the asymmetric inflation rates while still giving her a substantial portion of the money."
