"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair starting point. Let's get this done! 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice offered me only $10 out of $100, which is quite low. 

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, Alice's value of money will decrease by 5% due to inflation. This means that in the next round, $100 will only be worth $95 to her. This gives me some negotiating leverage.

I can make a more favorable offer in the next round, and Alice might be more inclined to accept it rather than risk further devaluation of her share.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice values money 5% less now, I'll propose a more balanced split while acknowledging her first move.

{""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Since time affects your value of money more than mine, I suggest a more balanced split that benefits us both if we agree now. This way we can both walk away with a substantial amount.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I see your point. Let's try to get this done. You get the bigger slice. 
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
1. Alice is offering me exactly what I proposed in the last round ($60/$40 split)
2. For Alice, the $40 is now worth about 9.75% less than in round 1
3. If I reject, in the next round her money will be worth even less (about 14.75% less)
4. However, this is a fair offer that matches what I previously proposed as acceptable

Since Alice has come to meet my previous proposal, and this is a reasonable split, it would be counterproductive to reject it just to try to squeeze out a bit more. This is a fair deal.
