"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to make an offer to Bob, keeping in mind the decreasing value of the money for me with each round. I will start with a relatively generous offer to try and secure a deal early.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this. Bob is offering me $475,000. However, due to inflation, it's only worth 95% of its face value to me. So, effectively, I'm getting $475,000 * 0.95 = $451,250.

I will reject.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, it's my turn again. The money is now worth 10% less to me than at the start. I need to factor that in. I will try to be somewhat more aggressive this time, but still aiming for a quick resolution.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""bob_gain"": 480000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob's offer is $450,000. My inflation adjusted value is now $450,000 * (1 - 0.1426) = $450,000 * 0.8574 = $385,830. This is getting low.

I will reject.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I need to be more realistic. The money is now worth 19.05% less to me. That's a significant chunk. I'll try a slightly more desperate approach, but still better than nothing.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 425000 
# Bob gain: 575000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alright, Bob's offer is $425,000. My inflation adjusted value is $425,000 * (1 - 0.2262) = $425,000 * 0.7738 = $328,465.

I'm going to reject. We're running out of time, but I think I can still squeeze a bit more out of him.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I'm getting worried. The money is worth 26.5% less to me now. I need to make a decision. Let's make one last somewhat reasonable offer.

```json

""alice_gain"": 480000,
""bob_gain"": 520000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob's offer is $400,000. My inflation adjusted value is $400,000 * (1 - 0.3017) = $400,000 * 0.6983 = $279,320. This is very low, but we are running out of time.

Round 9

{
""alice_gain"": 460000,
""bob_gain"": 540000
}
