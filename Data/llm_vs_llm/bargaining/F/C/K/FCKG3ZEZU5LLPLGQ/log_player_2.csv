"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $450,000 and keeping $550,000 for herself
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. Alice's money will be worth 5% less next round, while mine keeps its value
4. $550,000 × 0.95 = $522,500 for Alice next round
5. This gives me negotiating leverage since waiting hurts Alice more than me
6. The offer isn't terrible but I can likely get a better deal

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll make a counter-offer that takes advantage of the asymmetric inflation while still being reasonable enough for Alice to consider accepting:

{""bob_gain"": 525000, ""alice_gain"": 475000}

This offer is strategic because:
1. It gives me a larger share than Alice's initial offer
2. It's still reasonable enough that Alice might accept rather than risk further devaluation
3. If Alice rejects, her portion will be worth even less next round (475000 × 0.95 = 451,250)
4. The total still adds up to 1,000,000
5. The split is close enough to 50/50 to appear fair while giving me an advantage"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
1. Alice is now offering me $480,000 (up from her initial $450,000)
2. She's asking for $520,000, but due to 9.75% inflation, it's only worth about $469,300 to her
3. If I reject, I can make another offer next round
4. In the next round, Alice's money will be worth 14.75% less than initial value
5. I have a strong negotiating position since time hurts Alice more than me
6. While this is a better offer than her first one, I can likely get an even better deal

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given the situation:
1. Alice's money is now subject to 14.75% inflation if she rejects
2. My previous offer of 525k/475k was rejected
3. Alice has shown willingness to increase my share (from 450k to 480k)
4. I can push for a better deal since inflation pressures Alice more

I'll increase my share while still leaving Alice enough to consider accepting:

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

This offer is strategic because:
1. It gives me a clear majority but isn't excessively greedy
2. For Alice, rejecting means her next share would be worth even less due to inflation
3. The offer shows I'm willing to negotiate but am aware of my stronger position
4. It's still fair enough that Alice might accept to avoid further losses"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
1. Alice is now offering a 50/50 split ($500,000 each)
2. Her share is actually worth only about $407,250 to her (due to 18.55% inflation)
3. My share is still worth the full $500,000
4. If I reject, her next share will be worth 23.55% less than initial value
5. She's showing significant movement from her initial position (from 450k to 500k for me)
6. However, given my stronger position due to inflation, I can still push for more

{""decision"": ""reject""}

The rejection is strategic because:
1. The inflation pressure is building significantly on Alice
2. She's already shown willingness to increase my share substantially
3. The next round will put even more pressure on her to make a better offer
4. We still have several rounds left to negotiate"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given the evolving situation:
1. Alice's money is now subject to 23.55% inflation if she rejects
2. She's moved from 450k to 500k for my share, showing increasing willingness to compromise
3. The inflation pressure on her side is becoming quite significant
4. We're halfway through the rounds, so time pressure is building

I'll push for a stronger position while still leaving it attractive enough for Alice to accept:

{""bob_gain"": 575000, ""alice_gain"": 425000}

This offer is strategic because:
1. For Alice, 425000 with 23.55% inflation is worth about 324,913
2. If she rejects, her next share will be worth even less
3. We're approaching a point where getting something is better than risking getting nothing
4. The offer is aggressive but not so extreme that it would certainly be rejected
5. It acknowledges the time pressure while leveraging my stronger position"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 520000 
# Alice gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $520,000 (up from her previous $500,000)
2. Her $480,000 is worth only about $352,848 to her (due to 26.49% inflation)
3. My $520,000 would still be worth the full amount
4. We're in round 7 of 12, so we're past the halfway point
5. While Alice continues to increase my share, the increase isn't as significant as the inflation impact
6. If I reject, her next share will be worth about 31.49% less than initial value

{""decision"": ""reject""}

The rejection is strategic because:
1. Alice's inflation penalty is becoming very severe
2. She's still making relatively small increases to my share
3. The gap between her nominal offer and its real value to her is growing
4. We still have 5 rounds left, but pressure is building to reach an agreement
5. Her pattern of increases suggests she has room to offer more"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given the current situation:
1. Alice's money is now subject to 31.49% inflation
2. She's gradually increased my share from 450k to 520k over the rounds
3. We have 4 rounds left after this one
4. The risk of getting nothing is becoming more real, but still manageable
5. Alice's demonstrated willingness to compromise suggests she wants to reach a deal

I'll make a stronger offer while still leaving it within the realm of acceptance:

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

This offer is strategic because:
1. For Alice, 400000 with 31.49% inflation is worth about 274,040
2. If she rejects, her next share will be worth even less
3. The offer represents a significant but not extreme increase from my previous offer
4. The remaining rounds and severe inflation pressure should make this more appealing to Alice
5. It's a psychologically significant number (60/40 split) that could serve as a focal point for agreement"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 540000 
# Alice gain: 460000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $540,000 (up from her previous $520,000)
2. Her $460,000 is worth only about $305,164 to her (due to 33.66% inflation)
3. We now have only 3 rounds left after this one
4. The risk of getting nothing is becoming more significant
5. Alice continues to make small increases to my share (20k more than last time)

While I believe I could get a better deal, the remaining rounds and risk factors are becoming concerning:
1. Only 3 rounds left means higher risk of no deal
2. Alice's pattern suggests she won't make dramatic increases
3. $540,000 is a substantial amount and better than risking nothing
4. The inflation penalty is already severe on Alice's side

Given these factors:

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm accepting because securing $540,000 now is better than risking either a small potential gain or, worse, nothing if we run out of rounds."
