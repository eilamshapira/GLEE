"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer, keeping in mind the inflation for me:

```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 52,
  ""alice_gain"": 48
}
```

My reasoning is that I need a slight advantage to compensate for the 10% loss I'll experience if we go to another round. This offer gives me a little more than her, but hopefully enough that she'll find it acceptable to avoid further delay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, round 4. The pressure is on! Considering I'm now losing 19% of the value, I need a significantly better offer.

```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 58,
  ""alice_gain"": 42
}
```

Explanation: I'm aiming for a larger slice to offset the inflation. If she rejects this, the inflation will hurt me even more, and it might be smarter to accept a future offer. This is my best shot at getting a decent amount given the circumstances."
