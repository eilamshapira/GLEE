"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Since this is the first round, this offer would give me $500,000, which is a fair 50-50 split. However, if I reject it:
1. The money will be worth 5% less for me in the next round
2. I'll get to make a counter-offer
3. I don't know how inflation affects Alice

If I reject, my $500,000 portion would be worth $475,000 in the next round just due to inflation. To make rejection worthwhile, I'd need to be very confident I could get significantly more than 50% in my counter-offer.

Given the equal split offer and the guaranteed loss from inflation, I'll accept this fair proposal.
