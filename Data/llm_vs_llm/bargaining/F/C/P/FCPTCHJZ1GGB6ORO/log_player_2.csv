"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 0 
# Alice gain: 10000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is completely unfair as it gives me nothing. In the next round, I can make a counter-proposal that would be more beneficial for both parties."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I propose a slightly higher share for myself to account for the 10% inflation penalty I'm facing. This is still a fair offer that gives Alice a substantial portion while protecting my interests against the time depreciation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 0 
# Alice gain: 10000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is still a completely unfair offer giving me nothing. Even with the 19% inflation penalty, it's better for me to continue negotiating rather than accept zero dollars. I'll make another proposal in the next round that considers both our interests."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

I'm increasing my proposed share to compensate for the growing inflation penalty (which is now 27.1% for the next round if this gets rejected). This is still a reasonable offer that gives Alice a significant portion while protecting me from the increasing inflation effect. If Alice rejects this, she risks getting a smaller share in future rounds as I'll need to request even more to offset the growing inflation penalty."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 0 
# Alice gain: 10000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice continues to propose completely unfair offers of $0 for me. Even with the 34.39% inflation penalty, getting nothing is still worse than continuing to negotiate. It's clear that Alice is trying to use the inflation penalty to pressure me into accepting nothing, but I would rather keep negotiating for a fair share than accept zero dollars."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000}

I need to increase my proposed share significantly because the inflation penalty is becoming severe (it will be 41.85% in the next round if this is rejected). At this point, even to get an effective $4,000 after inflation, I would need about $7,000 of the nominal amount. This offer still leaves Alice with $3,000, which is better than risking further rounds where I might need to ask for even more to compensate for inflation. I hope Alice recognizes that accepting this offer is better than continuing the cycle of rejections, as future offers will need to be even more skewed to compensate for my increasing inflation penalty."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100 
# Alice gain: 9900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice has finally offered something other than zero, but $100 (which would be worth only about $53.14 to me after the 46.86% inflation penalty) is still far too low. Even with the severe inflation penalty, it's better to continue negotiating for a fairer share than to accept such a minimal amount. The declining value due to inflation is concerning, but accepting just $53.14 in effective value would be worse than trying one more time for a fair division."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 8000, ""alice_gain"": 2000}

Given that the inflation penalty will be 52.17% in the next round if this is rejected, I need to ask for $8,000 to receive an effective amount of around $3,824 after inflation. This might seem high, but it's necessary due to the severe inflation penalty I'm facing. Alice still receives $2,000 with no penalty, which is better than risking future rounds where I would need to ask for even more to offset the rapidly growing inflation. The math shows that we both benefit from reaching an agreement now rather than continuing this pattern of rejections."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3875 
# Alice gain: 6125 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While not ideal, $3,875 with a 56.95% inflation penalty will give me approximately $1,668 in effective value. Given that the inflation penalty would increase to over 61% in the next round, and Alice has shown she's willing to hold out while I lose value, this is probably the best realistic outcome I can achieve. Further negotiation would likely result in even worse effective value for me due to the compounding inflation effect."
