"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering the inflation rates affect you more than me, so you should accept earlier rather than later.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose a 55-45 split with $4500 for me and $5500 for you. This is a better deal for you in the long run considering the inflation impact on both of us. Let's agree and make the most of it! 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Due to inflation, my $5500 is worth $5225 (5% less)
2. Bob's $4500 is worth $3600 (20% less)
3. This is actually a pretty fair offer, considering:
   - It's early in the game
   - The inflation rate affects Bob much more severely
   - The absolute value I'd receive is still good
   - Waiting longer will reduce both our gains
