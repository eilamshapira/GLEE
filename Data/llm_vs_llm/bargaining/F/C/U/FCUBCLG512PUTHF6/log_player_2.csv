Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6897, ""alice_gain"": 3103, ""message"": ""Alice, I know that as negotiations continue, our money loses value—your funds 10% per round and mine 5%. In light of our differing time‐preferences, I propose a division that reflects our discounting: I get $6,897 and you get $3,103. This split is fair in that it leaves you exactly as well off as you would be by waiting for your turn to propose, but without the further loss in value. I believe settling now is in both our best interests. What do you think?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the changing value of money, but your offer was still unfair. Let's try a more balanced split: I'll take 55% and you get 45%. This way we both get a decent share, and we can avoid further rounds of potential loss. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6400, ""alice_gain"": 3600, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concerns about fairness and the diminishing value of the money. In round 5, as the proposer, you might be able to secure a division favoring yourself, but the further delay would decrease the value of the pie even more for both of us. My offer gives you $3,600 nominal, which—at the current discount factor of 0.729—provides you with a utility roughly equivalent to what you'd expect in round 5. Meanwhile, I keep $6,400 nominal, which, at my current discount factor of 0.8574, maintains a fair share of the value. I believe this split reflects both the present values and the importance of settling now before more value is lost. Let’s conclude this deal in our mutual best interest.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing money with every round. Let's cut our losses and split the money evenly. 50/50 is the fairest solution at this point.

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4750, ""alice_gain"": 5250, ""message"": ""Alice, each round of delay costs us—my money loses 5% per round and yours 10%. If you reject my offer today (round 6), you'll become the proposer in round 7. However, due to your steeper discount rate, your best‐alternative in round 7 is worth roughly 0.9·[ (1 – 0.95)/(1 – 0.9·0.95)·10,000 ] ≈ $3,103 in today's terms. To induce you to settle now, I must offer you at least what you’d get by waiting. Given my own per‐round discounting (0.95 per round), this calculation forces me to leave you about $5,250 and keep $4,750 nominally in round 6. I believe this is the unique subgame perfect proposal for this stage—by accepting, you secure more than if we delay further. What do you say?""}"
