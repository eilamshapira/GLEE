"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's divide the money with me getting $6000 and you getting $4000. This is a fair offer, let's take it! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully, taking into account the 10% inflation penalty if I reject and move to the next round.

Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000, which is 40% of the total. If I reject, the money will be worth 10% less to me in the next round, meaning the total value to me would be $9,000. Even if I were to get 50% in the next round, that would be $4,500, which is only $500 more than what I'm being offered now.

Given the risk of continued negotiations and the guaranteed 10% loss of value, I'll accept this offer.
