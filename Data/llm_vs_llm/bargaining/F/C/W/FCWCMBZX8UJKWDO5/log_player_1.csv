"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me propose a division that considers both our interests.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a reasonable first offer that gives Bob a substantial portion while acknowledging my position as the first mover. Given that Bob faces a 5% depreciation per round, this should be an attractive offer for him to consider accepting now rather than waiting for future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer gives me less than half of the total amount. Since I don't face any inflation penalty in future rounds, while Bob does, I can afford to reject this and make a counter-offer in the next round. Bob's next share will be worth even less to him due to inflation, which should make him more willing to accept a more favorable split for me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that Bob faces a cumulative 10% depreciation at this point (5% per round since round 1), I'll adjust my offer to make it more appealing while still maintaining my advantage.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split. This is more generous than my first offer, and considering that Bob's portion is now worth about 10% less to him due to inflation, he should seriously consider accepting. If he rejects, his future gains will be worth even less to him, while my value remains stable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4300 
# Bob gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer because:
1. It still gives me less than half of the total amount (only 43%)
2. I have no inflation penalty, so I can afford to wait
3. Bob's inflation penalty is increasing (now at 14.26%), making each round more costly for him
4. In the next round, I can make a counter-offer that takes advantage of Bob's growing inflation pressure

The mounting inflation pressure on Bob's side strengthens my negotiating position with each round, while my value remains stable. This makes it rational to continue negotiating for a better share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob now faces a significant inflation penalty (14.26% and growing), I'll make an offer that acknowledges this pressure while maintaining my strong position.

{""alice_gain"": 5300, ""bob_gain"": 4700}

I'm proposing a 53-47 split. This is my most generous offer yet, giving Bob $4,700. Even though this is less than my previous offers in absolute terms, it's a strategic offer because:
1. Bob's inflation penalty means further delays will reduce his purchasing power even more
2. If he rejects this, the next round will have his portion worth almost 20% less than round 1
3. This is a better deal for him than my previous offers when accounting for inflation
4. It's still advantageous for me as I face no inflation penalty"
