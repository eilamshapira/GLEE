Let's aim for a fair and equal split."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is still trying to take a bigger share even with the inflation working against her.  I'll hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}
``` 

I'm increasing my share slightly, recognizing that the value of the money is decreasing for Alice. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is getting worse for me!  Alice needs to realize the money is rapidly losing value for her, not me. I'll continue to hold firm."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}
``` 

The clock is ticking, so I'm raising my stake.  Alice needs to make a decision soon, or we both lose."
