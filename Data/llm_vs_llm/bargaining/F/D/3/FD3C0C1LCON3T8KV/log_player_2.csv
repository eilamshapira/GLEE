"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, so we both benefit equally and fairly. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

If I reject this offer, I can make a counter-proposal next round, but the total amount will be worth 10% less to me (so the $10,000 becomes effectively $9,000 for my portion). Even if I proposed taking most of it in the next round, Alice could reject and we'd lose another 10% and so on.

The current offer of $5,000 is fair and avoids the risk of value loss through inflation. While I could try to negotiate for more, the inflation penalty makes accepting this even split the rational choice.
