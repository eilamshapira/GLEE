"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer for the first round, considering that we both want to maximize our gains but also need to be fair, especially given the different inflation rates.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm offering you $45, Bob, and I'll take $55. This is a fair split considering that my inflation rate is higher than yours (20% vs 10%), so I have more urgency to finish the game early. Let's make a deal now and both walk away with a good amount rather than letting inflation diminish our gains in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to make a reasonable offer that considers both our inflation rates and the remaining rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

Bob, I'm proposing an even 50-50 split. Since my inflation rate is higher (20% per round vs your 10%), we both benefit from concluding this sooner rather than later. This is a fair compromise from both our initial positions. Let's agree and finish now before both our potential gains decrease further."
