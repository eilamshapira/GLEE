5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing an equal split of $5000 each. This seems fair to start with. Keep in mind that with each round, the money is worth 5% less to me because of inflation, so I'd appreciate a prompt agreement.",Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, I appreciate your fair approach, but considering the inflation rate for me is 10%, I need a bit more to make it worthwhile. Let's settle with $5500 for me and $4500 for you. This way, we both get a good deal, and we can avoid further devaluation of the money.",Bob,2,

5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, thanks for sharing that you face 10% inflation per round. I face 5% inflation per round. Let's account for our different inflation rates fairly. I'm proposing $5200 for me and $4800 for you, which actually favors you slightly when considering our respective inflation penalties. Let's settle this now before we both lose more value.",Alice,3,
