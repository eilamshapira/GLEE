"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing an equal split of $5000 each. This seems fair to start with. Keep in mind that with each round, the money is worth 5% less to me because of inflation, so I'd appreciate a prompt agreement. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your fair approach, but considering the inflation rate for me is 10%, I need a bit more to make it worthwhile. Let's settle with $5500 for me and $4500 for you. This way, we both get a good deal, and we can avoid further devaluation of the money.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for sharing that you face 10% inflation per round. I face 5% inflation per round. Let's account for our different inflation rates fairly. I'm proposing $5200 for me and $4800 for you, which actually favors you slightly when considering our respective inflation penalties. Let's settle this now before we both lose more value. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
