"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer that considers the inflation rates and tries to be fair. Since I face a higher inflation rate (10% per round) than Bob (5% per round), I should propose a deal that acknowledges this difference.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split because we both benefit from reaching an agreement quickly due to inflation. Since my inflation rate is higher, I'm suggesting a slightly larger share to compensate for this disadvantage in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I notice that Bob simply flipped my first offer, giving himself the larger share. Let me propose a compromise that accounts for our different inflation rates while being more appealing to both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, 
""bob_gain"": 4800}

I'm reducing my requested amount to find a middle ground. Given that my inflation rate is higher (10% per round vs Bob's 5%), a quick agreement is especially valuable to me, but still beneficial for both of us. This offer is fair considering our different positions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
