"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for Round 1, considering the 5% inflation for me:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the inflation and the offer.

*   **My perspective (Alice):** My money is worth 5% less.
*   **Bob's perspective:** His money is worth 20% less.
*   **Offer:** Alice gets $400,000, Bob gets $600,000

Let's calculate the value in today's money for me, accounting for the round 1 inflation:

*   The original money is 1,000,000$ * 0.95 = 950,000$.

Therefore, I should respond with:

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, it's round 3. The value of the money for me is now further reduced by inflation.

Here's my offer:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```"
