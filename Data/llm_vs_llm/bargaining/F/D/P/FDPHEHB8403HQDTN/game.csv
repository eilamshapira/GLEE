55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, since I lose 20% value with each round, it's in both our interests to end this quickly. I'm offering you a substantial $45 while I keep $55. This is fair since if we go to another round, the total value decreases for me but not for you.",Alice,1,

40.0,60.0,"Alice, since you lose 20% value each round, $40 now is worth more to you than $55 would be next round (which would only be worth $44 to you). This is a fair offer considering the time pressure you face, and I suggest we conclude the deal here.",Bob,2,
