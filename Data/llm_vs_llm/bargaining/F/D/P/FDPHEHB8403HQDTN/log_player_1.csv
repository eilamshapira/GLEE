"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll propose a division that takes into account the inflation factor affecting me.

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, since I lose 20% value with each round, it's in both our interests to end this quickly. I'm offering you a substantial $45 while I keep $55. This is fair since if we go to another round, the total value decreases for me but not for you.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, since you lose 20% value each round, $40 now is worth more to you than $55 would be next round (which would only be worth $44 to you). This is a fair offer considering the time pressure you face, and I suggest we conclude the deal here. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Bob's offer carefully, considering the inflation that affects only me.

If I reject Bob's offer now, we'll go to Round 3 where I can make a new offer. However, in Round 3, the money would be worth another 20% less to me, meaning I'd only get 80% of the value of whatever amount I receive.

Bob is offering me $40 now. If I reject and go to Round 3, I'd need to secure more than $50 just to equal the current value of $40 (since $50 Ã— 0.8 = $40).

Since Bob has already shown he's willing to reject a 55/45 split, it's unlikely he'd accept an even higher amount in my favor in the next round. Additionally, the negotiating leverage shifts further in his favor with each round due to the asymmetric inflation.
