"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, since I lose 20% value with each round, it's in both our interests to end this quickly. I'm offering you a substantial $45 while I keep $55. This is fair since if we go to another round, the total value decreases for me but not for you. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is correct that she loses 20% value each round while I don't lose any value
2. If I reject and propose next round:
   * For me: I could propose a higher split
   * For Alice: Her $55 would be worth only $44 (80% of $55)
3. This means Alice would likely accept an even less favorable split next round
4. $45 is less than half, and I have the advantage of no value loss

Given these factors, I should reject and aim for a better split in the next round.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a strategic offer considering Alice's 20% value loss per round:

{""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Alice, since you lose 20% value each round, $40 now is worth more to you than $55 would be next round (which would only be worth $44 to you). This is a fair offer considering the time pressure you face, and I suggest we conclude the deal here.""}"
