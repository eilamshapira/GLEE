"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $45 out of $100
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, my money will be worth less in the next round
4. $45 now is better than $47.37 in the next round (due to 5% inflation)
5. This is a fairly reasonable first offer, close to 50-50
