"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's settle this quickly. A fair 60/40 split to avoid the effects of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me after each round, I'll make a reasonable offer to Alice. Considering the inflation effect, I'll propose a 50/50 split, but to account for the potential difference in inflation effects, I'll give Alice a slight edge.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the gesture in your last offer, but the split needs to be closer to my previous proposal. This is a fair deal considering the value is decreasing. 
# Bob gain: 425000 
# Alice gain: 575000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the money I would gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. This means that the $425,000 offered by Alice is actually worth approximately $425,000 * 0.9025 = $383,562.50 to me.

Given this, I'm not satisfied with the offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 9.75% less for me after 3 rounds (5% less after the first round and another 4.75% less after the second and third rounds, which is 1 - (1 - 0.05)(1 - 0.05)), and I rejected Alice's offer, I'll make a new proposal. 

To calculate the value, I'll consider the total decrease: 1 - (1 - 0.05)^3 = 0.1425 or 14.25% decrease. However, for simplicity, I'll use the approximate decrease after 3 rounds as 14.25% (5% + 4.75% + 4.5% which is an approximation).

My new offer will be closer to a 50/50 split, but I'll still give Alice a bit more to account for the potential difference in inflation effects and to try to end the game sooner.
