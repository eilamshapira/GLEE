"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to factor in the inflation for myself. Since the original $100 is now worth less, the effective amount I'm dealing with is reduced.

My effective ""money"" is now worth 95% of its original value due to 5% inflation.

Given Bob's offer:

*   Alice gets $50.

I have to decide whether to accept this.

Considering I get $50 now, and I have 10 more rounds if I reject, I should decide whether the possibility of a better outcome in a future round is better than the certain gain of $50 now.

I will **reject** the offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, it's my turn to make an offer in Round 3.  The money is worth even less to me now due to inflation. My current value is 95% of the last round, which was already at 95% of the original value: 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025. So, the money's value is now 90.25% of the original value to me.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this offer from Bob in Round 4, accounting for inflation.

*   **My Inflation:** The money is worth 14.26% less than in Round 1. So, I am effectively receiving $70.

I have to decide whether to accept this. I have 8 more rounds.

Considering I get $70 now, and I have 8 more rounds if I reject, I should decide whether the possibility of a better outcome in a future round is better than the certain gain of $70 now. In this situation, the amount of money I get is quite good.

I will **accept** the offer.
