"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that Alice's offer is extremely unfair, giving me only $1 out of the $1,000,000, I should reject this and make a more reasonable counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to make a strategic offer considering the 5% depreciation per round that affects only me. Since we're in round 2, and I've already lost 5% of value, I should offer something reasonable but favorable to me.

{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000}

I propose we split the money with $650,000 for me and $350,000 for you. This is a fair division that gives you a substantial amount while recognizing that delay disproportionately hurts my position due to the 5% inflation penalty I face each round."
