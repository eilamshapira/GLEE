Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise. I'll take $5500 and you get $4500. This way, we both get a fair share considering the inflation impact on you.

Even with the inflation, this deal is not favorable in the long run.  I need to aim for a more equitable split."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the impact of inflation on you. Let's meet in the middle. I'll take $5200 and you get $4800.

# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is still not acceptable. Though it appears closer to even, the impact of inflation means I lose significantly more than Alice gains. I need to hold out for a better deal."
