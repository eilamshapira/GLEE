4202.36,5797.64,"Hi Bob, I propose we avoid the losses from future rounds by settling now. Given that money loses value over time—5% per round for me and 10% per round for you—this split of $4202.36 for me and $5797.64 for you is fair based on our respective discounting. I hope you agree to this immediate agreement so we both secure as much value as possible.",Alice,1,

4000.0,6000.0,"Hi Alice, since we're now in round 2, the value of the money has decreased for both of us. My proposal is $6000 for me and $4000 for you. This takes into account the higher rate of value loss for me and still offers you a significant portion. Let's settle now to minimize further losses.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your prompt response, but I believe I can secure a better effective value for me if we continue the negotiation. Your current offer gives me $4000 in nominal terms, which, after the 5% reduction, is essentially worth $3800 compared to earlier proposals. I’d like to see if we can come up with a division that’s a bit more balanced given our respective discount rates. Let's proceed to the next round.",Alice,2,reject
3333.33,6666.67,"Hi Bob, here's my proposal for round 3: I take $3333.33 and you get $6666.67 in nominal terms. With this round’s discount factors (my money now has a multiplier of 0.9025 and yours 0.81), you would effectively receive about $6666.67 × 0.81 ≈ $5400. This is at least as good as what you'd expect by delaying the agreement further—especially since in round 4 your discount would drop to 0.729. I believe this offer safeguards both our interests by minimizing further losses. Let's settle now to secure these values before more value is eroded.",Alice,3,

3500.0,6500.0,"Hi Alice, we're now in round 4, and the value of the money has decreased even further for both of us. My proposal is $6500 for me and $3500 for you. Considering my money is now worth 27.1% less than in the first round and yours 14.26%, this split still offers you a substantial amount while trying to mitigate my higher rate of loss. Let's agree now to avoid further erosion of value.",Bob,4,
,,"Hi Bob, I understand the pressures of further discounts, and given that the money's value continues to erode with each round, your proposal is a prudent choice. While I'd ideally like to secure a bit more, it's clear that delaying further would only reduce our effective gains significantly. I accept your offer of $3500 for me and $6500 for you.",Alice,4,accept
