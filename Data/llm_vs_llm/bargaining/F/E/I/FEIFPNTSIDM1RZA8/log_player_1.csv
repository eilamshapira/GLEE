"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 4202.36, ""bob_gain"": 5797.64, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we avoid the losses from future rounds by settling now. Given that money loses value over time—5% per round for me and 10% per round for you—this split of $4,202.36 for me and $5,797.64 for you is fair based on our respective discounting. I hope you agree to this immediate agreement so we both secure as much value as possible.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since we're now in round 2, the value of the money has decreased for both of us. My proposal is $6000 for me and $4000 for you. This takes into account the higher rate of value loss for me and still offers you a significant portion. Let's settle now to minimize further losses. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your prompt response, but I believe I can secure a better effective value for me if we continue the negotiation. Your current offer gives me $4000 in nominal terms, which, after the 5% reduction, is essentially worth $3800 compared to earlier proposals. I’d like to see if we can come up with a division that’s a bit more balanced given our respective discount rates. Let's proceed to the next round.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 3333.33, ""bob_gain"": 6666.67, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal for round 3: I take $3333.33 and you get $6666.67 in nominal terms. With this round’s discount factors (my money now has a multiplier of 0.9025 and yours 0.81), you would effectively receive about $6666.67 × 0.81 ≈ $5400. This is at least as good as what you'd expect by delaying the agreement further—especially since in round 4 your discount would drop to 0.729. I believe this offer safeguards both our interests by minimizing further losses. Let's settle now to secure these values before more value is eroded.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, we're now in round 4, and the value of the money has decreased even further for both of us. My proposal is $6500 for me and $3500 for you. Considering my money is now worth 27.1% less than in the first round and yours 14.26%, this split still offers you a substantial amount while trying to mitigate my higher rate of loss. Let's agree now to avoid further erosion of value. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand the pressures of further discounts, and given that the money's value continues to erode with each round, your proposal is a prudent choice. While I'd ideally like to secure a bit more, it's clear that delaying further would only reduce our effective gains significantly. I accept your offer of $3500 for me and $6500 for you.""}"
