"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we avoid the losses from future rounds by settling now. Given that money loses value over time—5% per round for me and 10% per round for you—this split of $4202.36 for me and $5797.64 for you is fair based on our respective discounting. I hope you agree to this immediate agreement so we both secure as much value as possible. 
# Bob gain: 5797.64 
# Alice gain: 4202.36

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, since we're now in round 2, the value of the money has decreased for both of us. My proposal is $6000 for me and $4000 for you. This takes into account the higher rate of value loss for me and still offers you a significant portion. Let's settle now to minimize further losses.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal for round 3: I take $3333.33 and you get $6666.67 in nominal terms. With this round’s discount factors (my money now has a multiplier of 0.9025 and yours 0.81), you would effectively receive about $6666.67 × 0.81 ≈ $5400. This is at least as good as what you'd expect by delaying the agreement further—especially since in round 4 your discount would drop to 0.729. I believe this offer safeguards both our interests by minimizing further losses. Let's settle now to secure these values before more value is eroded. 
# Bob gain: 6666.67 
# Alice gain: 3333.33

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 6500,
  ""alice_gain"": 3500,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, we're now in round 4, and the value of the money has decreased even further for both of us. My proposal is $6500 for me and $3500 for you. Considering my money is now worth 27.1% less than in the first round and yours 14.26%, this split still offers you a substantial amount while trying to mitigate my higher rate of loss. Let's agree now to avoid further erosion of value.""
