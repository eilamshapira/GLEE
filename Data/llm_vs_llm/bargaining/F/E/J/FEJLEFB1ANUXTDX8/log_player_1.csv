This is my initial offer, I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, as the game favors me in the early rounds due to the lack of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I am adjusting it slightly. I'm offering $5,800 for myself and $4,200 for Bob. This offer is still favorable to me, but slightly more appealing to Bob as it recognizes the inflation factor that is now starting to play a role."
