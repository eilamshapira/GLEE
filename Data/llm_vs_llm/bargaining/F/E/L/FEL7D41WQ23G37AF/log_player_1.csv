"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get your money immediately without any inflation loss.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's split things more evenly. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. It's important to find a compromise we both find acceptable. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Reasoning (not part of response): The offer isn't favorable enough considering I can still make counter-offers. Even with 10% inflation on my side, I can still try to negotiate a better deal. If Bob rejected a 60-40 split, I might need to adjust my next offer, but I shouldn't accept this current proposal where I'm getting less than half."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Bob, I understand the need for compromise. I'm offering you a 45-55 split in my favor. This is more balanced than my first offer, and since we're in round 3, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon before inflation reduces the value further for me.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, time is ticking and the value is decreasing.  I'm proposing a 51-49 split in my favor. This is a very slight advantage for me, and considering the inflation, it's a fair deal. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Reasoning (not part of response): This is a reasonable offer to accept because:
1. The inflation has already reduced my gains by 27.1%, and waiting longer will only make it worse
2. The split is nearly even (51-49)
3. If I reject and continue negotiating, I risk losing more value to inflation
4. Bob has moved significantly from his initial position, showing good faith negotiation
5. There's no guarantee that future rounds will yield a better outcome for me"
