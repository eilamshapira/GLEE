"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get your money immediately without any inflation loss. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's see if we can negotiate a fairer split.  A 60-40 split heavily favors Alice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, let's split things more evenly. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. It's important to find a compromise we both find acceptable.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the need for compromise. I'm offering you a 45-55 split in my favor. This is more balanced than my first offer, and since we're in round 3, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon before inflation reduces the value further for me. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

While the split is more balanced, Alice is still getting a larger share. Considering the inflation is impacting her more each round,  I'll hold out for a slightly better deal."
