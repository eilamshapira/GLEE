"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me after the first round, the total amount I'm considering is $10,000 * 0.9 = $9,000. However, to make the offer, I'll still use the original $10,000 and consider the devaluation in my decision.

My offer is:
{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value of the money I would gain is $4300 * 0.81 (1 - 0.19) = $3483, and the value of the money Alice would gain is $5700 * 0.9025 (1 - 0.0975) = $5144.25.

Given this, I think Alice's offer is not in my favor.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 19% less for me after the first two rounds (10% each round), and another 10% less in this round, the total amount I'm considering is $10,000 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = $10,000 * 0.729. However, to make the offer, I'll still use the original $10,000 and consider the devaluation in my decision.

For Alice, the money is worth 5% less after the first round, 5% less after the second round, and 5% less after the third round, so the total amount she's considering is $10,000 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 = $10,000 * 0.857375.

My offer is:
{""bob_gain"": 5200, 
""alice_gain"": 4800}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value of the money I would gain is $4600 * 0.6561 (1 - 0.3439) = $3021.86, and the value of the money Alice would gain is $5400 * 0.8145 (1 - 0.1855) = $4399.30.

Given this, I think Alice's offer is still not in my favor, but the difference in value is decreasing due to inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 34.39% less for me after the first four rounds (10% + 10% + 10% + 10% - some compounding), and another 10% less in this round (but considering compounding), the total amount I'm considering is $10,000 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = $10,000 * 0.6561. However, to make the offer, I'll still use the original $10,000 and consider the devaluation in my decision.

For Alice, the money is worth 18.55% less after the first four rounds (5% + 5% + 5% + 5% - some compounding), and another 5% less after this round (but considering compounding), so the total amount she's considering is $10,000 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 = $10,000 * 0.8145 * 0.95 = $10,000 * 0.7733 (approx).

My offer is:
{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value of the money I would gain is $4800 * 0.5314 (1 - 0.4686) = $2548.72, and the value of the money Alice would gain is $5200 * 0.7351 (1 - 0.2649) = $3822.52.

Given this, I think Alice's offer is still not very favorable to me, but the value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. I should consider accepting an offer that gives me a reasonable amount before the value decreases further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 46.86% less for me after the first seven rounds, and another 10% less in this round (but considering compounding), the total amount I'm considering is $10,000 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = $10,000 * 0.4783 (approx).
