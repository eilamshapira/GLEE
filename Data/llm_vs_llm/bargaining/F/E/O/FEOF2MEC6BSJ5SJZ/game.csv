600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we split the money with me taking 60% and you taking 40%. This seems fair considering the effort and time we've put into this game. Let me know what you think!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Okay Alice, I think we can do better. I propose a 50/50 split. Let's end this quickly and fairly.",Bob,2,
550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer for a 50/50 split, but considering the inflation impact on my side, I feel it's not quite fair. How about I take 55% and you take 45%? This way, we can still end the game soon but with a bit more consideration for the inflation effect on my share.",Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, since we're now in round 3, and the value of the money is decreasing for me, I'm sticking with my previous offer of 55% for me and 45% for you. Let's settle this soon before the value drops even more.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
475000.0,525000.0,"Alice, the value is decreasing, but let's not be greedy. I'll offer you a slightly better deal than your last one, as I also want to secure a better outcome. This offer gives me slightly more, but it is the best offer you're getting from me. Take it or leave it.",Bob,4,
525000.0,475000.0,"Hi Bob, I understand your perspective, but given the significant inflation impact on my side, I can't accept your offer. How about we go with 52.5% for me and 47.5% for you? This way, we can both walk away with a reasonable share considering the decreasing value of the money.",Alice,4,reject
525000.0,475000.0,"Hi Bob, we're now in round 5, and the value of the money is dropping fast for me. Let's settle on 52.5% for me and 47.5% for you. It's a fair compromise given the inflation impact, and we can end this game soon.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, this is my final offer. I'm increasing my cut because the value is dropping. This is still a reasonable split considering the time we've invested. Take it.",Bob,6,
500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but the inflation is hitting me much harder. I can't accept your offer. How about we go for a 50/50 split now? It's fair and we can end this game before the value drops even further.",Alice,6,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Bob, we're now in round 7, and the value of the money is significantly less for me. Let's agree on a 50/50 split to end this game fairly and quickly. What do you say?",Alice,7,
