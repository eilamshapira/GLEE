"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take a larger share, but you still get a good chunk. Accept this and we can both walk away happy! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me $100,000 out of $1,000,000, which is only 10% of the total amount. While it's a significant sum, it's not a fair split.

Since there's no inflation effect on my end, I don't lose value by moving to the next round, and I'll get to make the next proposal. I can try to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split while still being strategic.

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. This way we both get a substantial amount and can end the negotiation now with a mutually beneficial outcome.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer of a 50-50 split, but I'm still aiming for a larger share given the potential for inflation. This offer is a compromise, giving you a decent amount while still ensuring I get the majority. Let's end this now and avoid further risks. 
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has only slightly improved her offer from $100,000 to $150,000, which is still just 15% of the total amount. While she mentions inflation affecting her position, I'm not pressured by inflation on my end, and we still have 9 rounds remaining. I can continue negotiating for a better split.

The fact that her gains are worth 9.75% less now actually weakens her bargaining position - she should be more motivated to reach a fair agreement quickly. I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that Alice is affected by inflation but seems to want a larger share, I'll adjust my offer to be more strategic while still being reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 400000,
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, so I'm offering you 60%. This is a very fair offer considering the inflation impact on your gains. If we keep negotiating, inflation will reduce your real gains even further. Let's conclude this now with this win-win proposal.""}"
