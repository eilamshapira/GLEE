"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
- Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000
- If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the money will be worth 5% less to me
- $4,000 now is better than $4,200 next round (which would be worth $3,990 after 5% inflation)
- While I could try to negotiate for more, there's a risk Alice rejects and we go multiple rounds with compounding inflation losses
