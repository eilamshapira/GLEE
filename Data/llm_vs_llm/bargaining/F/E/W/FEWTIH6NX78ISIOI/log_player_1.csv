"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60/40 seems reasonable""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you wanting a larger share, but that's a bit too high for me.  How about a slightly smaller split, closer to the middle? 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $5200, but it's worth 5% less than the original value. So, the actual value I'll get is $5200 * 0.95 = $4940.

Since Bob's offer is closer to a 50/50 split and considering the significant inflation penalty for him (20% less), I think it's a reasonable offer.
