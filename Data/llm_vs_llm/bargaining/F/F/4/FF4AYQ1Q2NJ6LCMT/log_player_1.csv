"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it equally. This way, we both get the same amount, and there's no advantage to either of us. Consider the effect of inflation if you reject this offer. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
