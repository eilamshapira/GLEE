"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly. I get a bit more to account for inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. This way, we both get a fair share and can avoid the effects of inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is hurting me more. I need a slightly larger share. This is a fair deal, given the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""I understand your concern about inflation. Let's compromise with this split. It's still fair, considering the decreasing value of the money.""}

My reasoning for this offer:
- After 4 rounds, if accepted, my gain would be equivalent to 4800*(1-0.2)^3 = 2112
- Alice's gain would be equivalent to 5200*(1-0.1)^3 = 3828
- This offer recognizes Alice's concern about inflation while still aiming to be fair for both parties. It's a compromise between Alice's previous demand for 6000 and an even split."
