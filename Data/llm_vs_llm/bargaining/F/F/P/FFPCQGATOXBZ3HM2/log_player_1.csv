Since my money loses value faster (10% vs your 5%), I'm asking for a bit more upfront. This way, we both get roughly equal value across time. Let's work together to reach a deal quickly!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your consideration for our different inflation rates, but I believe my proposal better balances our immediate needs with the time value of money. Given the urgency and the decreasing value of the pot, I propose taking $525000, leaving you with $475000. This split is fair considering the inflation impact on both of us and still allows us to conclude this quickly. Let's agree on this and end the game!

# Bob gain: 525000

I've adjusted my proposal to meet you partway. With my 10% inflation rate compared to your 5%, I genuinely need a slightly higher amount to achieve fair value. This 54/46 split accounts for our different inflation rates while being more balanced than my initial offer. Let's close this deal now before inflation erodes our potential gains further.""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need for a higher amount due to the higher inflation rate you're facing. However, I believe we can find a more equitable solution. My new proposal is for me to take $510000 and you to take $490000. This split is closer to an even division while still acknowledging the faster depreciation of your share. Let's agree on this and end the game before our potential gains diminish even further.
