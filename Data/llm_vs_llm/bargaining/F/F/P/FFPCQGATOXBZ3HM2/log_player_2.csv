"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that accounts for our different inflation rates. Since my money loses value faster (10% vs your 5%), I'm asking for a bit more upfront. This way, we both get roughly equal value across time. Let's work together to reach a deal quickly! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 525000,
  ""alice_gain"": 475000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your consideration for our different inflation rates, but I believe my proposal better balances our immediate needs with the time value of money. Given the urgency and the decreasing value of the pot, I propose taking $525,000, leaving you with $475,000. This split is fair considering the inflation impact on both of us and still allows us to conclude this quickly. Let's agree on this and end the game!""

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I've adjusted my proposal to meet you partway. With my 10% inflation rate compared to your 5%, I genuinely need a slightly higher amount to achieve fair value. This 54/46 split accounts for our different inflation rates while being more balanced than my initial offer. Let's close this deal now before inflation erodes our potential gains further. 
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 510000,
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for a higher amount due to the higher inflation rate you're facing. However, I believe we can find a more equitable solution. My new proposal is for me to take $510,000 and you to take $490,000. This split is closer to an even division while still acknowledging the faster depreciation of your share. Let's agree on this and end the game before our potential gains diminish even further.""

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your movement toward a more equitable solution. I've also moved considerably from my initial position. This 52.5/47.5 split is very close to your last offer and represents a fair compromise given our different inflation rates. We're now at round 5, and inflation is seriously eroding both our potential gains. Let's finalize this deal now and both walk away with a good outcome. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000
