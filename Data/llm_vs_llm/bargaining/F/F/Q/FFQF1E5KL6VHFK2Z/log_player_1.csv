"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to make a fair offer to Bob while considering the different inflation rates. Since I'm losing 10% value per round while Bob only loses 5%, I'm at a disadvantage if we drag this out.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing that I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000. This is a reasonable first offer that gives me slightly more, but is still fair enough that Bob should seriously consider accepting rather than moving to another round where both our potential gains decrease."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. If I reject, we'll move to round 3 where I can make another offer, but the money will be worth even less to both of us.

For me, $450,000 in round 2 is worth $450,000 × 0.9 = $405,000 in round 1 value.
If I reject and offer $550,000 to myself in round 3, it would be worth $550,000 × 0.9 × 0.9 = $445,500 in round 1 value.

Since Bob is offering me $450,000 which is worth $405,000 to me now, and making a counter-offer would result in further depreciation, I'll accept this offer.
