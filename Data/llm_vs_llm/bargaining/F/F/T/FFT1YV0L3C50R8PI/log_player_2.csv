"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice has offered a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance. However, with the 20% inflation penalty per round, if I reject now, the maximum I could get in the next round would be worth less. Even if I proposed taking all $10,000 in the next round, it would only be worth $8,000 to me due to inflation.

The current offer of $5,000 is better than what I might get after negotiating through inflation losses. It's a fair offer, and there's risk in rejecting it.
