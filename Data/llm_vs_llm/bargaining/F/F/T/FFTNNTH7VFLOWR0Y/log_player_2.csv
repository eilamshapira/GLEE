"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing that I receive $60 and you get $40. I believe this is fair given the dynamics of our negotiation; accepting it now avoids further delays and uncertainties. Looking forward to your response! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether to accept Alice's offer of $40 for me and $60 for her, or to reject it and make my own proposal in the next round.

While I could potentially propose a more favorable split for myself in the next round, there's no guarantee Alice would accept it. By accepting now, I secure a definite $40 rather than risking further negotiations that might not yield a better outcome.
