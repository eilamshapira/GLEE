"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a slightly favorable split for me, considering I need to account for the 5% inflation penalty if we go to another round.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45, which is a fair split considering the inflation risk I face in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Due to 5% inflation, if I accept $50 now, it's actually worth $47.50 to me ($50 * 0.95)
2. If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount I get will be worth another 5% less
3. Bob has shown he won't accept a very uneven split by rejecting my 55/45 offer
4. Getting $47.50 in real value is probably the best realistic outcome I can expect
