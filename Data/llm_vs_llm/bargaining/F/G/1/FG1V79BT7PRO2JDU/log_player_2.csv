"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $350,000 for me, $650,000 for Alice

2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make an offer
   * But money will be worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Alice
   * My $350,000 would become $332,500
   * Alice's $650,000 would become $585,000

3. Since Alice will lose more value (10%) than me (5%) in the next round, I have some leverage to negotiate for a better deal.

4. I could propose a more favorable split in the next round, and Alice might be more inclined to accept due to the higher depreciation rate she faces.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice faces a higher depreciation rate (10% vs my 5%), I'll propose a more balanced split, but still giving her a decent portion to make it attractive enough to accept. If she rejects, her share will depreciate more than mine in the next round.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split, which is fair and reasonable. This gives Alice a significant incentive to accept because:
1. It's still better than what she'd get after 10% depreciation if she rejects
2. It's a conventionally fair split
3. If she rejects, I could propose an even less favorable split for her in the next round, knowing her money depreciates faster"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Current offer: 
   * $420,000 for me (worth $379,050 after 9.75% depreciation)
   * $580,000 for Alice (worth $469,800 after 19% depreciation)

2. If I reject:
   * Next round the depreciation will be even higher
   * My money will be worth 14.75% less than original
   * Alice's money will be worth 29% less than original
   * The gap between our depreciation rates continues to grow

3. This offer is better than Alice's first offer ($350,000)
   * Even with depreciation, I'm getting more value than the first round
   * Further negotiations might lead to diminishing returns due to inflation

4. The risk of continued negotiation is getting higher as the value decreases for both parties
