Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even with inflation, accepting Alice's offer would leave me with significantly less than what I could potentially gain. 

* **Round 1 Offer (Alice):** $4000 (now worth ~ $3240 with 19% inflation)
* **Round 3 Offer (Alice):** $3000 

While the difference is only $240 in current value, I'm willing to gamble that I can secure a better deal in the next round.  My rejection might incentivize Alice to propose a fairer split."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The impact of inflation is becoming increasingly significant. While this offer isn't ideal, it's better to accept a less favorable deal now than risk getting even less in the future. 

Let's analyze:

* **Initial Offer (Round 1):** $4000 (now worth ~$2616 due to inflation) 
* **Current Offer (Round 5):** $3500 (worth ~$2323 due to inflation)

Although the current offer is less than the initial offer even with inflation accounted for, the difference is no longer as substantial.  Continuing to reject offers in the hope of getting a slightly better deal exposes me to a greater loss from inflation with each passing round."
