"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $200,000 while she gets $800,000. This is only 20% of the total for me.

Given that inflation reduces the value by 20% each round for me (but not for Alice), waiting has significant costs. If I reject now and propose in round 2, the total value to me would only be $800,000. If we go several rounds, the money becomes worth much less to me while Alice doesn't face this penalty.

Since this is the first round and the offer gives me a relatively small portion, I'll reject and make a counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since inflation reduces the money's value by 20% for me each round, I need to be strategic. If we reach round 3, the $1,000,000 will only be worth $640,000 to me due to two rounds of 20% inflation.

I'll propose a more equitable split that acknowledges the inflation pressure I face while still being fair enough that Alice might accept.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering a reasonable split that gives me a slight advantage to compensate for the inflation penalty I face. This is fair considering that Alice doesn't lose value with each round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this carefully. Alice has slightly improved her offer to me from $200,000 to $250,000.

Due to inflation, the money is now worth 36% less to me than in round 1. This means the $250,000 offered is effectively worth only $160,000 in round 1 terms (250,000 × 0.64 = 160,000).

If I reject and we continue to round 4, the inflation penalty will increase to 48.8% (1 - 0.8³), making the money even less valuable to me.

Given the increasing inflation penalty and that Alice has made only a modest improvement to her offer, I'll accept this offer rather than risk further devaluation.
