"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly to ensure we both get something! I'll take 60 and you get 40. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice proposes I take $40 while she takes $60. This isn't quite an equal split, but I need to factor in the 10% inflation penalty for each round if I reject. If I make a counter-offer in round 2, the total value would be reduced to $90, meaning even a perfect 50/50 split would only give me $45.

Given that inflation will reduce the total value by 10% each round, and there's always uncertainty about whether Alice would accept my counter-offer, I'll accept this first offer.
