"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this... Alice is offering me $40 while keeping $60 for herself. While this isn't an equal split, it's still a significant amount. Given that:

1. I'm guaranteed $40 if I accept now
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, there's no guarantee Alice will accept my counter-offer
4. Most importantly, I know there's no inflation affecting my value, so $40 now is worth the same as $40 later

While I could try to negotiate for more, this is a reasonable offer that gives me 40% of the total. The risk of getting a worse deal later might not be worth it.
