"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for the division of $10,000 in JSON format:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

My reasoning is that I'm making the first offer, so I'm aiming for a slightly more favorable split for myself. I believe this is a reasonable offer that Bob might accept, considering we both get a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
