"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair and split it evenly. What do you say, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

Alice is suggesting an even 50-50 split of the $1,000,000, which would give each of us $500,000.

While this is a fair offer, if I reject and move to the next round, I'll be able to make my own proposal. However, I need to consider that the total amount will decrease by 10% to $900,000.

Given that this is a perfectly fair initial offer and rejecting would reduce the total money available, I'll accept.
