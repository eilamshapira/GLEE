"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer that considers our respective inflation rates. Given that my inflation is higher (20% per round) compared to Bob's (5% per round), it makes sense to reach an agreement earlier rather than later.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering a fair split that slightly favors me. With each passing round, we both lose value, but I lose more due to my higher inflation rate. This offer allows us both to walk away with a substantial amount without risking further depreciation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to consider the inflation rates carefully here. After two rounds, I face 20% inflation per round while Bob faces 5% per round. Let me make a more strategic offer.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing an equal split of the money. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our positions. While my previous offer may have seemed too favorable to me, this 50-50 split is equitable and should be acceptable to both of us. Given that my inflation rate is higher than Bob's, it's in my interest to reach an agreement now rather than continuing to future rounds where my share would be worth even less."
