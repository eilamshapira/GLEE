"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
- She's offering me $450,000 and she gets $550,000
- If I reject, I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, but inflation will reduce the value by 5% for me
- For Alice, inflation is much higher at 20%

If I reject and we go to the next round, the $1,000,000 would be worth $950,000 to me and only $800,000 to Alice. This gives me significant leverage for a better deal.

Since Alice would lose much more value from inflation than I would, I believe I can negotiate a better split by rejecting this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since we're now in round 2, I need to account for the inflation effects. The $1,000,000 pot is now worth 5% less to me and 20% less to Alice.

Alice is much more affected by inflation than I am, which gives me leverage. She should be motivated to accept a reasonable offer now rather than risk another round of higher inflation for her.

I'll propose a split that's favorable to me but still gives Alice enough incentive to accept rather than continuing to the next round where she'd lose another 20% value.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000}

I'm proposing that I get $600,000 and Alice gets $400,000. This is a fair offer considering our differential inflation rates - if she rejects, she'll face much higher value loss than I will in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze Alice's new offer:

- Alice is now offering a 50-50 split: $500,000 for each of us
- Due to inflation, for me the money is worth 9.75% less than in round 1
- For Alice, the money is worth 36% less than in round 1
- If I reject, we go to round 4, where my inflation would be ~14.75% and Alice's would be ~48.8%

This is a significant improvement over her first offer, where she wanted $550,000. The differential inflation rates are putting pressure on Alice more than on me.

However, I need to consider if rejecting would lead to an even better offer. If we continue, Alice loses substantially more value, which means she should be willing to offer me more in the next round to avoid further inflation.

That said, $500,000 is a fair offer at this point, and there's always risk in continuing negotiations.
