60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get your money immediately without any inflation impact.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, I think a 55-45 split in my favor is fair this round. Given that we're now in round 2, I believe this offer still respects both our needs while adjusting for the game's dynamics. Let's settle this and move on!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
75.0,25.0,"Bob, I need a larger share to compensate for the significant value loss I'm experiencing. With my 75-25 proposal, I'll effectively receive much less than the nominal amount suggests, while you'll get your share's full value. This is fair given the circumstances.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
40.0,60.0,"Alice, considering the inflation impact on your share and the fact that we're now in round 4, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This offer takes into account the diminishing value of money for you while still providing a reasonable amount for both of us. Let's agree on this and end the game.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
85.0,15.0,"Bob, let's be practical. Due to the severe inflation penalty I'm facing, my $85 share is actually worth less than $44 to me after the inflation effect. Meanwhile, your $15 maintains its full value. This split is more equitable than it appears when considering these dynamics. Please accept so we can both benefit.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
35.0,65.0,"Alice, we're now in round 6, and the inflation is heavily affecting your share. My proposal of a 65-35 split in my favor still gives you a significant amount, considering the real value you're receiving. Let's end this game on a fair note for both of us.",Bob,6,
