"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get your money immediately without any inflation impact.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think a 55-45 split in my favor is fair this round. Given that we're now in round 2, I believe this offer still respects both our needs while adjusting for the game's dynamics. Let's settle this and move on! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Rationale (not part of response): With 20% inflation, $45 is only worth $36 to me now. I can make a better offer in the next round, even accounting for another 20% inflation hit. Bob might not know about my inflation penalty, so I can try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 75, 
""bob_gain"": 25,
""message"": ""Bob, I need a larger share to compensate for the significant value loss I'm experiencing. With my 75-25 proposal, I'll effectively receive much less than the nominal amount suggests, while you'll get your share's full value. This is fair given the circumstances.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the inflation impact on your share and the fact that we're now in round 4, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This offer takes into account the diminishing value of money for you while still providing a reasonable amount for both of us. Let's agree on this and end the game. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Rationale (not part of response): With 48.8% inflation, $40 is only worth about $20.48 to me now. Even with further inflation in the next round, I can still try to negotiate a better deal. Bob seems aware of my inflation penalty but isn't offering enough to compensate for it."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 85, 
""bob_gain"": 15,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical. Due to the severe inflation penalty I'm facing, my $85 share is actually worth less than $44 to me after the inflation effect. Meanwhile, your $15 maintains its full value. This split is more equitable than it appears when considering these dynamics. Please accept so we can both benefit.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're now in round 6, and the inflation is heavily affecting your share. My proposal of a 65-35 split in my favor still gives you a significant amount, considering the real value you're receiving. Let's end this game on a fair note for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Rationale (not part of response): With 67.23% inflation, my $35 is worth about $11.47 real value. If I reject, the next round will have 73.79% inflation, and even if I offer a very high split in my favor, Bob might reject again. With 6 rounds left but rapidly diminishing value, it's better to secure some value now than risk getting nothing if we reach round 12 without agreement."
