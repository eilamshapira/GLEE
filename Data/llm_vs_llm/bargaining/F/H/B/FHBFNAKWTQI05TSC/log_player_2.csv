"Round 1

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I need a larger share to compensate for the significant value loss I'm experiencing. With my 75-25 proposal, I'll effectively receive much less than the nominal amount suggests, while you'll get your share's full value. This is fair given the circumstances.

# Alice gain: 75

  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Alice, considering the inflation impact on your share and the fact that we're now in round 4, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This offer takes into account the diminishing value of money for you while still providing a reasonable amount for both of us. Let's agree on this and end the game.""

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical. Due to the severe inflation penalty I'm facing, my $85 share is actually worth less than $44 to me after the inflation effect. Meanwhile, your $15 maintains its full value. This split is more equitable than it appears when considering these dynamics. Please accept so we can both benefit.

# Alice gain: 85
