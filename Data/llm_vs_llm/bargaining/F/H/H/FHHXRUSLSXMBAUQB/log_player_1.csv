"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a fair and reasonable offer, splitting most of the money evenly while giving myself a small advantage.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split because it's close to equal but gives me a slight edge as the first mover. It's fair enough that Bob should seriously consider accepting it rather than risking further rounds where we might both end up with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is fairly reasonable, giving each of us close to half of the total amount. While it's slightly in his favor, the difference is modest ($400), and we're already in round 2. Accepting this offer now guarantees us both a good outcome, while continuing to negotiate risks both of us getting nothing if we can't reach an agreement within the remaining rounds.
