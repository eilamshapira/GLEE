"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me 4500$ out of 10000$
2. While not an even split, it's a reasonable first offer (45%)
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer, but there's risk Alice might reject
4. Inflation isn't affecting my value, so no pressure from that
5. We have plenty of rounds left, but no guarantee of a better deal

Given that it's a decent offer and there's risk in rejection, I'll accept.
