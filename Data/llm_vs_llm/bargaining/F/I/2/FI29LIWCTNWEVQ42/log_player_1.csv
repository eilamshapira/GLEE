"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60/40 seems reasonable""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, but I'm willing to negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same, but Bob's offer gives me less than my initial offer, and considering Bob's gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect on Bob's gain, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself while still being reasonable. Since Bob's gain is worth 5% less in each round, and this is the third round, his gain will be worth approximately 5% * 2 = 10% less than the initial value (5% less in round 2, and another 5% less in round 3, but compounded).

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to take a bit more. Let's settle this.""
}
```"
