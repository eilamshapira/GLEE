"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Split it evenly, fair for both""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a bit more here, but it's still a good deal for you. Let's settle this round considering the inflation  
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $4000 I would gain is actually worth $4000 * 0.9 = $3600 to me, and the $6000 Bob would gain is worth $6000 * 0.8 = $4800 to him.

Given this, I think I can do better. My response is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth 10% less for me in each round, and 20% less for Bob. 

In Round 3, the money I gain is worth 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 of its original value, and the money Bob gains is worth 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 of its original value.

To make it fair, I'll take a bit more this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a better deal for both""
}
```"
