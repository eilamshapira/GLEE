"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we both get a good share before inflation kicks in. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer strategically:

1. She's offering a 50-50 split ($5000 each)
2. This is a fair and equitable offer
3. There are 12 rounds possible, but inflation might affect Alice's decisions
4. Getting $5000 now is a guaranteed good outcome
5. If I reject, I might get more in my counter-offer, but Alice might also reject, and we'd risk further rounds

Given that:
- The offer is fair
- There's no inflation penalty for me, but potential risk in future rounds
- We have a guaranteed good outcome now
- First-round cooperation often sets a positive tone
