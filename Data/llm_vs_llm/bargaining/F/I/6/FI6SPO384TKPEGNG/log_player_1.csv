"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by offering a fair division with a slight advantage for me since I'll be affected by inflation if we don't agree now.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I believe this is a fair split that recognizes both our needs to reach an agreement quickly. With 5% inflation affecting me each round, it makes sense to resolve this promptly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll adjust my offer considering the inflation effects and our negotiation so far.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an equal split of $5000 each. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our positions. Since I'm affected by 5% inflation each round, reaching an agreement now benefits me, and this even split should be acceptable to both of us."
