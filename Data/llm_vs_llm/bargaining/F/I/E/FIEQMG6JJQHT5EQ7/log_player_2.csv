"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's accept this fair division. It's a good start for both of us! 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically.

Alice is offering me $200,000 (20%) while keeping $800,000 (80%) for herself. This is not a particularly fair split.

If I reject:
- Next round I can make a counter-proposal
- The money will be worth 20% less to me (but only 10% less to Alice)
- I need to factor in that we have a 12-round limit

While the money devaluation works against me more than Alice, we're still in round 1 and I have room to negotiate for a better deal. This initial offer is too skewed in Alice's favor.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split, but considering that money devalues faster for me than for Alice, I should still aim for a favorable deal now.
