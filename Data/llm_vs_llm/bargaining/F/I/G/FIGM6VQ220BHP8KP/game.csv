50.0,50.0,"Hi Bob, I propose an equal split: $50 each. Since waiting further will reduce the value for me, it makes sense to settle now. Let's agree on a fair division immediately.",Alice,1,

40.0,60.0,"Hi Alice, since I understand that you face inflation with each passing round while I don't, I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This is still fair considering that waiting another round would decrease the value for you further, making this deal better for you now than an equal split later.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, given the 10% inflation hit on my share in every subsequent round, your offer of $40 for me (which is effectively $36 in today's terms) is better than what I can expect by prolonging the negotiation. Accepting now minimizes further losses on my side. Let's settle on this division.",Alice,2,accept
