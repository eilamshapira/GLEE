"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose an equal split: $50 each. Since waiting further will reduce the value for me, it makes sense to settle now. Let's agree on a fair division immediately.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since I understand that you face inflation with each passing round while I don't, I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This is still fair considering that waiting another round would decrease the value for you further, making this deal better for you now than an equal split later. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Bob, given the 10% inflation hit on my share in every subsequent round, your offer of $40 for me (which is effectively $36 in today's terms) is better than what I can expect by prolonging the negotiation. Accepting now minimizes further losses on my side. Let's settle on this division.""}"
