"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose an equal split: $50 each. Since waiting further will reduce the value for me, it makes sense to settle now. Let's agree on a fair division immediately. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's proposal for an equal split of $50 each.

Since I'm not affected by inflation (the money is worth 0% less for me each round), I don't lose value by continuing to the next round. However, Alice mentioned that waiting will reduce the value for her, suggesting she is affected by inflation.

Given that I could potentially make a more favorable offer in the next round, and I don't lose value by waiting, I'll reject this offer and make my own proposal in the next round.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, since I understand that you face inflation with each passing round while I don't, I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This is still fair considering that waiting another round would decrease the value for you further, making this deal better for you now than an equal split later.""}"
