Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000,""bob_gain"": 400000,""message"": ""Let's start with this fair proposal. You get 400k, I get 600k. It's a good deal for both of us!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since we both face inflation penalties with each round, I'm proposing a more balanced split where I get $550k and you get $450k. This is fair considering we both need to reach an agreement soon to avoid losing value. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
