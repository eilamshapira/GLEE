"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with this fair proposal. You get 400k, I get 600k. It's a good deal for both of us! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully given the inflation penalty. If I reject, the money will be worth 10% less in the next round, but I'll get to make a counter-offer.

Current offer: I receive $400,000, Alice receives $600,000.
If I reject, in the next round the money's total value to me will be $900,000.

While $400,000 is a substantial amount, it's less than half of the total. Since I'll be making the next offer and only face a 10% inflation penalty, I believe I can propose a more favorable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counter-offer that accounts for the inflation while being fair to both parties.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, since we both face inflation penalties with each round, I'm proposing a more balanced split where I get $550k and you get $450k. This is fair considering we both need to reach an agreement soon to avoid losing value.""}"
