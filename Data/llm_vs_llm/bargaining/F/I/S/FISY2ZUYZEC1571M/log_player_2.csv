Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

With this offer, I'm aiming to get a slightly larger share of the money while still giving Alice a reasonable amount. Let's see if Alice accepts this offer."

# Alice gain: 4500

Although the money is worth slightly less due to inflation, accepting this offer ensures that I get a fair share of the money. Let's proceed with accepting Alice's offer and finish the game."
