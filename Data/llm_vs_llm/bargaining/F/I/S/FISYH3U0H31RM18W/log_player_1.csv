"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. I will start with a relatively fair offer, but slightly favoring myself, accounting for the potential for lost value due to inflation in future rounds.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 44.44 
# Bob gain: 55.56 
Do you accept this offer?","The offer is now worth 20% less to me. Bob's offer gives me $44.44. To calculate the equivalent value in round 1 dollars, I need to multiply by 1.2: $44.44 * 1.2 = $53.33.

Since $53.33 is less than my initial offer of $55, and also less than half of the original $100, I will reject the offer.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, it seems Bob is trying to be a little aggressive. Inflation is hurting us both, but I need to consider the long game. Since he rejected 55/45, I'll try a slightly more generous offer to see if we can reach an agreement. I will factor in the 20% reduction in value.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 52,
""bob_gain"": 48
}
```"
