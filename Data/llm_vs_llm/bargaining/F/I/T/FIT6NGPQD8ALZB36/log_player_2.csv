"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $400,000 while she gets $600,000. Since this is only the first round and I don't face any inflation penalty (though Alice might), I have the option to reject and make my own counteroffer.

Given that we're dividing $1,000,000, I believe I can negotiate for a more favorable split, especially since I'll be making the next offer if I reject.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that's more favorable to me while still being fair to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering a split where I receive $550,000 and Alice receives $450,000. This gives me a slight advantage while still offering Alice a substantial amount. Since inflation doesn't affect me, I can afford to be somewhat patient in negotiations, but I also don't want to risk going through too many rounds."
