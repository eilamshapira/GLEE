"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's make this quick and fair. I'll take $450000 and you get $550000. We both win! 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $550,000 out of the $1,000,000, which is more than half. It's a reasonable first offer.

If I reject and we move to the next round, I'll make a counter-offer, but Alice will value the money 10% less due to inflation (while my valuation remains the same). This gives me some negotiating leverage for future rounds.

Given that I'm getting more than half already and the offer is fair, I'll accept this proposal.
