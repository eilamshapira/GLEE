"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. My offer for round 1 is:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I see the offer from Bob.

Considering inflation, the $1 I receive now is only worth $0.90 compared to round 1. I need to factor that in.

My decision is:
```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, it's my turn to propose again. With each round, the value of the money for me decreases by 10%.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I've received Bob's offer in round 4. I need to consider the cumulative inflation. The $1 I receive now is only worth 0.729 of the original value.

My decision is:
```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, it's my turn to propose again. The value of money for me is decreasing due to inflation.

Considering the risk of getting nothing if we reach round 12, I will try a more balanced offer this time.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
