"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a counter-offer in the next round. 90-10 split in Alice's favor is too uneven."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I propose a fair 50-50 split of the money, which would give each of us $50. This is the most equitable solution and should be acceptable to both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Since Alice's money is worth 19% less due to inflation, her $70 is actually worth about $56.70 now. While the offer is better than the first one, I believe we can still reach a more equitable solution. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55}

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split for Alice while still maintaining reasonable fairness. Given that Alice's gains are affected by inflation, this $55 is worth about $44.55 to her now. This offer gives her a bit more nominal value to compensate for her inflation loss while still ensuring I receive a fair share."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While nominally I'm getting $40, Alice's $60 is actually worth only about $39.37 to her due to the 34.39% inflation on her side. This makes the actual value split fairly even, and continuing to negotiate might lead to worse outcomes for both of us due to increasing inflation. It's a reasonable compromise."
