"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer and think about my options.

Alice is proposing that I (Bob) get $4,000 while she gets $6,000. That's a 40/60 split in her favor.

If I reject, I'll get to make a counter-offer in the next round, but the total amount will decrease by 5% (from $10,000 to $9,500). This means there will be less total money to divide.

While I could propose a more favorable split for myself in the next round, Alice might reject it, leading to further rounds and more depreciation of the total amount.

Given the 5% inflation penalty and that $4,000 is a substantial portion of the total, I'll accept this offer.
