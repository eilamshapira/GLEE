"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $4,000 out of the $10,000, which is 40% of the total. 

If I reject and we go to the next round, the money will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation. So the $10,000 pot would effectively be worth $9,000 to me in the next round. If I were to propose a 50-50 split then, I'd get $5,000, which would be worth $4,500 to me after inflation.

While I could potentially get more by rejecting this offer, there's also risk involved if we continue negotiating for many rounds. The inflation effect compounds, and if Alice rejects my counter-offers, we both might end up with nothing.

Given these considerations, I'll accept Alice's offer of $4,000.
