"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While this offer is slightly better than Alice's first offer, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  The impact of inflation is starting to become significant, but holding out for a more equitable split is likely still the best strategy."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000} 

**Reasoning:**

Given the increasing impact of inflation, it's time to propose a more appealing offer to Alice. A 50/50 split is the fairest option and ensures I secure a reasonable amount before inflation further erodes the value."
