"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it evenly, fair for both 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice proposes a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 10% inflation, if I reject:
   - Next round the $10,000 will only be worth $9,000 to me
   - Even if I get all $9,000, that's less than two $5,000 shares now
4. The even split now ($5,000) is better than any possible outcome after inflation
