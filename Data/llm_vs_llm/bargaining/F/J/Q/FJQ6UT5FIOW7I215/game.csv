6000.0,4000.0,"Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this division is fair and benefits us both.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4700.0,5300.0,"Alice, I propose we split the money with me receiving $5300 and you receiving $4700. Given that each round further erodes our shares—5% for me and 10% for you—settling now ensures you get a higher effective value than waiting and risking additional discounting. Let’s agree now and finish the game on a fair note for both of us.",Bob,2,

5600.0,4400.0,"Bob, it's clear we both want to maximize our gains. I've adjusted my offer slightly to reflect the impact of inflation on both our ends.  This offer ensures a good deal for both of us in these later rounds. Let's close this out.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
3100.0,6900.0,"Alice, as we move into round 4 the inflation has further eroded the value of the pie (my share is now worth only 85.74% of its original value and yours only 72.9%). If you reject and become proposer in the next round, your effective payoff – after your own 10% per round discount – would be roughly equivalent to receiving about $3100 now. To avoid further losses from waiting, I’m offering you $3100 today and keeping $6900 for myself. I believe this offer fairly reflects the reduced values we both face. Let's close this deal now before the inflation takes even more away from us.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation is hurting both of us. Dragging this out any further will only lead to smaller gains for both of us. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical outcome at this point. Take it or leave it.",Alice,5,
