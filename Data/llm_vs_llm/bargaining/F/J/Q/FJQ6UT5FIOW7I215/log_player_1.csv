Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose we split the money with me receiving $5300 and you receiving $4700. Given that each round further erodes our shares—5% for me and 10% for you—settling now ensures you get a higher effective value than waiting and risking additional discounting. Let’s agree now and finish the game on a fair note for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4700 
# Bob gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, as we move into round 4 the inflation has further eroded the value of the pie (my share is now worth only 85.74% of its original value and yours only 72.9%). If you reject and become proposer in the next round, your effective payoff – after your own 10% per round discount – would be roughly equivalent to receiving about $3100 now. To avoid further losses from waiting, I’m offering you $3100 today and keeping $6900 for myself. I believe this offer fairly reflects the reduced values we both face. Let's close this deal now before the inflation takes even more away from us. 
# Alice gain: 3100 
# Bob gain: 6900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Bob's argument is designed to scare me, but the situation is not as dire as he makes it sound.  While my potential gains are shrinking, so are his. He's banking on me panicking and accepting a much lower share than I need to. I'm willing to gamble that he'll become more reasonable in the next round."
