"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5300, ""alice_gain"": 4700, ""message"": ""Alice, I propose we split the money with me receiving $5300 and you receiving $4700. Given that each round further erodes our shares—5% for me and 10% for you—settling now ensures you get a higher effective value than waiting and risking additional discounting. Let’s agree now and finish the game on a fair note for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want to maximize our gains. I've adjusted my offer slightly to reflect the impact of inflation on both our ends.  This offer ensures a good deal for both of us in these later rounds. Let's close this out. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6900, ""alice_gain"": 3100, ""message"": ""Alice, as we move into round 4 the inflation has further eroded the value of the pie (my share is now worth only 85.74% of its original value and yours only 72.9%). If you reject and become proposer in the next round, your effective payoff – after your own 10% per round discount – would be roughly equivalent to receiving about $3100 now. To avoid further losses from waiting, I’m offering you $3100 today and keeping $6900 for myself. I believe this offer fairly reflects the reduced values we both face. Let's close this deal now before the inflation takes even more away from us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation is hurting both of us. Dragging this out any further will only lead to smaller gains for both of us. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical outcome at this point. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
