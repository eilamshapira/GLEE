600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, which is fair considering I face 20% inflation each round. If we delay, my purchasing power decreases significantly. This offer gives us both substantial value now rather than risking getting nothing after 12 rounds.",Alice,1,

500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but I propose a fair 50-50 split. This is the most equitable division, and you'll still get more value accepting now than waiting for future rounds if you truly face 20% inflation. Let's be fair and finish this now.",Bob,2,

650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, I rejected your 50-50 offer because it doesn't account for my 20% inflation penalty. Each round I wait, my purchasing power decreases significantly. A 65/35 split better balances our outcomes since you face no inflation. If we keep rejecting offers, we're both at risk of getting nothing after 12 rounds, and the money becomes worth less to me with each passing round.",Alice,3,

550000.0,450000.0,"Alice, I understand your inflation problem is real, and I'm offering a more favorable split for you at 55/45. This is better than continuing further rounds where your money loses more value. With your 20% per-round inflation, getting $550000 now is worth much more than a larger number later. This is my best offer considering our different inflation situations.",Bob,4,
