"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, which is fair considering I face 20% inflation each round. If we delay, my purchasing power decreases significantly. This offer gives us both substantial value now rather than risking getting nothing after 12 rounds. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice claims she faces 20% inflation per round, but I don't know if that's true.
2. I face 0% inflation, so time doesn't pressure me.
3. $400,000 is a significant amount, but less than half.
4. I can make a counter-offer next round with no loss to my purchasing power.
5. Alice might be bluffing about her inflation rate to get a better deal.

Since I have no time pressure and can potentially negotiate a better deal, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer while acknowledging Alice's claimed situation:

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but I propose a fair 50-50 split. This is the most equitable division, and you'll still get more value accepting now than waiting for future rounds if you truly face 20% inflation. Let's be fair and finish this now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I rejected your 50-50 offer because it doesn't account for my 20% inflation penalty. Each round I wait, my purchasing power decreases significantly. A 65/35 split better balances our outcomes since you face no inflation. If we keep rejecting offers, we're both at risk of getting nothing after 12 rounds, and the money becomes worth less to me with each passing round. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. I now know for certain that Alice faces significant inflation (36% less value after 2 rounds).
2. Her claim about 20% per round inflation appears truthful based on this information.
3. She's actually offering me less than before ($350K vs $400K from round 1).
4. I still face no inflation, so my negotiating position remains strong.
5. While we risk getting nothing after 12 rounds, we still have 9 rounds left.
6. Since I face no inflation, I can afford to negotiate further for a better deal.

Given that I face no inflation penalty and her offer is actually worse than her first offer, I'll reject this and try to negotiate for a better split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a strategic offer that acknowledges Alice's inflation problem while securing a better position for myself:

{""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your inflation problem is real, and I'm offering a more favorable split for you at 55/45. This is better than continuing further rounds where your money loses more value. With your 20% per-round inflation, getting $550,000 now is worth much more than a larger number later. This is my best offer considering our different inflation situations.""}"
