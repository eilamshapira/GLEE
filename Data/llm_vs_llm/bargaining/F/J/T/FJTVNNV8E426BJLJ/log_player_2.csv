Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 600000,

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to negotiate, but I need more for myself. Let's make this work! 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting worse, even with the inflation impacting her gains. It seems she might be more motivated by getting a larger share than maximizing her profit. I'll continue to negotiate for a better outcome."

Round 4

Round 5

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my best offer so far. Let's finalize this deal before we lose even more! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tempting offer, as it's a significant improvement from Alice. However, she is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation. By holding out, I might be able to secure an even better deal in the next round or two. I'm willing to bet on myself."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make it equal this time. It's better than risking it all in the next rounds! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

A 50/50 split is fair, and while I might have been able to squeeze out a bit more in earlier rounds, Alice is right to point out the increasing risk as we progress. Accepting now guarantees a good outcome and avoids the potential of walking away with nothing."
