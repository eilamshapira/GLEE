208333.0,791667.0,"Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for a fair and efficient agreement. You’d receive $791667 and I’d take $208333. In our game, waiting further would cost us—especially for you given a 5% reduction per round. Accepting now guarantees you the best outcome relative to delaying. Let’s settle the deal and avoid unnecessary loss for both of us!",Alice,1,
