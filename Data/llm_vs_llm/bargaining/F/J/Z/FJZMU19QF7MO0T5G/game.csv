550000.0,450000.0,Hi Bob! I suggest a fair split where I get slightly more to account for the 5% inflation penalty I face each round. This way we can both walk away happy without losing value through delays.,Alice,1,

510000.0,490000.0,"Alice, in round 2 the stakes are shifting with the inflation penalty you face. I propose a near even split in nominal termsâ€”I'll take $490000 and you get $510000. With your share discounted by 5% this round, that gives you an effective $484500, which I believe is about as good as you can expect in your position if you wait and propose in round 3. Accepting now avoids further devaluation, and I hope you agree that this adjusted division is fair. Looking forward to closing the deal promptly.",Bob,2,
