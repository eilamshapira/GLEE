"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, in round 2 the stakes are shifting with the inflation penalty you face. I propose a near even split in nominal termsâ€”I'll take $490000 and you get $510000. With your share discounted by 5% this round, that gives you an effective $484500, which I believe is about as good as you can expect in your position if you wait and propose in round 3. Accepting now avoids further devaluation, and I hope you agree that this adjusted division is fair. Looking forward to closing the deal promptly. 
# Alice gain: 510000 
# Bob gain: 490000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's offer because:
1. With 5% inflation, my $510,000 is worth $484,500 effective value
2. If I reject and propose in round 3, my share would be worth even less due to 10% cumulative inflation
3. Bob made a reasonable adjustment considering the inflation penalty
4. Further negotiation rounds would only decrease my effective gains
5. This is a fair compromise that avoids the risk of both getting nothing if we run out of rounds"
