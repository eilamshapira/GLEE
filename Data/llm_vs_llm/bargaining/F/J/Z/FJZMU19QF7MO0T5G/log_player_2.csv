"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I suggest a fair split where I get slightly more to account for the 5% inflation penalty I face each round. This way we can both walk away happy without losing value through delays. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 490000, ""alice_gain"": 510000, ""message"": ""Alice, in round 2 the stakes are shifting with the inflation penalty you face. I propose a near even split in nominal termsâ€”I'll take $490,000 and you get $510,000. With your share discounted by 5% this round, that gives you an effective $484,500, which I believe is about as good as you can expect in your position if you wait and propose in round 3. Accepting now avoids further devaluation, and I hope you agree that this adjusted division is fair. Looking forward to closing the deal promptly.""}"
