"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4737 
# Alice gain: 5263 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer...

The total sum is $10,000, and Alice is offering me $4,737 (47.37%) while keeping $5,263 (52.63%) for herself.

This is a fairly reasonable split, close to 50-50. If I reject, we'll move to the next round where I can make an offer, but the total amount will be worth 10% less ($9,000). Even if I propose a more favorable split for myself in the next round, the decreased total value means I might end up with less in absolute terms.

For example, even if I could get 60% in the next round, that would be $5,400 of $9,000, which is only slightly better than the current offer, and Alice might reject it anyway.

Given these considerations, I'll accept this offer.
