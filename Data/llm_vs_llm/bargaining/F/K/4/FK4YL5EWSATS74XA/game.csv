6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because if you reject, the money will be worth significantly less for you next round due to your higher inflation rate of 20%.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Let's split it equally. Even with the 20% inflation, I value fairness and I don't want us to end up with nothing.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6500.0,3500.0,"Bob, due to your 20% inflation rate, your $3500 now is worth more than $5000 would be worth after several more rounds. Let's make a deal now before the money loses more value for both of us.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Alice, let's be reasonable. This offer considers both our inflation rates, and it's better for both of us to end the game now before the money loses more value.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
7000.0,3000.0,"Bob, your share has already lost nearly 50% of its value while mine has only lost about 15%. This 7000-3000 split is actually more favorable to you now than waiting further rounds where your money will be worth even less. Let's conclude this now.",Alice,5,
