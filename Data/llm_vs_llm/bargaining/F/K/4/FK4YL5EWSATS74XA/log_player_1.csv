"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because if you reject, the money will be worth significantly less for you next round due to your higher inflation rate of 20%.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it equally. Even with the 20% inflation, I value fairness and I don't want us to end up with nothing. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject because even with my lower 5% inflation rate, I can still offer a better deal in the next round that would benefit us both. Bob's 20% inflation rate means his share will decrease in value much faster than mine, giving me more negotiating power."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6500,
""bob_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Bob, due to your 20% inflation rate, your $3,500 now is worth more than $5,000 would be worth after several more rounds. Let's make a deal now before the money loses more value for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. This offer considers both our inflation rates, and it's better for both of us to end the game now before the money loses more value. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Even with the increasing inflation, I can still propose a better deal in the next round. Bob's much higher inflation rate (48.8% vs my 14.26%) means his negotiating position is weakening faster than mine, making it rational to continue negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7000,
""bob_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""Bob, your share has already lost nearly 50% of its value while mine has only lost about 15%. This 7000-3000 split is actually more favorable to you now than waiting further rounds where your money will be worth even less. Let's conclude this now.""}"
