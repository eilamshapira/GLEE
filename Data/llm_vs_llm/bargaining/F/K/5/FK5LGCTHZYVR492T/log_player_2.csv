"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it evenly, no need to wait 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice offers a 50-50 split ($500,000 each)
2. If I reject, I can make my own offer next round
3. However, inflation will reduce my money's value by 5% each round
4. $500,000 now is better than potentially getting more later due to inflation
5. It's a fair and reasonable first offer
