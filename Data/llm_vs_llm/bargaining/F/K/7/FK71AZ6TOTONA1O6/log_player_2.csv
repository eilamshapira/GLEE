"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer. She is proposing an even 50-50 split of the $100.

While this seems fair on the surface, I need to account for the inflation effect. If I reject this offer, the money will be worth 10% less to me in the next round. However, I'll get to make the next proposal.

Since this is the first round and the offer is perfectly equal, it's a reasonable starting point. If I reject, I might be able to get more in the next round, but I'll already be facing a 10% inflation penalty.
