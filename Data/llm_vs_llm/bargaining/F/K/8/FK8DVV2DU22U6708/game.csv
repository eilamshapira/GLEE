600000.0,400000.0,Let's split it fairly considering the inflation affects you more. This offer gives you a substantial amount while being fair to both of us.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but since I'm affected by a 10% inflation penalty each round while you aren't, a more equitable split would give me a bit more to compensate for this disadvantage. This offer still gives you a substantial amount while acknowledging the asymmetric inflation that impacts me.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"I understand your concern about inflation, but we both need to find a middle ground. This offer gives you a reasonable amount while considering the impact of inflation on you.",Alice,3,

420000.0,580000.0,"Alice, as we continue negotiating, my position weakens with each round due to the 27.1% inflation penalty I'm now facing. If I accepted your last offer of $450000, I'd only effectively receive $364500 after inflation. This adjusted offer accounts for the growing inflation impact while still giving you a substantial $420000 with no penalty. Let's try to reach an agreement soon before inflation erodes too much value for me.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Let's meet in the middle. This offer ensures both of us receive an equal share. Given the increasing impact of inflation on you, it's important we reach an agreement soon.",Alice,5,
