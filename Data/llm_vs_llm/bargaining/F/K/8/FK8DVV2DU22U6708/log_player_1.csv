Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but since I'm affected by a 10% inflation penalty each round while you aren't, a more equitable split would give me a bit more to compensate for this disadvantage. This offer still gives you a substantial amount while acknowledging the asymmetric inflation that impacts me. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, as we continue negotiating, my position weakens with each round due to the 27.1% inflation penalty I'm now facing. If I accepted your last offer of $450000, I'd only effectively receive $364500 after inflation. This adjusted offer accounts for the growing inflation impact while still giving you a substantial $420000 with no penalty. Let's try to reach an agreement soon before inflation erodes too much value for me. 
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000
