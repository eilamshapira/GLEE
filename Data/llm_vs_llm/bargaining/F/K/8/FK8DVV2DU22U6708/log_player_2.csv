"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly considering the inflation affects you more. This offer gives you a substantial amount while being fair to both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully given the 10% inflation penalty for each round.

Alice is offering me $400,000 out of $1,000,000. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, even if I were to get a better split, I'd be subject to 10% inflation on my portion.

For example, if I counter-offered a 50-50 split ($500,000 each) and Alice accepted, I'd actually receive $500,000 × 0.9 = $450,000 due to the 10% inflation penalty.

Given that Alice has no inflation penalty and the stakes of potentially getting nothing if we don't agree after 12 rounds, this initial offer of $400,000 isn't ideal but it's reasonable.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I need to make a fair counteroffer while factoring in the inflation penalty that affects me.

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but since I'm affected by a 10% inflation penalty each round while you aren't, a more equitable split would give me a bit more to compensate for this disadvantage. This offer still gives you a substantial amount while acknowledging the asymmetric inflation that impacts me.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concern about inflation, but we both need to find a middle ground. This offer gives you a reasonable amount while considering the impact of inflation on you. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate this offer considering the increasing inflation penalty that affects only me.

Alice has increased her offer to me from $400,000 to $450,000, which shows some willingness to compromise. At this point (round 3), I'm facing a 19% inflation penalty, which means if I accept this offer, I would effectively receive $450,000 × 0.81 = $364,500.

If I reject and we continue to later rounds, the inflation penalty will grow even larger, reducing my potential gains further. Additionally, there's the risk of getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement within 12 rounds.

Alice's offer has improved, but given the asymmetric inflation that only affects me, there's still room for a more equitable arrangement.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 580000,
""alice_gain"": 420000,
""message"": ""Alice, as we continue negotiating, my position weakens with each round due to the 27.1% inflation penalty I'm now facing. If I accepted your last offer of $450,000, I'd only effectively receive $364,500 after inflation. This adjusted offer accounts for the growing inflation impact while still giving you a substantial $420,000 with no penalty. Let's try to reach an agreement soon before inflation erodes too much value for me.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. This offer ensures both of us receive an equal share. Given the increasing impact of inflation on you, it's important we reach an agreement soon. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate this offer with the growing inflation penalty in mind.

Alice is now offering a 50-50 split ($500,000 each), which appears fair on the surface. However, with the current 34.39% inflation penalty affecting only me in round 5, my effective gain would be:
$500,000 × (1 - 0.3439) = $500,000 × 0.6561 = $328,050

If we continue to later rounds, my position will only worsen with increasing inflation. Given that:
1. Alice has improved her offer significantly (from $450,000 to $500,000)
2. We're now in round 5 of 12, with inflation penalties growing
3. We risk getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds
4. This is a standard 50-50 split which is typically considered fair

While I could try for more, the rapidly increasing inflation makes further negotiation increasingly risky for me.
