"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I need to propose a split of the $10,000, keeping in mind inflation will hurt Bob more than me. I want to start with a proposal that is somewhat favorable to me, but still reasonable enough for Bob to accept, given the dwindling value.

Here's my proposal:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

My reasoning: I am offering Bob $4000 in the first round. Given the inflation, this is a reasonable start. I am also aiming for a good starting point for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob has proposed a split of $4500 for me and $5500 for him.

Let's consider the implications of accepting versus rejecting. If I reject, the money will be worth less to both of us next round, but especially to Bob. If I accept, I get $4500.

Given that this is only round 2, and the money is still worth close to full value, I believe I can get a better offer from Bob in a later round, considering the increasing inflation for him. Also, I was aiming for at least $6000 for myself.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's my turn to make an offer again. Inflation is now starting to become a more significant factor for Bob. I will still aim for a favorable split for myself, but I need to increase Bob's share slightly to increase the chances of acceptance.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200
}
```

My reasoning: I've decreased my share slightly compared to round 1, and increased Bob's share, hoping he finds it more palatable given the inflation he is facing. I am still aiming for a majority share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob's offer is now $4200 for me and $5800 for him. The inflation for Bob is becoming significant.

Let's analyze:

*   **If I accept:** I get $4200.
*   **If I reject:** The value of money for Bob depreciates even further next round. He may be forced to offer me a better deal then.

While $4200 is not ideal, it's also not terrible, especially given Bob's situation. However, I believe I can still push for a better deal, given the asymmetric inflation.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's my turn again. Bob's inflation is making a difference now. I need to be strategic. I'll slightly increase Bob's share again, but still maintain a good portion for myself.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5600,
  ""bob_gain"": 4400
}
```

My reasoning: I'm hoping the combination of Bob's inflation and a slightly increased offer will make it more appealing. I am still holding out for a good portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob is offering me $4000 and taking $6000 for himself. His inflation is now quite significant at 22.62%.

Let's consider:

*   **If I accept:** I get $4000.
*   **If I reject:** Bob's loss next round will be even bigger.

While $4000 is lower than I was initially hoping for, the situation is changing. Bob is under increasing pressure due to inflation. However, six rounds are already over, and 6 more remain.

I will gamble that Bob will offer more next round, so I will reject.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, time to make another offer. Bob's inflation is a real problem for him now. I need to be mindful of that, but also try to secure a decent amount for myself.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5400,
  ""bob_gain"": 4600
}
```

My reasoning: I am still aiming for above $5000 for myself. Bob's inflation should make this offer tempting. If he rejects, his losses in the next round will be considerable. I am trying to capitalize on the asymmetric inflation dynamic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3800 
# Bob gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob's offer is now $3800 for me and $6200 for him. His inflation is a painful 30.17%. He's clearly trying to compensate for the losses he's already incurred.

Let's consider:

*   **If I accept:** I get $3800. That's lower than I'd like.
*   **If I reject:** Bob will lose even more value next round.

We're now past the halfway point (8 rounds completed out of 12). The risk of getting nothing is increasing. However, Bob's inflation is so high that I still believe I can get a better offer if I reject. I think Bob might be close to his breaking point.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Alright, round 9. Bob's inflation must be crippling him by now. It's time to press my advantage.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800
}
```

My reasoning: I'm slightly decreasing my share again, hoping that the combination of Bob's high inflation and a more generous offer will be enough to secure a deal. I still want to walk away with over half, but I recognize the increasing risk of reaching the deadline. This should be an offer he can't refuse!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3600 
# Bob gain: 6400 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob is offering me $3600 and taking $6400. His inflation is a massive 36.98%! We are in Round 10, only 2 rounds remain. The risk of getting nothing is becoming very real.

Let's analyze:

*   **If I accept:** I get $3600. This is quite low, but guaranteed.
*   **If I reject:** Bob's inflation will become even worse, but we risk losing everything. He also might get stubborn and offer me even less next turn.

This is a very tough decision. I think at this point, the risk of losing everything outweighs the potential gain of a slightly better offer next round. I will accept Bob's offer.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
