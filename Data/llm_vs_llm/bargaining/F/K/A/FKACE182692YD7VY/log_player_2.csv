"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The current offer gives me $400,000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, any money I get next round will be worth 5% less to me
4. If I reject, my $400,000 would effectively become worth $380,000 next round

While I could try to negotiate for more, the 5% inflation penalty means I'm taking a risk. Any delay reduces the real value of what I could get. Since $400,000 is a substantial amount (40% of the total), and considering the inflation penalty, I should accept this offer.
