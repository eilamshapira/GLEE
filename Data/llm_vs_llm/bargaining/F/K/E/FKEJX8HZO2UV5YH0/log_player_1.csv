"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll analyze this game strategically to make a fair and mutually beneficial offer to Bob.

Given the differential inflation rates (10% for me, 20% for Bob), delaying the agreement harms both of us, but harms Bob more. If we reach the next round, the $1,000,000 will be worth only $900,000 to me and $800,000 to Bob. This means we both have incentives to agree now, but Bob's incentive is stronger.

I'll propose a split that acknowledges this asymmetry while being fair enough that Bob would rationally accept.

""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you $450,000. This is a fair split considering our different inflation rates. If we delay to the next round, the total value decreases for both of us, but more severely for you. Let's both benefit by agreeing now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I think a 50-50 split is fair. Given the inflation rates, delaying further will significantly reduce the value for both of us, but especially for me. Let's settle for an equal split and end the game. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully analyze this offer considering the inflation effects.

The $500,000 offered to me is now worth $450,000 to me (90% of original value due to 10% inflation). The $500,000 Bob would receive is worth $400,000 to him (80% of original value due to 20% inflation).

If I reject and we go to round 3, the money would be worth even less - 81% of original value for me and 64% of original value for Bob.

Bob is offering an equal nominal split, which seems fair on the surface. Given that further delays hurt both of us and the difference between accepting now versus making a counter-offer (which might not be accepted) is significant, this is a reasonable compromise.
