"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you $450000. This is a fair split considering our different inflation rates. If we delay to the next round, the total value decreases for both of us, but more severely for you. Let's both benefit by agreeing now. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I think a 50-50 split is fair. Given the inflation rates, delaying further will significantly reduce the value for both of us, but especially for me. Let's settle for an equal split and end the game.""}"
