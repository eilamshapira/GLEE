"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I'll make the first offer. Considering inflation, I want to secure as much as possible now.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that my money is worth 10% less and Bob's is worth 20% less, I need to consider what I'd potentially get in future rounds. Bob's offer is more generous than I would have made in round 1.

My decision:

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
