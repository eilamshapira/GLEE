"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob considering the inflation factor that affects my gains in future rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 62, 
""bob_gain"": 38, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split considering the 20% inflation penalty I face each round. If we go to round 2, the $100 is only worth $80 to me, so this offer actually gives both of us more value than if we delay. I hope you'll accept so we can both walk away with a good deal today.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're facing inflation, but your initial offer was a bit too low for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  This offer is more balanced and ensures we both benefit from reaching an agreement now. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
