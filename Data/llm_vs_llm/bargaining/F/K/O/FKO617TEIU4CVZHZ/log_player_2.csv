"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split considering the 20% inflation penalty I face each round. If we go to round 2, the $100 is only worth $80 to me, so this offer actually gives both of us more value than if we delay. I hope you'll accept so we can both walk away with a good deal today. 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
