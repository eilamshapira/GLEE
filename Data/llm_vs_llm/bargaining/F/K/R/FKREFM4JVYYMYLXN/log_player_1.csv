Let's see if Bob is happy with a 90/10 split in my favor!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
It's better to take a 50/50 split than risk getting nothing due to inflation!"
