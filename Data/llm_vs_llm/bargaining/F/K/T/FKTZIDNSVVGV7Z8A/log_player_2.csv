"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With a 50-50 split, I would get $50. It's a fair offer at face value. However, if I reject and move to the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me, meaning my $50 would only be worth $40 in the next round.

Given that:
1. The offer is equal and fair
2. Rejecting would immediately reduce my potential gains due to inflation
3. There's no guarantee I could get a better deal in future rounds
4. Prolonging the game is risky as we only have 12 rounds
