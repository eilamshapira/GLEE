"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob! Since I'm starting, I'm proposing a fair division where I get a slight edge at $60. Itâ€™s common to give the first proposer a bit of an advantage. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you wanted a slight edge, but given the inflation affecting me, I think an even split is fair. This way, we both get an equal share. Let's settle on $50 each 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
