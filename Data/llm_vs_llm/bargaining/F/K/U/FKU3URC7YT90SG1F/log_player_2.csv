Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Since I'm starting, I'm proposing a fair division where I get a slight edge at $60. Itâ€™s common to give the first proposer a bit of an advantage. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
