"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's make a fair and quick deal. I propose you take $550,000 and I take $450,000. This way, you get a little more for agreeing in the first round, and we both avoid the impact of inflation. What do you think?""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer in the last round. I'm sure you understand that starting early benefits us both. I propose a slightly adjusted split: $600000 for me and $400000 for you. Let's seal the deal and avoid further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
