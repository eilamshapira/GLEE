"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the potential inflation. Let's settle this now. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Okay, let's calculate the adjusted values.

*   **My original gain's worth:** My initial gain of $1 is now worth $0.9 * $0.9 = $0.81.
*   **Bob's original gain's worth:** Bob's initial gain of $1 is now worth $0.8 * $0.8 = $0.64.

I need to make an offer that is enticing enough for Bob to accept, considering the diminishing value for both of us. I'll aim for a division that gives Bob a slightly larger share but still leaves me with a decent amount, adjusted for inflation.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5300,
  ""bob_gain"": 4700,
  ""message"": ""Bob, let's end this. I'm offering $5300 for me and $4700 for you. This considers the inflation impact on both of us. Accept this fair deal.""
}
