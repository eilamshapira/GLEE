Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. This offer is fair and ensures we both get a good share. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $450,000 I would gain is actually worth $450,000 * 0.64 = $288,000 in real value.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Due to inflation, the money I gain is worth 36% less in round 2 and another 20% less in round 3, so it's 0.64 * 0.8 = 0.512 of the original value. 
Considering this, I'll make a more generous offer to Alice.
