"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split this fairly, Bob! I think this is a good starting point for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000
2. If I reject, we go to the next round where:
   - I can make a counter-offer
   - But the money will be worth 5% less to me
   - Current value: $400,000
   - Next round value: $380,000 maximum

While the split isn't completely equal (60-40 in Alice's favor), accepting now guarantees me $400,000. If I reject, I risk losing value due to inflation, and Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to even more rounds and value loss.

The rational choice is to accept this offer, as the potential loss from inflation outweighs the potential gain from negotiating.
