4500.0,5500.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'd prefer a more balanced split. I'm proposing I get $5500 and you get $4500. I'm facing 20% inflation per round, which significantly impacts the value I receive. This split seems fair considering that factor. I hope we can agree and avoid further rounds where we both lose value.",Bob,2,
