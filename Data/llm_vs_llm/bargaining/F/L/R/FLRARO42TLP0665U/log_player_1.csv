Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000,""bob_gain"": 4000,""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's start with a fair division. I think a 60-40 split is reasonable for both of us. What do you say?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'd prefer a more balanced split. I'm proposing I get $5500 and you get $4500. I'm facing 20% inflation per round, which significantly impacts the value I receive. This split seems fair considering that factor. I hope we can agree and avoid further rounds where we both lose value. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
