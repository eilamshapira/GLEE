"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's start with a fair division. I think a 60-40 split is reasonable for both of us. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $4000 while she gets $6000. Since inflation reduces my money by 20% each round, waiting comes at a cost. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, my maximum potential value would already be reduced.

Let me analyze: If I reject and propose a 50-50 split next round, I'd get $5000 but with 20% inflation, that's worth $4000 to me - the same as accepting now. Any better split would be worth more, but Alice might reject it.

Given the inflation pressure and that this is just the first round, I'll reject and try for a better split.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split that accounts for the inflation I'm facing while still being fair to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'd prefer a more balanced split. I'm proposing I get $5500 and you get $4500. I'm facing 20% inflation per round, which significantly impacts the value I receive. This split seems fair considering that factor. I hope we can agree and avoid further rounds where we both lose value.""}"
