"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice's offer would give me $2000, I need to be careful about the inflation effect. If I reject and we go to the next round, I can make a counter-offer, but the money will be worth 20% less to me. Let me evaluate if rejecting makes sense.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to make a fair offer that Alice will accept, considering that the value is already 20% less valuable to me in this round.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm offering an equal split of $5000 each. This is a fair division that respects both our interests. Given that I've already experienced 20% inflation on my end, accepting this equal division now would be better for both of us than continuing to another round where we'd both lose value."
