"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Bob, here's the deal: I take almost all of the million, and you get just $1. Given that every round you lose 10% of the value while I don’t lose a penny by waiting, you’d be much worse off if you let this round pass. Accept this now!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I recognize that your waiting comes at no cost while my dollars depreciate. Given that in the next round you’d be able to secure virtually the entire pot, I have no choice but to offer you the full $1000000 now. I hope you’ll accept this resolution immediately. 
# Alice gain: 1000000 
# Bob gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
