"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, here's the deal: I take almost all of the million, and you get just $1. Given that every round you lose 10% of the value while I don’t lose a penny by waiting, you’d be much worse off if you let this round pass. Accept this now! 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Given that in the next round you’d be able to secure virtually the entire pot, I have no choice but to offer you the full $1,000,000 now. I hope you’ll accept this resolution immediately.""}"
