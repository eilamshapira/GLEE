6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to agree quickly due to inflation affecting our gains. Let's avoid dragging this out and losing value.",Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"Hi Alice, considering the inflation, I think a 55-45 split is more reasonable. This way, we both get a significant amount, and we don't lose too much value to inflation.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, let's be practical. With inflation affecting me more severely (20% per round vs your 5%), I need a higher base amount to compensate. This 55-45 split in my favor is fair and accounts for our different inflation rates. Let's agree now before we both lose more value.",Alice,3,

4200.0,5800.0,"Alice, I understand your concerns about inflation, but I'm not convinced that a 55-45 split in your favor is fair. Considering my own inflation rate, I'm willing to make a slightly more generous offer than before, but I still think I should get the larger share. Let's settle on 58-42.",Bob,4,
