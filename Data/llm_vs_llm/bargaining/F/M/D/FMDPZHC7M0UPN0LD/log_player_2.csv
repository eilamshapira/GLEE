"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to agree quickly due to inflation affecting our gains. Let's avoid dragging this out and losing value. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering the inflation, I think a 55-45 split is more reasonable. This way, we both get a significant amount, and we don't lose too much value to inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical. With inflation affecting me more severely (20% per round vs your 5%), I need a higher base amount to compensate. This 55-45 split in my favor is fair and accounts for our different inflation rates. Let's agree now before we both lose more value. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, 
""alice_gain"": 4200, 
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concerns about inflation, but I'm not convinced that a 55-45 split in your favor is fair. Considering my own inflation rate, I'm willing to make a slightly more generous offer than before, but I still think I should get the larger share. Let's settle on 58-42.""}"
