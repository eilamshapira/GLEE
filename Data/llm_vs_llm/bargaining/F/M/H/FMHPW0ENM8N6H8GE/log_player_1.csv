Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the different inflation rates affecting us, this is actually a fair split. You'll get 450000$ now, which is worth more than a larger amount in future rounds due to your 10% depreciation rate. Let's make a deal and both walk away with substantial amounts. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000
