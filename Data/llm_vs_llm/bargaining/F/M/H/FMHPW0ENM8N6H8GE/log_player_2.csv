"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split this fairly. I'm offering you a good chunk, more than enough to make you happy! We don't want to risk ending up with nothing, right? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for herself
2. If I reject, next round I can make an offer, but:
   - The money will be worth 5% less for me (I'd have 950,000$ to divide)
   - It will be worth 10% less for Alice (she'd value it at 900,000$)
3. This gives me some negotiating power in the next round, as Alice's position weakens faster than mine

While 400,000$ is a substantial amount, I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round, taking advantage of the differential inflation rates.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that Alice's money devalues faster than mine (10% vs 5% per round), I'll propose a more favorable split for me while still being reasonable enough for her to accept, considering she'll lose more value by waiting.

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Given the different inflation rates affecting us, this is actually a fair split. You'll get 450,000$ now, which is worth more than a larger amount in future rounds due to your 10% depreciation rate. Let's make a deal and both walk away with substantial amounts.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's try this again. I'm giving you almost half, and with my money depreciating faster, this is actually a good deal for you in the long run. Don't let pride get in the way of profit! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Due to inflation:
   - For me, 450,000$ is now worth about 406,125$ (9.75% less)
   - For Alice, 550,000$ is worth about 445,500$ (19% less)
2. If I reject:
   - Next round my money will be worth about 15% less than original
   - Alice's will be worth about 29% less than original
3. Alice has moved from her initial 400k offer to 450k, showing willingness to negotiate
4. The difference between our inflation rates is growing, giving me more leverage
5. However, we're already in round 3 of 12, and the total value is decreasing for both of us

While I could potentially get a better deal by continuing, the risk of further devaluation and potential deadlock is significant. This is a reasonable offer given the current depreciation, and Alice has shown good faith by improving her initial offer.
