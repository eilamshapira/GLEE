"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. The offer gives me $40 out of $100
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, in the next round the money will be worth less to me
4. $40 now vs. potentially more but worth 5% less next round
5. $40 is a reasonable offer, though not ideal

I will accept this offer because:
- It's a fair enough offer
- The risk of losing value due to inflation makes accepting now more attractive
- There's no guarantee Alice would accept a better offer from me in the next round
