60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we split it 60-40 in my favor. Given the inflation rates, this seems fair to start with. What do you think?",Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, since the money is devaluing faster for you (20% vs my 5% per round), we should reach an agreement soon. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor, which given the current inflation would actually give you $36 in real value (45 × 0.8) and me $52.25 (55 × 0.95). This is fairer than it might appear at first glance.",Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"Bob, since we're both losing value each round, let's try to find a middle ground. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor, which, considering inflation, would give me $35.20 (55 × 0.8 × 0.8) and you $39.83 (45 × 0.95 × 0.95). This is a fair compromise given the rapid devaluation on my side.",Alice,3,
