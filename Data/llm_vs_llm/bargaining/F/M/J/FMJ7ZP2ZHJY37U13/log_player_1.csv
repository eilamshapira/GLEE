Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since the money is devaluing faster for you (20% vs my 5% per round), we should reach an agreement soon. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor, which given the current inflation would actually give you $36 in real value (45 × 0.8) and me $52.25 (55 × 0.95). This is fairer than it might appear at first glance. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

  ""message"": ""Bob, since we're both losing value each round, let's try to find a middle ground. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor, which, considering inflation, would give me $35.20 (55 × 0.8 × 0.8) and you $39.83 (45 × 0.95 × 0.95). This is a fair compromise given the rapid devaluation on my side.""
