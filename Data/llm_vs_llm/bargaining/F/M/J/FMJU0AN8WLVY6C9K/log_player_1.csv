"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since Bob has the option to counter-offer.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000. This is a reasonable split that gives both of us a substantial amount while accounting for the possibility of future negotiations and inflation risk on my side."
