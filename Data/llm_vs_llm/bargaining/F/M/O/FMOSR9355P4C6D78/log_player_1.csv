Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My offer is more reasonable, considering the inflation rates. It's in your best interest to accept, as the money will be worth less in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. The value is dwindling fast, especially for you. This is my final offer, take it or leave it.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aware the value is decreasing, but I'm willing to take the risk. This offer is more balanced, and it's in your interest to accept before the value drops further for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

Taking the deal at this point is the best course of action. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  While Bob's offer isn't ideal, waiting any longer means the $100 will be worth even less. The rate of inflation hurts Bob more, but it still impacts my potential gains.
* **Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee Bob will offer me a better deal in subsequent rounds. He might become more desperate, but there's also a chance he'll lowball me further, hoping I'll crack under the pressure of inflation. 
* **Something is better than nothing:** Accepting $45 now is a safer bet than risking getting a worse deal later or potentially ending up with nothing if we can't reach an agreement."
