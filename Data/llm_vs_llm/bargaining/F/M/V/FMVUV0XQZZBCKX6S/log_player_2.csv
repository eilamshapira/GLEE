"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a fair 60-40 split in my favor. This gives you a solid $40 while ensuring we both benefit from a quick agreement. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me consider Alice's offer. She's suggesting I receive $40 while she gets $60.

If I reject and move to the next round, the money would be worth 5% less to me due to inflation. So my $40 would effectively become worth $38 (40 Ã— 0.95) in the next round.

If I make a counter-offer, Alice might accept or reject it. Given that she's already offering me a substantial portion and the inflation penalty will reduce my gain if we delay, accepting this offer seems reasonable.
