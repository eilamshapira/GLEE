"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a split that takes into account the inflation penalties we both face. Since Bob's inflation penalty (20%) is higher than mine (10%), he has more incentive to agree early.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in favor of myself. This is fair because:
1. As the first mover, I'm setting a reasonable baseline
2. Bob faces higher inflation penalties, so accepting now is in his interest
3. It's a clear majority for me while still giving Bob a substantial share"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Bob is offering a 50-50 split
2. Due to inflation:
   * My $500,000 is actually worth $450,000 (10% less)
   * Bob's $500,000 is worth $400,000 to him (20% less)
3. If I reject, I can make a new offer next round, but both our shares will be worth even less

While I'd prefer my initial 60-40 split, a 50-50 split in round 2 is still reasonable, and the inflation penalty makes waiting costlier. Getting $450,000 in value now is better than risking further depreciation.
