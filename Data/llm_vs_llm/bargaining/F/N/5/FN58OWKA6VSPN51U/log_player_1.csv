"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 3565.23, ""bob_gain"": 6434.77, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that I take $3565.23 and you get $6434.77. If you reject, you’ll get to make a proposal next round—but given that money for you depreciates by 5% each round while mine doesn’t, waiting will cost you. This division reflects our future bargaining power and ensures you get the best real value you could expect later. Let’s agree now and avoid unnecessary losses.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor.  Let's be reasonable. I propose a 66/34 split. This reflects that you benefit more from a delayed agreement.  Accept this offer to avoid further depreciation of our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 3334 
# Bob gain: 6666 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your proposal, but your offer gives me $3,334 in value right now. Given that I’ll be proposing in the next round and my money does not suffer any depreciation—whereas your share continues to erode—I believe I can secure a more favorable outcome by waiting. Therefore, I must respectfully reject your offer.""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 2950, ""bob_gain"": 7050, ""message"": ""Bob, I propose we settle now with a split of $2,950 for me and $7,050 for you. In round 3, your share is worth about 90% of its face value—about $6,345— which is slightly higher than what you’d effectively get if you waited until round 4 to propose your own division. This offer reflects the cost of further delay for you and provides an immediate, better value. Let's agree now to avoid additional depreciation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it's clear we both want to reach an agreement.  I'm proposing a 68/32 split. This factors in the time pressure from the depreciation, offering you a reasonable share while ensuring I don't lose out significantly.  Let's be pragmatic and close this deal. 
# Alice gain: 3200 
# Bob gain: 6800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate the effort in your proposal. However, I believe that by waiting until my turn to propose in Round 5, I can secure a more favorable division for myself given that my share isn’t subject to depreciation. Your offer of $3,200 for me doesn’t reflect the advantage I’ll have by proposing next round—especially as your money loses additional value with each passing round. I must thus reject this offer.""}"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 2700, ""bob_gain"": 7300, ""message"": ""Bob, here's my proposal for Round 5: I receive $2,700 and you receive $7,300 from the $10,000. With the current depreciation, your $7,300 is effectively worth about 0.95⁴ × 7300 ≈ $5,950. If you wait until Round 6, you'll be proposing, but your share will suffer further depreciation (dropping to roughly 0.95⁵ of whatever face value you secure), likely giving you less effective value. This offer aims to balance our positions and help you secure your best outcome without further delay. Let’s settle now before the losses add up.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're reaching a critical point.  My offer is a 69/31 split. This acknowledges the depreciation while still giving you a reasonable share. Holding out further significantly risks our potential gains. Let's be sensible and finalize this now. 
# Alice gain: 3100 
# Bob gain: 6900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort, but this offer still doesn’t give me enough value compared to what I can secure by proposing next round. Given that my share isn’t depreciated while yours will diminish further, I can get a better deal when it's my turn in Round 7. I must reject your offer.""}"

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 2510, ""bob_gain"": 7490, ""message"": ""Bob, here's my proposal for Round 7. I allocate $2,510 for myself and $7,490 for you. Remember that due to inflation, every round that passes further erodes the effective value of your share—in Round 7 your dollars are worth about 73.5% of their face value. In accepting this offer, you’d net roughly $7,490 × 0.735 ≈ $5,510 in effective terms. If you hold out for your own proposal in Round 8, the extra delay will force an even lower multiplier on your share, likely reducing your effective payoff further. I believe this division fairly reflects the cost of delay and our respective positions. Let's agree now and avoid additional losses.""}"
