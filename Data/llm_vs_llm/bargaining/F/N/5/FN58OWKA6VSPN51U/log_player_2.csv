"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I take $3565.23 and you get $6434.77. If you reject, you’ll get to make a proposal next round—but given that money for you depreciates by 5% each round while mine doesn’t, waiting will cost you. This division reflects our future bargaining power and ensures you get the best real value you could expect later. Let’s agree now and avoid unnecessary losses. 
# Bob gain: 6434.77 
# Alice gain: 3565.23

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6666, ""alice_gain"": 3334, ""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor.  Let's be reasonable. I propose a 66/34 split. This reflects that you benefit more from a delayed agreement.  Accept this offer to avoid further depreciation of our potential gains.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I propose we settle now with a split of $2950 for me and $7050 for you. In round 3, your share is worth about 90% of its face value—about $6345— which is slightly higher than what you’d effectively get if you waited until round 4 to propose your own division. This offer reflects the cost of further delay for you and provides an immediate, better value. Let's agree now to avoid additional depreciation. 
# Bob gain: 7050 
# Alice gain: 2950

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6800, ""alice_gain"": 3200, ""message"": ""Alice, it's clear we both want to reach an agreement.  I'm proposing a 68/32 split. This factors in the time pressure from the depreciation, offering you a reasonable share while ensuring I don't lose out significantly.  Let's be pragmatic and close this deal.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, here's my proposal for Round 5: I receive $2700 and you receive $7300 from the $10000. With the current depreciation, your $7300 is effectively worth about 0.95⁴ × 7300 ≈ $5950. If you wait until Round 6, you'll be proposing, but your share will suffer further depreciation (dropping to roughly 0.95⁵ of whatever face value you secure), likely giving you less effective value. This offer aims to balance our positions and help you secure your best outcome without further delay. Let’s settle now before the losses add up. 
# Bob gain: 7300 
# Alice gain: 2700

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6900, ""alice_gain"": 3100, ""message"": ""Alice, we're reaching a critical point.  My offer is a 69/31 split. This acknowledges the depreciation while still giving you a reasonable share. Holding out further significantly risks our potential gains. Let's be sensible and finalize this now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, here's my proposal for Round 7. I allocate $2510 for myself and $7490 for you. Remember that due to inflation, every round that passes further erodes the effective value of your share—in Round 7 your dollars are worth about 73.5% of their face value. In accepting this offer, you’d net roughly $7490 × 0.735 ≈ $5510 in effective terms. If you hold out for your own proposal in Round 8, the extra delay will force an even lower multiplier on your share, likely reducing your effective payoff further. I believe this division fairly reflects the cost of delay and our respective positions. Let's agree now and avoid additional losses. 
# Bob gain: 7490 
# Alice gain: 2510
