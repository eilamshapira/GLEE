"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair split to start. Let's end this quickly! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice is offering me $40, while she gets $60. Given the 20% inflation effect on each round, if I reject and we go to the next round, the total value will be reduced. Let me consider this carefully.

If I reject, I'll make an offer in the next round, but the $100 will be worth only $80 to me due to inflation. Even if I were to get all $80, that's still less than what I'd get by accepting $40 now (since $40 > $80 Ã— 0.5).
