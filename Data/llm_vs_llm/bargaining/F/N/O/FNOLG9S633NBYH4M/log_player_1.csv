"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Remembering the inflation, and that this is round 3, I need to make an offer that's more appealing to Bob while still netting me something worthwhile. Since he rejected 60/40 and then offered 45/55, he seems to be aiming for a more equal split. Given the inflation, I'll try offering him a slightly better deal, hoping he'll accept rather than risk further loss of value.
