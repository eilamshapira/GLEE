"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","For the first round, I'll make a reasonable offer. Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob with each passing round, it's in both of our interests to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. Considering this, I'll propose a split that slightly favors me but is still attractive enough for Bob to consider accepting, given the potential loss of value in subsequent rounds.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, the actual value I'd receive from Bob's offer would be 500,000 * 0.9 = 450,000.

Considering Bob's offer of an equal split, which is now valued at 450,000 for me due to inflation, and taking into account that the value will continue to decrease with each round, I think this is a reasonable offer.
