"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a fair offer to Bob, considering the inflation effect on my end.

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 50-50 split which is perfectly fair. Since the money loses value for me each round (20% inflation), it makes sense to agree quickly. This even split respects both of our interests.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. Since you mentioned you face 20% inflation while I face 10%, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This is reasonable because: 1) You seem more affected by delays than I am, so settling quickly benefits you more, and 2) If we go back and forth, we both lose value. Let's agree now and both walk away with a good deal rather than risk further depreciation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your point about inflation, but your conclusion was incorrect. Because I face higher inflation (20% per round vs your 10%), I should actually get a larger share to compensate for this disadvantage. At this point, my money has already lost 20% of its value while yours only lost 10%. A 55-45 split in my favor is fair given this difference in inflation rates. Let's agree now before we both lose more value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but your reasoning isn't economically sound. Higher inflation doesn't entitle you to more money - it actually increases your incentive to settle quickly. Since we're already in round 4, the $100 is worth significantly less to both of us (27% less for me, 48% less for you). Let's be practical - this 55-45 split favoring me is fair because: 1) I have more negotiating leverage as I can afford to wait longer with my lower inflation rate, and 2) further delays will hurt your position more than mine. If we continue, we both lose, but you lose faster. This is a reasonable compromise given our circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, 
""bob_gain"": 48, 
""message"": ""Bob, I acknowledge your point about negotiating leverage. Let's be practical and find a middle ground. At this point, we're both losing value - me faster than you, yes, but we're both still losing. I'm meeting you closer to the middle with a 52-48 split slightly in my favor. This compensates somewhat for my higher inflation rate while recognizing your stronger waiting position. Further delays hurt us both substantially - I've already lost nearly 50% of value and you've lost over 27%. Let's not continue this downward spiral. This offer is reasonable and allows us both to walk away with a fair outcome given our different inflation rates.""}"
