5500.0,4500.0,"Hi Bob, since I'm facing 20% inflation per round, I'm proposing a slight advantage for me. This is quite fair as waiting would significantly reduce the value for me. If we proceed to the next round, I'll only get 80% of the value, which would force me to ask for more to compensate.",Alice,1,
