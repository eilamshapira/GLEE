"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, since I'm facing 20% inflation per round, I'm proposing a slight advantage for me. This is quite fair as waiting would significantly reduce the value for me. If we proceed to the next round, I'll only get 80% of the value, which would force me to ask for more to compensate. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Current offer: $4,500 for me, $5,500 for Alice
2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make an offer
   * My money will be worth 5% less
   * Maximum I could get would be worth: $10,000 * 0.95 = $9,500 equivalent value

Alice claims she has 20% inflation, which could be true or a negotiation tactic. However, even if true, her high inflation rate means she has more incentive to settle now.

$4,500 now is better than risking a negotiation where the total value decreases. If I reject, I'd need to secure significantly more than $4,737 ($4,500/0.95) in the next round just to break even.
