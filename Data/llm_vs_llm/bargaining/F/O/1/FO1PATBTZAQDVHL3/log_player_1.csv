"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make my first offer. Since Bob has a higher inflation rate than I do (10% vs. 5%), I should be strategic about this.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest we split the money with me getting $55 and you getting $45. This is close to an even split, but gives me a slight advantage. Given that we both face inflation with each round, it makes sense to reach an agreement soon rather than delaying."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I notice we're both proposing similar divisions but with our own advantage. Let me try a slightly more balanced approach since the inflation is affecting both of us and Bob's inflation rate is higher than mine.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose an even 50-50 split. This is a fair division that gives us both equal amounts. Since you face a higher inflation rate (10% per round compared to my 5%), this deal is becoming less valuable for you more quickly than for me. Let's agree now and both walk away with a fair amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","I see we're still not finding common ground. Let me adjust my offer considering that we're already in round 5 and both of us are losing value due to inflation, with Bob losing value faster.

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}

I propose I get $45 and you get $55. This gives you a majority of the money while still being fair to me. Given that we're already facing significant inflation (I've lost 14.26% value and you've lost 27.1%), it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon rather than continue negotiating and losing more value."
