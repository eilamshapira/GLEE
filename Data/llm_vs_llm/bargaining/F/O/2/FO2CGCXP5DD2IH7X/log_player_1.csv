"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a division that takes into account Bob's time pressure due to the 20% inflation penalty per round. Since I don't face inflation penalties, I can use this to my advantage, but I should still make the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept rather than risk losing value.

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

I propose this division because:
1. It gives Bob a significant portion ($300,000) which is better than risking 20% loss if he declines
2. If Bob declines, his next offer would need to account for the fact that I could decline and he'd lose another 20% in the following round
3. It's a clear enough advantage for me while still being potentially acceptable to Bob"
