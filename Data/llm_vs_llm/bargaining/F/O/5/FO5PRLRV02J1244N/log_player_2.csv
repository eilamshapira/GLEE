"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice is offering me $3,000 out of $10,000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 10% inflation, the money will be worth less to me next round
4. $3,000 now vs. potentially more money but worth 10% less next round

Since this is early in the game and the offer is quite low (only 30% of the total), I'll reject and make a counter-offer next round. Even with the 10% inflation penalty, I should be able to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer, considering that:
1. I need to make it attractive enough for Alice to accept
2. If she rejects, she can counter-offer next round
3. Her next counter-offer would be worth another 10% less to me
4. A fair split would incentivize acceptance

I'll propose a 60-40 split in my favor:

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

This is a reasonable offer that gives Alice a substantial portion while still being advantageous to me. If she rejects, I'll lose 10% value in the next round, but she might also be motivated to accept since it's a fair improvement from her initial low-ball offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Alice is offering me $3,500, but due to 19% inflation, it's actually worth $2,835 to me
2. If I reject, I can make another offer next round
3. However, the next round will have 27.1% inflation for me (compounding 10% more)
4. Alice has only slightly improved her offer from the first round ($3,000 → $3,500)

The inflation is starting to significantly impact my potential gains, and continuing to reject might leave me with even less effective value. However, $2,835 in real value is still quite low compared to a fair split. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal even with the inflation penalty.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given the increasing inflation pressure (money is now worth 27.1% less to me if Alice rejects), I need to make a compelling offer that Alice is likely to accept. I'll adjust my previous offer to be more attractive to Alice while still maintaining a reasonable outcome for myself:

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

This is a more moderate split than my previous 60-40 offer. My reasoning is:
1. If Alice rejects this, my next potential gain will be significantly eroded by inflation
2. The offer gives Alice a good portion (45%) while still leaving me with a decent amount
3. It's a clear improvement for Alice compared to my previous offer
4. It's reasonable enough that she should prefer accepting now rather than continuing negotiations

I'm hoping this balanced approach will lead to an agreement and prevent further value erosion from inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation carefully:

1. Alice is offering me $3,800, but with 34.39% inflation, it's actually worth only $2,493 to me
2. If I reject and go to the next round:
   * Inflation will increase to about 41% for me
   * I can make another offer, but Alice has shown she's willing to wait
   * My negotiating position is weakening significantly due to inflation

The trend shows that:
* Alice is making small incremental increases ($3000 → $3500 → $3800)
* My real value is rapidly decreasing due to inflation
* Alice has no inflation pressure, so she can afford to wait

At this point, continuing to negotiate is likely to result in an even worse outcome for me due to the compounding inflation. While $2,493 in real value isn't great, it's better than risking further deterioration of value.
