"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $40 while she gets $60 out of the $100. If I reject this offer, I'll get to make a proposal in the next round, but due to inflation, the money will be worth 20% less to me (so the $100 would effectively be worth $80 to me).

If I reject and move to the next round, I could propose a better split for myself, but I'd be working with money that's worth less to me. Even if I proposed to take all $100 in the next round, it would only be worth $80 to me because of inflation.

Since $40 now is better than potentially getting even $80 that's worth only $64 to me after inflation, I'll accept this offer.
