"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my first offer to divide the $10,000, keeping in mind that with each passing round, the money loses 20% of its value for me and 10% for Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I suggest this division as a fair starting point, giving you a slight advantage to reflect the fact that I'm making the first move, but also acknowledging that we both need to come to an agreement quickly due to the inflation penalties."
