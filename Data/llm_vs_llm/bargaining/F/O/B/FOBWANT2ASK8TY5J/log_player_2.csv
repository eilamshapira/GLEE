"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $4,500 while she gets $5,500 of the $10,000.

If I reject and we move to the next round, the total value decreases. For me, the money would be worth 10% less, meaning the $10,000 becomes worth $9,000 to me. For Alice, it decreases by 20%, making it worth $8,000 to her.

If I counter-offer in the next round, I could potentially get more than $4,500, but we'd be dividing a pie that's effectively smaller for both of us.

The current offer gives me 45% of the total. While not perfectly equal, it's a substantial amount, and rejecting would reduce the total value for both of us.
