"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm proposing an even 50-50 split, which I think is fair for both of us. Remember that with each round, inflation reduces the value by 5% for me, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
