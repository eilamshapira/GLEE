"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's start with a fair split. This gives us both a good amount to start with. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice's offer gives me a reasonable amount, I need to consider the inflation factor. If I reject now and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value will decrease by 5%. Since this is the first round, I should try to negotiate for a more balanced split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm proposing an even 50-50 split, which I think is fair for both of us. Remember that with each round, inflation reduces the value by 5% for me, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon.""}"
