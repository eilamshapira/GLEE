"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I need to make a fair initial offer to Bob, considering the 5% inflation penalty I face for each round delay. I should aim for a reasonable split that Bob is likely to accept early on.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""I'm proposing a fair split that slightly favors me as the first mover. If we delay too long, I'll suffer from inflation, reducing the total value we can both enjoy. Let's make a deal now and both walk away with substantial amounts.""}"
