"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm proposing a fair split that slightly favors me as the first mover. If we delay too long, I'll suffer from inflation, reducing the total value we can both enjoy. Let's make a deal now and both walk away with substantial amounts. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $4,500 (45%) while taking $5,500 (55%)
2. If I reject, we move to next round where:
   * I can make an offer
   * But my money will be worth 20% less (so $4,500 now > $5,000 next round)
3. Alice makes a reasonable point about avoiding inflation losses
4. This is a decent first offer - slightly favoring her but not greedy

While I could reject and try to negotiate for more, the inflation penalty makes early agreement valuable. $4,500 now is better than a potentially larger nominal amount later.
