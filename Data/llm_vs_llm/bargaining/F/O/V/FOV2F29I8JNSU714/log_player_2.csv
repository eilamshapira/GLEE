"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer seems quite skewed in her favor, offering me only 30$ out of 100$. Given that inflation reduces the value by 10% each round for me (but not for Alice), I need to consider if rejecting might lead to a better outcome.

If I reject and propose in the next round, the total value for me would be reduced to 90$ (due to 10% inflation). However, I could propose a more favorable split for myself.

I'll reject this offer to seek a more equitable distribution.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a more balanced split, considering that inflation affects me but not Alice, and trying to find a fair middle ground.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'm proposing this split because it's more equitable than Alice's initial offer. I understand we both want to maximize our gains, but a fair distribution would acknowledge both our interests. Since I'm facing a 10% penalty per round due to inflation and Alice isn't, it's in my interest to reach an agreement soon. This offer gives Alice a substantial portion while allowing me to receive a fair share as well."
