"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
- Alice is offering me $40 out of $100
- If I reject, we move to next round where I can make a counter-offer
- However, due to 10% inflation, $100 will be worth $90 in the next round
- My $40 now would be worth more than $45 (50% of $90) in the next round
- We have many rounds left, but inflation makes waiting costly
- This is a reasonable first offer, giving me 40% of the pot
