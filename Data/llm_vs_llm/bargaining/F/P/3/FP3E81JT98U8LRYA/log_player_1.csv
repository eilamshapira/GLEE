"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

Let's start with an even split. This is a fair offer and it would be good to set a cooperative tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer would give me $4750, but with the 10% inflation, it's only worth $4275 to me now. I can probably do better in the next round, even with further inflation. Let's see what he offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

Considering the inflation, this will be worth 4950 to me, and 4275 to Bob, which is comparable to the previous offer but a slightly better deal for me. It's still fair, given the inflation impact on Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4550 
# Bob gain: 5450 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

With the inflation, Bob's offer is worth about $4000 to me now. If I reject this offer, the next round will be worth 36.4% less to me, or $3835 if I were to secure the full $10000. So, this is the best deal I'm going to get. I should accept this offer."
