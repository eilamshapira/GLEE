Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 4500

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Before making an offer, I want to calculate the real value of the money for both players.

For me, the money is now worth 90.25% of its original value (95% of 95%).
For Alice, the money is now worth 81% of its original value (90% of 90%).

To make an attractive offer, I should consider the decreased value of the money for Alice.
