Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair.  We can both get a good amount, and I'm willing to negotiate further if you'd like. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
