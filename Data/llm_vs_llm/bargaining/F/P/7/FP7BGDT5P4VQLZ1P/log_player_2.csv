Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's try this. I'll take 55, and you get 45. It's still a good deal for both of us, and it's better than letting the money get further devalued! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
