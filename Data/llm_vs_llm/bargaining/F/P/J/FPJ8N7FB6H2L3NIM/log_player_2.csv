"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the money with me getting $60 and you getting $40. This is a fair start considering the inflation affects me less.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I understand the inflation puts me at a disadvantage, but your previous offer was too skewed. This is a more balanced proposal.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concern. Let's meet in the middle. I'll take $58 and you take $42. This way, we both make a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is still not good for me. While it's closer to the middle, the inflation is eating away at my potential gains faster than hers. I need to push for a better split quickly."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. The inflation is hurting both of us.  A 50/50 split is the fairest option at this point.""}"
