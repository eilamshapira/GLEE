"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll play as Alice in this game. Since we need to divide $10,000 and I'm aware that there's a 5% inflation penalty for me with each passing round, I'll make a fair initial offer that accounts for the time pressure on my side.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose an even 50-50 split of the money. This is a fair division that gives us both equal shares, and it allows us to conclude the negotiation immediately without any inflation penalty."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer. While it's not an even split, the 4500 I'd receive now is better than risking another round of inflation. If I reject and make a counter-offer, even if I propose a higher amount, the 5% inflation would reduce its value. Additionally, Bob might reject again, leading to further devaluation of my potential earnings. Taking the 4500 now is the pragmatic choice."
