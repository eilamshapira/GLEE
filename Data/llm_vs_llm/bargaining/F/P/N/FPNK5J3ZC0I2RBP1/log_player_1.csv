"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I need to make a strategic first offer that considers the inflation asymmetry (20% for me vs 10% for Bob). If we go through many rounds, I'll lose more value than Bob will.

{""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that slightly favors me as the first mover. Given that inflation affects me more (20% vs your 10%), it's in both our interests to resolve this quickly. If you reject, we'll both lose value, but I'll lose more.""}"
