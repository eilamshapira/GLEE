"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a division that takes into account that Bob's money loses value each round, while mine doesn't. This gives me some leverage, but I still want to make a reasonable offer to avoid too many rounds of negotiation.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose this split because it's a fair starting point that gives Bob a significant portion while acknowledging my stronger position due to the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Bob offers me $45 and keeps $55
2. Due to inflation, Bob's $55 is actually worth $49.5 to him (90% of $55)
3. My $45 is still worth full value
4. If I reject, we move to round 3 where I can make another offer, but Bob's money will be worth even less (80% of original value)
5. This gives me more leverage in the next round, and since I don't lose value to inflation, I can afford to negotiate further

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Now that we're in round 3, Bob's money is worth only 80% of its original value. I'll adjust my offer accordingly, but still try to be reasonable enough that Bob might accept:

{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}

This offer means Bob would get $35, which is worth $28 to him due to the 20% inflation at this round. While this is less nominal money than my previous offer, I need to increase my share to account for Bob's weakening position due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
1. Bob offers a 50-50 split
2. Due to inflation, Bob's $50 is actually worth $36.45 to him (72.9% of $50)
3. My $50 maintains full value
4. If I reject, we move to round 5 where I can make another offer, and Bob's money will be worth even less
5. This offer is still lower than what I proposed in round 3
6. Given that I have the stronger position due to inflation protection, I can likely get a better deal

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Now in round 5, Bob's money is worth only 63.7% of its original value (after 37.3% inflation). I'll leverage this position while still trying to make an offer that Bob might accept to avoid further rounds:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

With this offer, Bob would get $30, which is actually worth about $19.11 to him due to the inflation at this round. While this might seem aggressive, it reflects the reality of the diminishing value of Bob's share over time, and we should try to reach an agreement before his position weakens further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
1. Bob offers me $55 and keeps $45
2. Due to inflation, Bob's $45 is actually worth only $26.57 to him (59.05% of $45)
3. My $55 maintains full value
4. If I reject, we move to round 7 where I can make another offer, and Bob's money will be worth even less
5. Given that my previous offer was for $70, and I'm still in the stronger position due to inflation protection, this offer isn't attractive enough

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","In round 7, Bob's money is worth only 54.86% of its original value (after 45.14% inflation). His position is significantly weaker now, and we need to reach an agreement before we risk running out of rounds:

{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}

With this offer, Bob would get $25, which is actually worth about $13.72 to him due to the current inflation level. While this is a more aggressive offer than before, it reflects both my stronger negotiating position and the urgency to reach an agreement before Bob's share loses even more value or we risk getting nothing by running out of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
1. Bob offers me $60 and keeps $40
2. Due to inflation, Bob's $40 is actually worth only $19.13 to him (47.83% of $40)
3. My $60 maintains full value
4. We have only 4 rounds left before both of us get nothing
5. While I'm still in a stronger position, the risk of running out of rounds is becoming significant
6. This offer is better than Bob's previous ones, and the $60 is a respectable amount

Given the remaining rounds and the risk of getting nothing, I'll accept this offer.
