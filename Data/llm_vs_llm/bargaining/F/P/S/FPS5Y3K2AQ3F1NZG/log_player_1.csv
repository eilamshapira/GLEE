"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a fair 50-50 split. This is equitable for both of us, and we can avoid further depreciation of the money. Let's be reasonable and finish this now. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
