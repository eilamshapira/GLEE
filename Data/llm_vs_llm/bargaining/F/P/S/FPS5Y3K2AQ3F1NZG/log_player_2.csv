"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split this fairly. I get 70%, you get 30%. Take it or leave it, the pie shrinks each round! 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $300,000, while taking $700,000 for herself
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 5% less to me next round
3. The split is quite unfavorable (70-30)
4. However, Alice makes a valid point about the pie shrinking each round
5. If I reject, in the next round, the total value to me would be $950,000, from which I could offer a better split

Given that this is just the first round and the split is quite unfair, I'll reject this offer. I can propose a more equitable split next round, and even with the 5% depreciation, I should be able to get a better outcome.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split while acknowledging the time pressure we both face:

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. This is equitable for both of us, and we can avoid further depreciation of the money. Let's be reasonable and finish this now.""}

Reasoning:
1. A 50-50 split is fair and more likely to be accepted
2. Even though I'm facing 5% depreciation per round, starting with an extreme counter-offer might lead to too many rounds of negotiation
3. If Alice accepts, I get $500,000, which is significantly better than the $300,000 initially offered
4. The message emphasizes fairness and mutual benefit
5. Highlighting the depreciation factor encourages Alice to accept rather than continue negotiating"
