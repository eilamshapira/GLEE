"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a fair initial offer to Bob, keeping in mind that inflation affects me by 10% each round.

{""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""I'm proposing an equal split of the money. This is fair for both of us, and we can avoid inflation losses by resolving this now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want an even split, but I'm taking a bigger risk going into round 2. I need a little more to make it worthwhile for me. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether accepting Bob's offer makes sense compared to continuing to negotiate.

If I accept now:
- I get $4000, but it's worth 10% less due to inflation, so effectively $3600
- Bob gets $6000, worth 5% less to him, so effectively $5700 for him

If I reject and propose in round 3, my money would be worth another 10% less. The division would need to be substantially in my favor to make rejection worthwhile.
