"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Let's keep in mind that with each round, the money loses 10% value for me due to inflation, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly.

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand we both want to reach an agreement quickly due to inflation. Let's meet in the middle with a 55-45 split in my favor. This is a fair compromise from both our initial positions, and it's better for both of us to agree now rather than lose more value to inflation.
