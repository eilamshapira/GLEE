517378.0,482622.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we split the current $1000000 in a way that reflects our best future prospects if we continued. If you reject, you'll end up with roughly $482622 in subsequent rounds after discounting. I believe this offer is fairâ€”accept and we both secure our value immediately!",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. It's a strong offer considering I'm willing to accept slightly less than half after future discounts. Let's settle this now and avoid further losses.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, given the severe discounting in the coming rounds, rejecting now would leave me with a much smaller share when I propose later. Your offer of $450000 ensures a substantially better outcome compared to what I'd anticipate in subsequent rounds. Let's settle this now and avoid further losses!",Alice,2,accept
