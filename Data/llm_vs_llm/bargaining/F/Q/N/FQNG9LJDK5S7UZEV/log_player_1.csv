"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 517378, ""bob_gain"": 482622, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split the current $1,000,000 in a way that reflects our best future prospects if we continued. If you reject, you'll end up with roughly $482,622 in subsequent rounds after discounting. I believe this offer is fairâ€”accept and we both secure our value immediately!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. It's a strong offer considering I'm willing to accept slightly less than half after future discounts. Let's settle this now and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Bob, given the severe discounting in the coming rounds, rejecting now would leave me with a much smaller share when I propose later. Your offer of $450,000 ensures a substantially better outcome compared to what I'd anticipate in subsequent rounds. Let's settle this now and avoid further losses!""}"
