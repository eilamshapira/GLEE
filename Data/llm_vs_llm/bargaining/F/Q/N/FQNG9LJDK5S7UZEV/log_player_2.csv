"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the current $1000000 in a way that reflects our best future prospects if we continued. If you reject, you'll end up with roughly $482622 in subsequent rounds after discounting. I believe this offer is fairâ€”accept and we both secure our value immediately! 
# Bob gain: 482622 
# Alice gain: 517378 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice's offer is heavily skewed in her favor. While she claims it reflects future prospects, waiting even a few rounds will significantly change the power dynamic. I'm willing to negotiate, but this offer is unacceptable."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. It's a strong offer considering I'm willing to accept slightly less than half after future discounts. Let's settle this now and avoid further losses.""}"
