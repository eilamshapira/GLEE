"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me evaluate this offer.

Alice is proposing that I (Bob) get $400,000 and she gets $600,000 out of the total $1,000,000.

While this isn't an even split, it's a substantial amount of money. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but there's no guarantee Alice will accept my counter-offer.

Given that $400,000 is a significant sum, I'll make my decision.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair counter-offer to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose we split the money equally, with each of us receiving $500,000. This is the fairest division possible and would allow us both to benefit equally from the available funds."
