"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's make this fair: $600000 to me and $400000 to you. This ensures you get a significant amount and we conclude the game quickly without losing value to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $400,000 out of $1,000,000 (40%)
2. If I reject and move to the next round:
   - The total value will be worth 5% less to me
   - I can make a counter-offer
   - But Alice might reject, leading to more rounds and more inflation

$400,000 now is better than potentially getting more in later rounds with inflation:
- Next round the $1M would be worth $950,000 to me
- Even if I got a better split then, I might end up with less in real value
- There's also risk of multiple rounds of rejection

This is a reasonable first offer that gives me a significant sum without risking inflation losses.
