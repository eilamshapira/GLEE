"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's start with a fair offer. I propose we split the $100 with me taking $55 and you taking $45. This gives me a slight edge, but it's a good starting point considering the declining value of the money with each round. Let's avoid unnecessary rounds and take this deal.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, I think we can both do better.  I'm proposing a 51/49 split in my favor, as I'm taking the lead in the negotiation.  Let's get this done in the second round! 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
