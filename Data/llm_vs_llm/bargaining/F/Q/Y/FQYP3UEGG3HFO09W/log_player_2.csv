"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's start with a fair offer. I propose we split the $100 with me taking $55 and you taking $45. This gives me a slight edge, but it's a good starting point considering the declining value of the money with each round. Let's avoid unnecessary rounds and take this deal. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
