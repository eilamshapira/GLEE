"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 0 
# Alice gain: 1000000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me after the first round, the actual amount I'm dividing is $900,000 (10% less than $1,000,000). I'll make a proposal to get a significant share. 

{""bob_gain"": 540000, 
""alice_gain"": 460000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 19% less for me, I need to consider the actual value I'd be getting. However, Alice's offer is extremely low. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the money is worth 19% less for me after the first two rounds (10% + 9.1% (10% of 900,000 is 90,000, 10% of 910,000 is 91,000, but the actual decrease is 10% of 1,000,000 = 100,000 and then 10% of 900,000 = 90,000, so total decrease is 190,000, which is 19% of 1,000,000)), and now another 10% decrease for this round, making it a total of 28.71% (1 - 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.19, and 1 - 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.2871) decrease, I'll aim for a more favorable split.

However, I should calculate the actual amount after the decrease: 
1,000,000 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 729,000.

I'll make an offer that seems reasonable, keeping in mind the decreased value for me.

{""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""alice_gain"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","Another extremely low offer from Alice. Considering the money is worth 34.39% less for me, I'd be getting only about 65.61% of the face value. However, Alice's offer of $1 is still not acceptable.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the money being worth 34.39% less for me after the first four rounds, and now another 10% decrease for this round, making it a total of 41.59% (1 - 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.4159) decrease, I'll aim for a more favorable split.

However, I should calculate the actual amount after the decrease: 
1,000,000 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 656,100.

I'll make an offer that seems reasonable, keeping in mind the decreased value for me.
