"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

- Alice is proposing a 50/50 split: $5,000 for me (Bob) and $5,000 for Alice
- If I reject, we go to the next round where I make an offer
- However, inflation will reduce the value by 10% for me and 20% for Alice
- This means in the next round, the $10,000 would be worth $9,000 to me and $8,000 to Alice

While I could make a counter-offer that gives me slightly more in the next round, a 50/50 split is fair, and rejecting risks further rounds of negotiation where both of us lose value. The offer is reasonable.
