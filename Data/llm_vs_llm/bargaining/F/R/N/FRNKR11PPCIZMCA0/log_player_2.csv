"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, in round 2, I'll propose a more equitable split, factoring in the potential for further losses due to inflation if we delay.

```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000
}
```

My reasoning is that this gives me a slight edge, while still being palatable enough for Alice to accept, considering the dwindling value of the money with each round. I'm hoping she'll see the benefit of securing a significant portion now rather than risking further losses."
