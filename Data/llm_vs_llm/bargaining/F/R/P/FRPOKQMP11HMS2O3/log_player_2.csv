"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation given that I initiated the offer. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if this is a fair division, taking into account the inflation penalty of 20% per round. If I reject and make a counter-offer, the total amount will decrease to 800,000$.

Alice is offering me 40% (400,000$) of the current 1,000,000$ pool. If I reject and counter with a 50/50 split next round, I'd be offering Alice 400,000$ (50% of 800,000$) and keeping 400,000$ for myself. That wouldn't improve my position.

Given that we face 20% inflation per round and have a limited number of rounds, accepting 400,000$ now is better than risking further reductions through continued negotiation.
