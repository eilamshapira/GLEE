"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a reasonable offer, considering potential future inflation if negotiations extend:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose $60 for me and $40 for Bob. This is a fair starting offer that gives both of us a substantial portion, while accounting for the fact that I face 20% inflation per round if we need to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer since getting $40 with 20% inflation means I'll effectively receive $32, which is quite low. I'll make a new proposal in the next round, though I need to be careful since the inflation penalty will continue to accumulate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since we're now in round 3, my gain will be worth 40% less than in round 1, so I need to adjust my offer accordingly to maintain a reasonable effective value:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I propose $70 for me and $30 for Bob. This higher amount for me helps compensate for the 40% inflation I'm experiencing, as my $70 will effectively be worth $42 after inflation. This still leaves Bob with a meaningful amount while protecting my interests against the increasing inflation penalty."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this 50-50 split because with the increasing inflation, further negotiations will significantly reduce my effective gains. With the current 48.8% inflation, my $50 will be worth approximately $25.60, which isn't great but is better than risking additional rounds where inflation will continue to erode the value. Also, we're already in round 4, and with only 12 rounds total, we need to reach an agreement before both of us end up with nothing."
