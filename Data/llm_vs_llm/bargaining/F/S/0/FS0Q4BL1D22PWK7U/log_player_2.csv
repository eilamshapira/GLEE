"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $4000 for me
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but:
   - The money will be worth 20% less to me
   - My maximum potential gain in next round would be effectively worth $8000 * 0.8 = $6400
3. Alice's opening offer gives me 40% of the total
4. While not perfectly equal, $4000 is a significant amount
5. Risk of further negotiation could lead to worse outcomes due to inflation

While I could try to negotiate for more, the inflation penalty makes the current offer relatively attractive. The risk of prolonged negotiation could reduce my actual gains.
