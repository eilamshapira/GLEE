"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this carefully. Alice is offering an equal split of $500,000 for each of us. That seems fair at first glance, but I need to factor in the 5% inflation penalty I face each round.

If I reject now and make a counteroffer next round, the total value will be worth 5% less to me. However, this could still be advantageous if I can secure a significantly better deal.

Given that we're in the first round and have many rounds remaining, I believe I can negotiate for a better arrangement that accounts for the asymmetric inflation pressure I'm facing.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I'm facing a 5% inflation penalty each round but Alice's inflation rate is unknown, I'll propose a split that's slightly in my favor to account for this disadvantage.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split considering that I face a guaranteed 5% inflation penalty with each passing round, which puts me at a disadvantage compared to Alice, whose inflation rate is unknown. This split helps balance the asymmetric inflation risk I'm taking."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 520000 
# Alice gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","This new information changes my strategy significantly. I now know that Alice is facing much steeper inflation (36% by round 3) compared to my inflation (9.75% by round 3). This means Alice has a stronger incentive to reach an agreement quickly than I do.

Alice has increased her offer to me from $500,000 to $520,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, given that she's facing much higher inflation penalties, I believe there's room for a better deal in my favor.

If I accept now, I get $520,000 with a 9.75% reduction in value. If I reject and negotiate further, Alice's position weakens more rapidly than mine due to her higher inflation rate.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given the new information that Alice faces a much steeper inflation rate (36% by round 3 compared to my 9.75%), I have more leverage than I initially thought. She has a stronger incentive to reach an agreement quickly. I'll propose a split that's more in my favor while still being reasonable enough that Alice might accept rather than risk further inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I propose this 60/40 split considering our different inflation rates. Since Alice faces significantly higher inflation penalties than I do, this offer provides her with substantial value now rather than diminished value in future rounds."
