"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a slightly higher amount for myself because inflation affects me more (20% vs your 10%). This division is actually fair when accounting for future value - if we keep negotiating, both of us lose more money with each round, but I lose more than you do. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
