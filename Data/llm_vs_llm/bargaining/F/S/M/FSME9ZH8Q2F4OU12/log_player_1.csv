"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me make a fair first offer that accounts for potential future inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split because while an even 50-50 split might seem fairest, I need to account for the 5% inflation penalty per round if Bob declines. By asking for slightly more now (55%), I protect myself against potential value loss while still making an attractive offer to Bob. The offer is reasonable enough that Bob should seriously consider accepting it rather than moving to another round where the total value decreases."
