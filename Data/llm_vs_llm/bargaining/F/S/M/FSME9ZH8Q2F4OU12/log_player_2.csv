"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Alice's offer carefully. She's offering me $4,500 while taking $5,500 for herself. 

If I reject this offer, we'll move to the next round where I can make a counter-proposal. However, due to the 10% inflation per round that affects me, the total value will be worth less to me in the next round.

Let me calculate: If I reject now, the $10,000 will effectively be worth $9,000 to me in the next round. This means even if I managed to get a larger percentage in round 2, the actual value might be less than $4,500 now.

Since this is a reasonable first offer (45% for me) and considering the inflation penalty, I'll accept.
