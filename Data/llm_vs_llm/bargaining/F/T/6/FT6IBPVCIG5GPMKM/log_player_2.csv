"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Looking at Alice's offer, I need to consider if it's fair and whether waiting for a better deal would be advantageous.

She's offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000, which is 40% of the total.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the money will be worth 10% less to me and 20% less to Alice. That means we'd effectively be dividing $900,000 from my perspective and $800,000 from Alice's perspective.

Since Alice is facing a steeper depreciation rate (20% vs my 10%), I have some leverage to negotiate for a better deal. I believe I can propose a more favorable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that takes into account our different inflation rates while still being reasonable enough for Alice to accept.

Since Alice faces a higher depreciation rate (20% per round vs. my 10%), she has more incentive to reach an agreement sooner. If we go to round 3, the $1,000,000 would be worth only $810,000 to me and $640,000 to Alice.

Given this dynamic, I'll propose a more balanced split that's still advantageous to me:

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000}

I believe this is fair because it gives me a majority share while still offering Alice a substantial amount. If she rejects, she risks losing more value due to her higher depreciation rate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's new offer considering the inflation that has occurred.

From the initial $1,000,000:
- For me (Bob), the money is now worth 19% less, so the effective total is $810,000 from my perspective
- For Alice, the money is worth 36% less, so the effective total is $640,000 from her perspective

Alice is offering me $460,000, which is 46% of the nominal amount. This represents about 56.8% of the current effective value from my perspective ($460,000/$810,000).

If I reject and we go to round 4, we'd face even more inflation (approximately 27.1% for me and 48.8% for Alice from the original amount), further reducing the pie's value for both of us.

Given that Alice has improved her offer significantly from the first round (from $400,000 to $460,000), and considering the accelerating inflation, this is a reasonable compromise.
