"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully given the inflation factor. If I reject, I'll get to make a counter-offer in round 2, but the total value will be worth 20% less to me (effectively $8,000 from my perspective). 

Alice's current offer gives me $4,000. If I reject, I could propose a higher amount for myself in round 2, but even if I asked for the full $10,000, it would only be worth $8,000 to me due to the 20% inflation. And Alice might reject my counter-offer anyway, leading to further rounds and more inflation.

Since $4,000 now is better than potentially getting nothing or a depreciated amount later, I'll accept this offer.
