"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair initial offer, considering we both want to maximize our gains but need to reach an agreement. Since I'm first, I'll propose a slight advantage for myself but keep it reasonable to increase chances of acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

This is a fair split where I get slightly more than half, acknowledging my first-mover position while still offering Bob a substantial portion. The relatively even split shows good faith and encourages cooperation."
