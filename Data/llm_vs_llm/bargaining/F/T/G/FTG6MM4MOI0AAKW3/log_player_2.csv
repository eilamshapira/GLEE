"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me $4,500 (45%) while taking $5,500 (55%). This is a reasonable first offer, but not quite fair.
If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round. However:
1. The money will be worth 10% less to me next round
2. Alice's money will be worth 20% less to her next round
3. If I offer something too greedy, Alice may reject and the cycle continues with further devaluation

Given these factors, while $4,500 is slightly less than half, it's actually a pretty solid offer considering the devaluation risks. Making a counter-offer would mean dealing with a smaller effective total, and Alice might be less likely to accept.
