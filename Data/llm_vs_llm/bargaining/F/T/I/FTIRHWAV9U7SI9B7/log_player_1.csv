"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split while considering that future rounds will reduce my gains due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this 60-40 split in my favor because I know I'm affected by 20% inflation each round, while Bob's inflation rate is unknown to me. This offer gives Bob a substantial portion while protecting my interests against inflation if negotiations continue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. My $550,000 with 20% inflation is worth $440,000 in round 1 value
2. This is less than what I offered in round 1 ($600,000)
3. We still have 10 rounds left, but each round my money will be worth 20% less
4. If I reject, in the next round my money will be worth another 20% less
5. It's a reasonable offer given the inflation pressure, and the risk of getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds
