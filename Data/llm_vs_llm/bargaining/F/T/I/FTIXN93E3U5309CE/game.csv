800000.0,200000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose that I take $800000 and you take $200000. Considering the inflation effect for me, this is a reasonable offer. Let's close the deal quickly.",Alice,1,

480000.0,520000.0,"Alice, I propose that you receive $480000 while I take $520000. Given the 5% discount I face with each round, this split reflects a fair balance between urgency and equity. Let's close the deal now to avoid further delay.",Bob,2,

640000.0,360000.0,"Bob, let's try to find a middle ground. I'll take $640000 and you can have $360000. With inflation impacting us both, this seems like a fair and balanced division. Let's finalize it this round!",Alice,3,

660000.0,340000.0,"Alice, given that another round only deepens our losses – my share would shrink to about 85.74% of its original value and your funds, as you mentioned earlier, lose even more – I propose a split where you receive $660000 and I get $340000. With this offer, you’d secure an effective value of roughly $422400 (if your funds remain at a 36% reduction from round 1), which is an improvement over your previous alternative. Let’s finalize this now to avoid further erosion.",Bob,4,
