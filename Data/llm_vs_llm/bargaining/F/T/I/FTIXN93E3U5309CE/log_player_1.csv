Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose that you receive $480000 while I take $520000. Given the 5% discount I face with each round, this split reflects a fair balance between urgency and equity. Let's close the deal now to avoid further delay.

# Bob gain: 520000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, given that another round only deepens our losses – my share would shrink to about 85.74% of its original value and your funds, as you mentioned earlier, lose even more – I propose a split where you receive $660000 and I get $340000. With this offer, you’d secure an effective value of roughly $422400 (if your funds remain at a 36% reduction from round 1), which is an improvement over your previous alternative. Let’s finalize this now to avoid further erosion. 
# Alice gain: 660000 
# Bob gain: 340000
