"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I take $800000 and you take $200000. Considering the inflation effect for me, this is a reasonable offer. Let's close the deal quickly. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Alice, I propose that you receive $480,000 while I take $520,000. Given the 5% discount I face with each round, this split reflects a fair balance between urgency and equity. Let's close the deal now to avoid further delay.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's try to find a middle ground. I'll take $640000 and you can have $360000. With inflation impacting us both, this seems like a fair and balanced division. Let's finalize it this round! 
# Bob gain: 360000 
# Alice gain: 640000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 340000, ""alice_gain"": 660000, ""message"": ""Alice, given that another round only deepens our losses – my share would shrink to about 85.74% of its original value and your funds, as you mentioned earlier, lose even more – I propose a split where you receive $660,000 and I get $340,000. With this offer, you’d secure an effective value of roughly $422,400 (if your funds remain at a 36% reduction from round 1), which is an improvement over your previous alternative. Let’s finalize this now to avoid further erosion.""}"
