"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal for Round 1. Given the fact that every delay costs me 10% per round and youâ€™re not affected by inflation, I know that if we move to the next rounds you will be in an even stronger position. So, in the interest of avoiding further delay, I propose that you take the entire $10000 while I take nothing. I understand that if you reject, you'll soon be the proposer and secure virtually the same outcome. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
