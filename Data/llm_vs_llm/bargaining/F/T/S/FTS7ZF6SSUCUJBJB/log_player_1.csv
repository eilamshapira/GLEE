"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, if we look ahead, any delay costs us both—especially me with a steeper devaluation. In light of our respective discount rates and the prospect of you proposing next round, this split (I get $21; you get $79) reflects our fair continuation values. Let’s settle now before further losses occur. 
# Alice gain: 79 
# Bob gain: 21 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
