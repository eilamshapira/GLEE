Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 21, ""alice_gain"": 79, ""message"": ""Alice, if we look ahead, any delay costs us both—especially me with a steeper devaluation. In light of our respective discount rates and the prospect of you proposing next round, this split (I get $21; you get $79) reflects our fair continuation values. Let’s settle now before further losses occur.""}"
