714286.0,285714.0,"Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $714286 while you get $285714. Given that each waiting round devalues money—10% for me and 20% for you—this split reflects our future bargaining positions. Accept now to secure your share before further loss in value.",Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,"Hi Alice, considering the rapid devaluation of money for both of us, I propose a split of $600000 for me and $400000 for you. This offer is more balanced than your previous one and takes into account the higher rate of devaluation on my side. Let's settle this now before our shares lose even more value.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob. I appreciate your effort to account for the inflation, but I'll pass on your Round 2 split. By rejecting your proposal, I can make a counter‐offer in Round 3 which (given the dynamic discounting) should secure me a better effective value. Looking forward to continuing our negotiation.",Alice,2,reject
333333.0,666667.0,"Hi Bob, considering our discounting rates—my money loses 10% per round while yours suffers 20%—waiting any longer will significantly erode our effective shares. In round 4, if you become the proposer, even a full take of the nominal million would only be worth about $400000 for you after discounting. To avoid that loss, I propose a split where I take $333333 and you take $666667. This gives you an effective value of roughly $400000 right now, which is about as good as your best alternative if you reject. I believe this deal fairly reflects our future bargaining positions under the inflation and ensures we’re both better off settling today. What do you say?",Alice,3,
