"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 714286, ""bob_gain"": 285714, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $714,286 while you get $285,714. Given that each waiting round devalues money—10% for me and 20% for you—this split reflects our future bargaining positions. Accept now to secure your share before further loss in value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the rapid devaluation of money for both of us, I propose a split of $600000 for me and $400000 for you. This offer is more balanced than your previous one and takes into account the higher rate of devaluation on my side. Let's settle this now before our shares lose even more value. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob. I appreciate your effort to account for the inflation, but I'll pass on your Round 2 split. By rejecting your proposal, I can make a counter‐offer in Round 3 which (given the dynamic discounting) should secure me a better effective value. Looking forward to continuing our negotiation.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 333333, ""bob_gain"": 666667, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, considering our discounting rates—my money loses 10% per round while yours suffers 20%—waiting any longer will significantly erode our effective shares. In round 4, if you become the proposer, even a full take of the nominal million would only be worth about $400,000 for you after discounting. To avoid that loss, I propose a split where I take $333,333 and you take $666,667. This gives you an effective value of roughly $400,000 right now, which is about as good as your best alternative if you reject. I believe this deal fairly reflects our future bargaining positions under the inflation and ensures we’re both better off settling today. What do you say?""}"
