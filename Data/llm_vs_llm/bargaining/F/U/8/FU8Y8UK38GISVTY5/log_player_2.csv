"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $714286 while you get $285714. Given that each waiting round devalues money—10% for me and 20% for you—this split reflects our future bargaining positions. Accept now to secure your share before further loss in value. 
# Bob gain: 285714 
# Alice gain: 714286

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering the rapid devaluation of money for both of us, I propose a split of $600,000 for me and $400,000 for you. This offer is more balanced than your previous one and takes into account the higher rate of devaluation on my side. Let's settle this now before our shares lose even more value.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, considering our discounting rates—my money loses 10% per round while yours suffers 20%—waiting any longer will significantly erode our effective shares. In round 4, if you become the proposer, even a full take of the nominal million would only be worth about $400000 for you after discounting. To avoid that loss, I propose a split where I take $333333 and you take $666667. This gives you an effective value of roughly $400000 right now, which is about as good as your best alternative if you reject. I believe this deal fairly reflects our future bargaining positions under the inflation and ensures we’re both better off settling today. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 666667 
# Alice gain: 333333
