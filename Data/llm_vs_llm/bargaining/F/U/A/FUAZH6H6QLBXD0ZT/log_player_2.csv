Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice's offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, but it's still tilted in her favor, especially considering the impact of inflation on my end. I need to signal that I'm willing to wait for a better deal."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation hurts us both, 56-44 is a fair middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is getting ridiculous. While Alice is right that inflation hurts us both, it's clearly impacting me more. Accepting this offer at Round 5 would mean losing a significant chunk of the initial value due to the repeated inflation hits.  I need to push for a more favorable split, even if it means risking a few more rounds."
