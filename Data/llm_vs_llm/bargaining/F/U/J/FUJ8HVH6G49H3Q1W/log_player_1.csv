"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. A 50/50 split is the fairest option.  We both lose out if this drags on due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
