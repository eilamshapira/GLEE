Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55,""bob_gain"": 45,""message"": ""I propose we split the money 55 to me and 45 to you. It's a fair start!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50-50 split is fair for both of us. If we continue to the next round, we both lose value due to inflation - you lose 5% and I lose 10%. This even split maximizes our combined value. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
