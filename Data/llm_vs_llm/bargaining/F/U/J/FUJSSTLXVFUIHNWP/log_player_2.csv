"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the money 55 to me and 45 to you. It's a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $45 while she gets $55. If I reject and we go to the next round, I'll make the proposal but the money will be worth 10% less to me and 5% less to Alice due to inflation.

If I reject, the $100 will effectively be worth $90 to me and $95 to Alice in the next round. This means I would need to propose a split where I get more than $45 worth of current value to make rejection worthwhile.

Given the inflation rates, Alice's offer of $45 to me now is not bad, but I believe I can get a better outcome by making my own proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll analyze this situation carefully. Since I rejected Alice's offer, I now get to make a counteroffer.

The inflation means that for me, the $100 is now worth $90, and for Alice, it's worth $95.

I need to make an offer that Alice will accept, considering that if she rejects, we'll go to round 3 where the money will be worth even less to both of us (81% of original value for me, 90.25% for Alice). Alice should accept any offer that gives her more than what she expects to get in the future rounds.

I'll propose a slightly more balanced split:

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""I think a 50-50 split is fair for both of us. If we continue to the next round, we both lose value due to inflation - you lose 5% and I lose 10%. This even split maximizes our combined value.""}"
