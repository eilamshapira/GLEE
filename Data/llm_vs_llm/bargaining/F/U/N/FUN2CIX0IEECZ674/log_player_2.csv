"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to think about this. Alice is offering me $200,000 out of the $1,000,000, keeping $800,000 for herself. That's a 20-80 split.

If I reject, I'll get to make a counter-offer in the next round, but the inflation means the total value to me would be worth 20% less, so we'd effectively be dividing $800,000 from my perspective. If I were to get all of it (which is unlikely), that would be $800,000.

Given that I have the option to counter-offer and there are 12 rounds total, I think I can negotiate for a better deal, even accounting for inflation.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I should propose a more balanced split, but one that accounts for the fact that I face inflation while Alice may not have the same constraint.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing an equal split of the money - 50% for each of us. This is fair and gives us both significant value. If we continue to negotiate, my potential gain decreases with each round due to inflation, so it makes sense to reach an agreement sooner rather than later."
