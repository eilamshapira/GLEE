"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's settle this quickly before any inflation bites us. I propose $55 for me and $45 for you—a fair split that lets us both walk away without delay. What do you say?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, $50 each. This way, neither of us feels shortchanged, and we can avoid further inflation risks. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your proposal. Considering the inflation effects—my share would be worth 10% less and yours 20% less in each subsequent round—it's in both our interests to settle now. I'm in favor of an even split as proposed, so I accept your offer.""}"
