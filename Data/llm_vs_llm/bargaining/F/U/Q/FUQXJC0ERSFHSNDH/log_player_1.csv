"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $600,000 and giving Bob $400,000, with a message suggesting that this is a fair starting point. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: How about a 52/48 split?  It's closer to even and accounts for the fact that I'm taking on some risk by passing on your initial offer. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I need to consider that when evaluating Bob's offer.

To calculate the actual value of Bob's offer to me, I'll multiply the offered amount by 0.9 (since it's worth 10% less):

$520,000 * 0.9 = $468,000

Considering this, I think I can try to get a better deal. Bob's offer doesn't seem significantly more favorable than my initial proposal, especially given the inflation penalty I'm facing.

My response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 20% less than the original amount (10% less in Round 2 and another 10% less in Round 3).

To calculate the actual value, I'll multiply the amount by 0.8 (since it's worth 20% less):

Let's say I offer myself $550,000. The actual value to me would be:

$550,000 * 0.8 = $440,000

And Bob's share would be:

$1,000,000 - $550,000 = $450,000

However, since the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than the original amount (5% less in Round 2 and another 5% less in Round 3), his actual share would be:

$450,000 * 0.9 = $405,000 (but this is not my concern, I'm just calculating my own share)

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's settle this, 55/45 seems reasonable considering the circumstances.""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more generous split than before, hoping to find a mutually acceptable agreement."
