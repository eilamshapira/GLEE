"Round 1
Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 480000,
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""How about a 52/48 split?  It's closer to even and accounts for the fact that I'm taking on some risk by passing on your initial offer.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's settle this, 55/45 seems reasonable considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

While not ideal, accepting a 45/55 split in round 3 is better than risking further inflation and a worse offer from Alice in subsequent rounds."
