"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer would give me $4,000 out of the $10,000 total. If I reject and move to the next round, the money would be worth 10% less to me due to inflation. Let me evaluate this offer.

If I reject, I'll make a counter-offer next round, but the total value to me would only be $9,000 (10% less). Even if I proposed a better split for myself in the next round, I'm already losing value due to inflation.

$4,000 now is better than potentially getting a larger percentage of a smaller pie. The offer is not a 50-50 split, but it's reasonable enough given the inflation penalty I face.
