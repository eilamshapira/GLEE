"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

* Alice is offering me $40 while keeping $60 for herself
* If I reject, we move to next round where:
  - Money value drops 20% for me (each $1 becomes $0.80)
  - Money value drops 10% for Alice (each $1 becomes $0.90)
  - I get to make the next offer

If I reject and make an offer next round:
* My $40 would be worth $32 (after 20% loss)
* Even if I propose a better split for myself, the value will be reduced
* The loss in value might outweigh potential gains from negotiating

Given the significant value loss per round and that $40 is a reasonable offer (even if not perfectly equal), I'll accept.
