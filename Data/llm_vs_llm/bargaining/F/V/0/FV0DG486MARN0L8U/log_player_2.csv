Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's be reasonable. This is a 50/50 split. Let's end this now. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The 50/50 split is fair, and since I'm not affected by inflation while Alice is, this is a good deal for both of us. Alice's share is actually worth less to her now due to the 19% inflation on her side, while my $50 maintains its full value."
