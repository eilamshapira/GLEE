Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I suggest a fair 50-50 split. This is equitable for both of us, and we can both walk away happy with a significant amount. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
