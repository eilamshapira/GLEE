It's getting late in the game, but this offer is still too low.  I'm hoping Alice will start to feel the pressure and offer a larger share soon."

I'm increasing my offer slightly to signal I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm holding firm on getting a larger share.  The inflation is making every round more critical."

This is getting too close for comfort.  While it's closer to a fair split, I think I can still get Alice to agree to a slightly better deal for me."

I'm going back to my previous offer. With the increasing inflation, Alice might find this more appealing now than in a couple of rounds."

Finally!  This is much closer to my desired split and with inflation eating away at the value, it's better to take this deal now than risk getting even less later."
