"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering the inflation impact affects you more than me, so you should act quickly.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 45-55 split in my favor. Considering the inflation impact, I believe this is a fair offer. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Bob's offer gives me $550,000
2. Due to 5% inflation, this is effectively worth $522,500 to me
3. If I reject and we go to next round:
   - Further 5% inflation will apply
   - I could propose again, but Bob would likely reject again
   - The back-and-forth would reduce value for both of us
   - Bob's inflation is higher (10%), so he has more incentive to settle

Given that:
- I'm getting more than half of the nominal amount
- The effective value is still significant
- Further delays will only decrease value for both of us
- This is a reasonable compromise from Bob's initial rejection
