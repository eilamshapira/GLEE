"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share, let's end early 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is proposing I get $4000 while she gets $6000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the total amount will be worth 5% less
3. While the split isn't equal (40/60), rejecting means we'll be dividing $9,500 instead of $10,000
4. Making a counter-offer might lead to further rejections and more value loss

Although the split isn't perfectly equal, accepting now preserves the total value, and $4000 is still a substantial amount. Getting into a back-and-forth negotiation could leave us both worse off.
