"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair here. I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, considering that time works against you due to the 10% devaluation. This is a reasonable offer that gives you $400000 right now instead of less value in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
