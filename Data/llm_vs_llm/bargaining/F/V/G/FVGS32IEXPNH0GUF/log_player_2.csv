"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Take $1000 and call it a day. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I can propose a much fairer split in the next round, and since Alice faces a 10% devaluation per round while I don't, I have more negotiating power."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair here. I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, considering that time works against you due to the 10% devaluation. This is a reasonable offer that gives you $400,000 right now instead of less value in future rounds.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Let's split it 45/55 in my favor. This is a fair compromise given the devaluation. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a reasonable compromise. While I could potentially negotiate for more, the offer of $550,000 is substantial, and continuing to negotiate carries the risk of a less favorable outcome. Given that Alice is offering a relatively fair split despite her money devaluing, I'll accept this proposal."
