"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Split it evenly, fair for both""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A bit more for me, but you still get a substantial amount. Let's settle this round to avoid further inflation on your side. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept this offer, I'll get $400,000, but it's worth 10% less than its original value. So, the actual value I'll get is $400,000 * 0.9 = $360,000.

Since Bob's offer doesn't seem very favorable to me, I'll reject it and try to make a better offer in the next round.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less to me now (10% less in Round 2 and another 10% less in Round 3), I'll try to make an offer that's more favorable to me.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Last chance for a fair deal, don't let inflation eat away my share""
}
```"
