"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's start with a fair offer. I get a little more because I'm making the first offer, but it's still a good deal for you considering inflation. Let's take it and both win! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if this offer makes sense for me.

Alice is offering me $45 while taking $55. While this isn't a 50-50 split, I need to consider the inflation factors.

If I reject and we move to the next round, the money will be worth 10% less to me (so the $100 becomes worth $90 to me). Meanwhile, for Alice, it would be worth 5% less (so $95 to her).

If I make a counter-offer in the next round, Alice could reject, leading to further inflation. Given the asymmetric inflation rates, delaying generally favors Alice.

$45 now is better than potentially getting less later due to the higher inflation rate affecting me more severely.
