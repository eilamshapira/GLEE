"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share to make this worthwhile for me. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is worse than my previous offer, even considering the inflation. I need to hold firm for a better deal."
