"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this... 

Alice has offered a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance. However, I need to consider that if I reject and move to the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation.

If I reject:
- In round 2, the $10,000 would only be worth $8,000 to me
- I would get to make the next proposal
- But Alice might reject my offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation

A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. Getting $5,000 now is better than risking getting less later due to inflation.
