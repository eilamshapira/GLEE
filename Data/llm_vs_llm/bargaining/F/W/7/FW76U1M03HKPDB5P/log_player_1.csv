"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's split it 45/55. A fairer split, considering the money is losing value fast! 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While it's slightly reduced in value due to inflation, getting 55$ (worth about 44$ after inflation) is still better than risking another round where the money would lose even more value. This is a fair compromise."
