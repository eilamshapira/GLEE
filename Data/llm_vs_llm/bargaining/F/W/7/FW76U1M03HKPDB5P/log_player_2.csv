"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, as I'm making the first move and taking initiative in our negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the game and the stakes. I need to consider the inflation factor with each round.

Right now, Alice is offering me $40. If I reject, the total value will decrease by 20% and I will have to make an offer.

Let's analyze: If I reject, the total pot shrinks to $80. Let's assume I can propose a split that gives me at least $50 (before inflation) in the next round. $50 is more than $40.

Therefore, I should reject.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Okay, it's my turn. Remember, the $100 is now effectively worth $80 due to the 20% reduction. I need to make an offer that Alice is likely to accept, but also maximizes my gain. I'll propose a slightly more balanced split, favoring myself, but not too aggressively.

```json
{
""bob_gain"": 45,
""alice_gain"": 55,
""message"": ""Alice, let's split it 45/55. A fairer split, considering the money is losing value fast!""
}
