"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first move and taking initiative in these negotiations.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm offering a 55-45 split in my favor. It's a fair compromise, and we can both move on from this negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

My reasoning: This is a reasonable offer that's close to a 50-50 split. While I might prefer more, rejecting this could lead to further rounds where the total amount could be reduced due to time value of money, or Bob might make a less favorable offer. A 45-55 split is within the range of fair outcomes, so I'll accept it and conclude the negotiation."
