"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer that considers the time pressure due to inflation affecting me.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I suggest this split because it gives you a substantial portion ($450,000) while acknowledging that I need to secure a slightly higher amount to offset the 10% inflation penalty I'll face if we move to another round. This is a fair offer that allows us both to walk away with significant value without risking further devaluation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to be strategic since the money is already worth 20% less to me than in the first round.

{""alice_gain"": 510000, ""bob_gain"": 490000}

I'm offering you a more generous split than my initial proposal. This gives you $490,000 which is a very fair portion, while still allowing me to get enough to offset some of the inflation penalty I'm facing. If we continue to another round, the money will be worth even less to me, so this represents a good compromise that benefits us both."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to be more strategic now that the money is worth 34.39% less to me than in the first round.

{""alice_gain"": 480000, ""bob_gain"": 520000}

I'm revising my offer to give you a majority share of $520,000, which is very generous. At this point, further delays significantly reduce the value for me due to the compounding inflation effect. This offer allows you to walk away with more than half while still giving me enough to make this negotiation worthwhile. I hope we can conclude this deal now since continuing would harm my position substantially."
