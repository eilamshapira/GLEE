"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to factor in the inflation for my perspective. In Round 1, I was offered $6000, but now, even though I am offered $5000, it's essentially worth more to me *now* than the $6000 was then, because of the 5% inflation on my side.

I will reject.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 3, taking into account that my money is worth 5% less now than in Round 2, and Bob's money is still worth the same:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this carefully. My money is worth 14.26% less than it was in Round 1. I am being offered $4500 now.

To figure out if I should accept, I need to calculate the *relative* value of $4500 now compared to the original $10,000, and also consider Bob's gain.

My current gains have a multiplier of 1 - 0.1426 = 0.8574

Let's see if this is the best offer I can get in this situation.

If I take the offer, I get $4500 * 0.8574 = $3858.30 relative to round 1 value.
If I don't accept the offer, then Bob will make another offer in the next round.

In the next round, if I offer a higher share for myself, I can get more money. If I offer a smaller share for myself, I can make Bob accept the offer. The current offer seems low considering the limited rounds remaining.

I will reject.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 5. Remember, my money is now worth even less due to inflation. I will also attempt to be reasonable and hopefully end the game here, knowing the rounds are limited.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's do the math. My money is now worth 22.62% less than at the start.

If I accept: I get $4000 * (1 - 0.2262) = $3095.2

This is less than I hoped for, but there are only 6 rounds left! It may be worth it to accept this.

I'll accept.
