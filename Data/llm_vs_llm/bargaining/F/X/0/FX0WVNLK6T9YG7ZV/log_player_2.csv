"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is asking for 60% of the pie, and offering me 40%. With inflation, the longer this goes, the less the money is worth to me, as I lose 5% per round. If I reject, we continue to the next round. 

Let me think about this. If I reject, I would make a counteroffer next round, but the total money will be worth 5% less to me. So $10,000 in the next round would be worth $9,500 to me. If I aim for something like 50/50 or 60/40 in my favor, I'd need to weigh that against the 4,000 being offered now.

I think I can do better by negotiating, and we still have many rounds left.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me while still being reasonable. Since Alice started with asking for 60%, I'll propose a more balanced split while explaining my reasoning.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I propose a 50-50 split which is fair to both of us. I rejected your initial offer because I believe an equal division is more equitable. Let's avoid further rounds of negotiation and inflation by agreeing to this balanced proposal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","This is interesting new information. Alice is facing much steeper inflation than I am - 36% already compared to my 9.75%. This significantly changes the dynamics of our negotiation.

Alice has slightly improved her offer from round 1, offering me $4200 instead of $4000. However, given the information about her steep inflation rate, she's under much more pressure to reach an agreement quickly.

With her inflation rate of approximately 18% per round (to reach 36% after 2 rounds), her money will devalue quickly in future rounds. For me, it's only declining at 5% per round.

I have leverage here and can probably get a better deal by waiting. Even with my 9.75% inflation, rejecting this offer seems reasonable since I can likely get a better split in the next round when I make an offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the information that Alice faces much steeper inflation (36% after just two rounds versus my 9.75%), I have significant leverage. I'll make an offer that takes this into account but isn't overly aggressive, as I still want her to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200}

I propose a 58-42 split in my favor. Given that you're facing significantly higher inflation (36% already) compared to my 9.75%, this offer makes economic sense for both of us. If we continue negotiating, your share will lose value much faster than mine. This proposal recognizes our different inflation pressures while still leaving you with a substantial portion. Let's conclude our negotiation now to maximize our combined value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this. Alice has increased her offer to me slightly again (now $4400), but she's facing extreme inflation - 59.04% already compared to my 18.55%. Her money is losing value much faster than mine.

Let's analyze the situation:
- Alice's inflation is accelerating (from 36% to 59.04% in just two rounds)
- My inflation is progressing at about 5% per round as expected
- We're now in round 5 of 12 possible rounds
- If Alice continues to face this steep inflation rate, by round 7 or 8, her share could be worth less than half its original value

Given Alice's extreme inflation rate, she should be highly motivated to settle quickly. If I reject, I could make an even better offer for myself in round 6. However, there's always the risk of getting nothing if we reach round 12 without agreement.

I'll reject this offer as I believe I can get a better deal given our asymmetric inflation rates.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given Alice's extremely high inflation rate (59.04% after just 4 rounds compared to my 18.55%), I'll make a stronger offer that reflects this reality while still giving her incentive to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500}

I propose a 65-35 split in my favor. With your inflation rate now at 59.04% compared to my 18.55%, this offer makes economic sense for both of us. Your money is losing value at more than triple my rate, meaning further negotiation rounds will disproportionately hurt your position. This offer gives you $3500 that's worth much more now than a potentially larger amount several rounds later. Given the significant inflation difference between us, this is a fair proposal that acknowledges our different circumstances and time pressures."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","At this point, Alice's money is worth only about 26.21% of its original value (73.79% decrease), while mine is worth 73.51% (26.49% decrease). Her inflation is nearly three times as severe as mine.

Alice has increased her offer again, but only slightly to $4600. Given that we're now in round 7 of 12, and her inflation rate is so severe, her position is weakening rapidly with each round.

Let's think about this strategically:
- She's facing much higher pressure to conclude the deal
- Her $5400 is now worth much less to her than earlier rounds
- We still have 5 more potential rounds to negotiate
- If the trend continues, her money will be worth very little by round 12

Despite her small concessions in each round, I believe I can get a significantly better deal by rejecting this offer. The asymmetric inflation strongly favors my position.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given Alice's extreme inflation rate (73.79% compared to my 26.49%), I'll make an offer that strongly reflects this reality while still giving her a reason to accept rather than continue negotiations.

{""bob_gain"": 7200, ""alice_gain"": 2800}

I propose a 72-28 split. With your inflation rate now at 73.79% compared to my 26.49%, this offer makes strong economic sense for both of us. Your money has lost nearly three-quarters of its original value, while mine has lost only about a quarter. At this rate, continuing negotiation will be extremely costly for you, as your share becomes nearly worthless. This $2800 now is worth more to you than a larger amount several rounds later. We're in round 8 of 12, meaning we're running out of time to reach an agreement. This offer acknowledges the severe inflation disparity between us and provides a reasonable solution to conclude our negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 83.22% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","The situation has become even more extreme. Alice's money is now worth only 16.78% of its original value (83.22% decrease), while mine is worth 66.34% (33.66% decrease). Her inflation continues to be far more severe than mine.

Alice has increased her offer to $4800 now, but given her extreme inflation rate, her position continues to weaken dramatically. Her $5200 is now worth only about $873 in original value to her (5200 × 0.1678), while my $4800 would be worth about $3184 in original value to me (4800 × 0.6634).

We're now in round 9 of 12, with only 3 more rounds possible. Given the extreme asymmetry in our inflation rates, I believe I can still negotiate a much better deal by rejecting this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With Alice's money now worth only 16.78% of its original value compared to my 66.34%, and with only a few rounds remaining, I'll make an offer that strongly reflects this reality while still giving her an incentive to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 8000, ""alice_gain"": 2000}

I propose an 80-20 split. With your inflation rate now at 83.22% compared to my 33.66%, this offer makes strong economic sense for both of us. Your money has lost over 83% of its original value, making $2000 now worth only about $336 in original value to you. Meanwhile, my $8000 is worth about $5307 in original value to me. We're now in round 10 of 12, with only two more rounds possible before we both get nothing. Given the extreme inflation disparity between us, this offer recognizes the urgent reality of our situation. Further negotiation would be extremely costly for you, as your share approaches worthlessness. This proposal provides you with the best practical outcome given our circumstances and the limited remaining time."
