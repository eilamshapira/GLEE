"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, since I made the first proposal, I'm asking for a larger share. Let's close the deal quickly to avoid inflation! 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $300,000 out of $1,000,000 (30%)
2. If I reject, in the next round:
   - I can make my own proposal
   - The total amount will be worth $900,000 (10% less)
   - I could propose a more favorable split

While Alice makes a fair point about avoiding inflation, her split is quite aggressive in her favor. I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-proposal in the next round, even accounting for the 10% inflation loss.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer while acknowledging the inflation risk:

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, I propose a more equitable split that still gives you a substantial amount. Let's avoid further inflation losses by agreeing now - we both benefit from a quick resolution.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering a fair deal where both of us get nearly equal shares. This way, we minimize the impact of inflation. Let's finalize this now! 
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is now offering me $460,000 (46%) - a much more balanced split than her first offer
2. Due to 19% inflation, this $460,000 is actually worth about $372,600
3. If I reject:
   - Next round will have 29% total inflation
   - I could propose again, but the value keeps decreasing
   - The offer is getting close to a fair 50-50 split

This is a significantly improved offer from Alice, and considering the mounting inflation pressure, it would be wise to accept now rather than risk further devaluation.
