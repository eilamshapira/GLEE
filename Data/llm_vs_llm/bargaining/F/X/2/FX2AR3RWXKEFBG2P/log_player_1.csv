"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose taking $900,000 and giving $100,000 to Bob.  This gives me a significant share, but also leaves Bob with something. I want to see if he'll take it, or if he'll risk the next round and potentially get more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
