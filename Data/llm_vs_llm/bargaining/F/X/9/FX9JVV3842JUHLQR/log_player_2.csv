"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. Let's get this done quickly! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000
2. If I reject, next round I can make an offer, but the money will be worth 10% less to me
3. $4,000 now is worth more than $4,000 in the next round
4. If I reject and make a counter-offer, Alice might reject it, leading to further rounds and more value loss

While 40% isn't the most generous offer, getting $4,000 now is better than risking further devaluation through multiple rounds of negotiation. The 10% inflation penalty makes quick resolution more valuable.
