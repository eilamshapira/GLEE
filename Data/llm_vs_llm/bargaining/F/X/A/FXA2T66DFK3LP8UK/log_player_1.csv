"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer to Bob for dividing the $1,000,000.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering a fair split that gives me a slight advantage but still provides Bob with a substantial amount. This way, we can both walk away with significant gains, and Bob won't need to risk inflation by rejecting the offer."
