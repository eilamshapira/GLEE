"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. Here's my offer for round 1, taking into account the potential for inflation in future rounds:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

My reasoning:

*   I'm asking for a slight majority initially, recognizing that the longer the game goes on, the more the money devalues for me.
*   This offer is still reasonable and likely to be accepted by Bob. If Bob is purely rational, getting 45% now is better than risking less in later rounds (especially if he is also affected by inflation)."
