"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair initial split, considering I don't know how inflation affects Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split because:
1. It's close to a 50-50 split, which is generally seen as fair
2. I'm taking slightly more (55%) since I know I'll lose 10% value each round if this gets rejected
3. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation"
