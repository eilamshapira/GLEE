5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, I understand your concern about the higher inflation rate you face, but I think a 50-50 split is fair for both of us. If we wait another round, your $5000 would be worth $4500 to you, while my $5000 would be worth $4750 to me. So this offer is still better for you than waiting, and it's more equitable than your initial proposal.",Bob,2,
