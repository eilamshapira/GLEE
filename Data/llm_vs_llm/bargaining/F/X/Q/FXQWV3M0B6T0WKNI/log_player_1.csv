"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I take a bit more considering the inflation disadvantage.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about the higher inflation rate you face, but I think a 50-50 split is fair for both of us. If we wait another round, your $5000 would be worth $4500 to you, while my $5000 would be worth $4750 to me. So this offer is still better for you than waiting, and it's more equitable than your initial proposal. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
