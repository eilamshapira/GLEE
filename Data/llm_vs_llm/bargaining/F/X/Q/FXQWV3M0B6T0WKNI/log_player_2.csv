"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I take a bit more considering the inflation disadvantage. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has offered a split where I would get $4000 and she would get $6000. She's arguing that she should get more considering her inflation disadvantage (her money loses 10% value each round versus my 5%).

Let me analyze this:
- If I reject, we go to the next round where I make an offer
- After one round, my $4000 would be worth $3800 (5% less)
- After one round, Alice's $6000 would be worth $5400 (10% less)

If I counter-offer in the next round, I could propose something more favorable to me. However, Alice might reject if she thinks she can get a better deal now than waiting. The total value of the money is decreasing for both of us with each round.

I think I can get a better deal, so I'll reject this offer and make my own proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I need to make a counter-offer that acknowledges the inflation disadvantage but is more favorable to me than Alice's initial offer.

Since Alice faces 10% inflation per round compared to my 5%, she does have more incentive to reach an agreement sooner. However, a 60-40 split in her favor seems too skewed. I'll propose a more balanced split that still accounts for her higher inflation rate.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concern about the higher inflation rate you face, but I think a 50-50 split is fair for both of us. If we wait another round, your $5000 would be worth $4500 to you, while my $5000 would be worth $4750 to me. So this offer is still better for you than waiting, and it's more equitable than your initial proposal.""}"
