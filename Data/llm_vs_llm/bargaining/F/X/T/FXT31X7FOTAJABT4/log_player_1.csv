Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think an equal 50-50 split would be the fairest approach. This way we both get the same amount, and we can avoid the inflation penalty in future rounds. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
