"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, what do you say? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $40 while she gets $60, which isn't an even split. Since this is the first round, if I reject, I can make a counter-offer but will face a 5% inflation penalty on my share. 

Given that inflation will reduce the value of money in future rounds, and there's a risk of getting nothing if we reach round 12 without agreement, I should weigh the current offer against potential future outcomes.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but I think an equal 50-50 split would be the fairest approach. This way we both get the same amount, and we can avoid the inflation penalty in future rounds. What do you say?""}"
