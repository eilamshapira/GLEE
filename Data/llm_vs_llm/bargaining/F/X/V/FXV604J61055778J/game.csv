550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob. I propose that we split the pot now—I'll take $550000 and you'll receive $450000. Considering that postponing our agreement costs you 10% of the value each round (and mine 5%), I believe this fair division is in both our interests. I’m looking forward to settling this quickly so that we each get as much value as possible.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, let's be practical. Your delay tactic is transparent. I'm offering you the same amount you tried to claim in the previous round. Take it or leave it, but further delays will only hurt both of us.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, I appreciate your message and the offer. However, given the discounting factors and the fact that I’m less affected by the delay than you are, I believe we can come to a more favorable and efficient agreement in the coming round. I’m sorry, but I must reject this offer.",Alice,2,reject
462500.0,537500.0,"Hi Bob, in order to avoid further devaluation and considering our respective discount rates, I’d like to propose the following division for this round: I receive $462500 and you receive $537500. In effective terms, that gives me about $416250 (since my money is worth 5% less this round) and you about $430000 (with a 10% discount). I believe this deal offers you roughly what you’d expect if you waited to propose next round, while protecting both of us from further losses. Let’s settle now to maximize our effective gains.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
430000.0,570000.0,"Alice, it's clear we're both aiming for a favorable split, but these delays are counterproductive. I'm proposing a 57/43 split in my favor. This recognizes the reality of our decreasing gains and provides a substantial amount for both of us.  Let's be sensible and close this deal.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, I appreciate your proposal, but I don’t think this division reflects the balance of our respective positions given the discounting effects. With each round, my share devalues less than yours, so I’m inclined to hold out for a better outcome in the next round. I must reject this offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement shortly before further delays reduce our gains even more.",Alice,4,reject
436000.0,564000.0,"Hi Bob, given that in Round 5 my money is worth about 81.45% of its face value and yours about 65.61%, I propose the following division: I receive $436000 and you receive $564000. In effective terms, this gives me approximately $436000 × 0.8145 ≈ $355000 and you about $564000 × 0.6561 ≈ $370000. This offer is designed to reflect our respective discount factors and gives you an effective outcome that should compare favorably with what you can expect if you delay further. I believe it’s in both our interests to settle now. Looking forward to your response.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
420000.0,580000.0,"Alice, it's time to be realistic. We're past the halfway point, and the value is eroding with every passing round. I'm proposing a 58/42 split.  This is a fair offer considering the circumstances. Let's end this now and avoid further losses.",Bob,6,
,,"Bob, I appreciate your effort, but I'm not convinced that a 58/42 split is the best we can secure given our current discount rates. My effective loss per round is lower than yours, which means I’m in a relatively stronger position if we continue. I’d prefer to propose a division in the next round that better reflects our respective positions and minimizes our overall losses. Let's keep working to reach a fairer outcome before our remaining rounds further erode the value for both of us.",Alice,6,reject
721000.0,279000.0,"Hi Bob, as we move into Round 7 the discount factors are becoming quite significant. At this stage, my share is valued at 0.95^6 (about 73.5% of face value) and yours at 0.90^6 (roughly 53.1%). If you were to wait until Round 8, where you'd be the proposer, the equilibrium outcome (given our respective discount rates of 0.95 and 0.90 per round) would give you a nominal share of about 31% of the pie, translating to an effective payoff of roughly $148300. To make it worthwhile for you to accept now, I’m proposing a division that gives you a nominal $279000 – which, at your discount factor, exactly matches that continuation value – while I receive $721000. This offer precisely compensates you for the prospect of waiting and reflects the cost of delay on our respective shares. I hope you agree that this is a fair and strategically sound resolution for both of us before further erosion sets in.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Alice, stop with the games and inflated jargon. We both know this deal needs to be made soon for it to be worthwhile. 60/40 split in your favor. This is generous considering the circumstances and the rapidly decreasing value. Take it or leave it.",Bob,8,
,,"Bob, I appreciate your direct proposal. With the present discount rates—my share being reduced by 30.17% and yours by 52.17%—your 60/40 split giving me $600000 (an effective value of roughly $418980) is sufficiently attractive given the steep erosion if we delay further. I agree to your offer so that we can both avoid additional losses. Let's settle this deal now.",Alice,8,accept
