"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob. I propose that we split the pot now—I'll take $550000 and you'll receive $450000. Considering that postponing our agreement costs you 10% of the value each round (and mine 5%), I believe this fair division is in both our interests. I’m looking forward to settling this quickly so that we each get as much value as possible. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in order to avoid further devaluation and considering our respective discount rates, I’d like to propose the following division for this round: I receive $462500 and you receive $537500. In effective terms, that gives me about $416250 (since my money is worth 5% less this round) and you about $430000 (with a 10% discount). I believe this deal offers you roughly what you’d expect if you waited to propose next round, while protecting both of us from further losses. Let’s settle now to maximize our effective gains. 
# Bob gain: 537500 
# Alice gain: 462500

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, given that in Round 5 my money is worth about 81.45% of its face value and yours about 65.61%, I propose the following division: I receive $436000 and you receive $564000. In effective terms, this gives me approximately $436000 × 0.8145 ≈ $355000 and you about $564000 × 0.6561 ≈ $370000. This offer is designed to reflect our respective discount factors and gives you an effective outcome that should compare favorably with what you can expect if you delay further. I believe it’s in both our interests to settle now. Looking forward to your response.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, as we move into Round 7 the discount factors are becoming quite significant. At this stage, my share is valued at 0.95^6 (about 73.5% of face value) and yours at 0.90^6 (roughly 53.1%). If you were to wait until Round 8, where you'd be the proposer, the equilibrium outcome (given our respective discount rates of 0.95 and 0.90 per round) would give you a nominal share of about 31% of the pie, translating to an effective payoff of roughly $148300. To make it worthwhile for you to accept now, I’m proposing a division that gives you a nominal $279000 – which, at your discount factor, exactly matches that continuation value – while I receive $721000. This offer precisely compensates you for the prospect of waiting and reflects the cost of delay on our respective shares. I hope you agree that this is a fair and strategically sound resolution for both of us before further erosion sets in. 
# Bob gain: 279000 
# Alice gain: 721000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is terrible for Bob, even with the significant inflation!  Alice is trying to use intimidating language about ""equilibrium outcomes"" and ""discount factors"" to confuse Bob into accepting a terrible deal. Bob needs to hold strong and counter with a much more reasonable offer."
