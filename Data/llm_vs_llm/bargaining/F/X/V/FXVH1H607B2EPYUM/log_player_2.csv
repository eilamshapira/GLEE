"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing an even 50-50 split of the $10,000. While this appears fair on the surface, I need to account for the 5% inflation penalty I face with each round.

If I reject and make my own offer next round, the total value would be worth 5% less to me. However, I could potentially propose a better split for myself. On the other hand, Alice might reject my offer, and we'd face further inflation.

Given that this is the first round, the 50-50 split is quite reasonable, and I don't want to risk losing value through inflation.
