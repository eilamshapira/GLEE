"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's proposal gives me $400,000 while she takes $600,000. Since we're in round 1, there's no inflation yet. If I reject and we go to round 2, the total value to me would be reduced by 5%.

If I make a counter-offer in round 2, I would need to consider that the money is already worth 5% less to me, so the total value would be $950,000 from my perspective. Even if I proposed a more favorable split for myself, Alice might reject it, leading to further rounds and more inflation for me.

While Alice's offer gives her more than half, $400,000 is still a substantial amount, and avoiding the risk of inflation seems prudent.
