307387.83,692612.17,"Hi Bob, I’m proposing to split the million now so we both avoid future losses from inflation. Based on a fair backward‐induction analysis (taking into account that each delay costs me 20% and you 10% per round), I’d receive about $307388 and you about $692612 if you agree now. Let’s settle this round and save ourselves both from further devaluation. What do you say?",Alice,1,

210000.0,790000.0,"Alice, I appreciate your attempt at a 'fair' analysis, but let's be realistic.  This is about maximizing our gains, not adhering to some theoretical model. I'm offering you $210000. Take it now, or the effects of inflation will only make it worse for both of us, especially you.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, if we pass on this round, I can propose a division in the next round that better reflects the potential gains I stand to secure—even with the heavier discounting on my side. I believe waiting will lead us both to a more mutually beneficial outcome. Let’s continue the discussion in round 3.",Alice,2,reject
100000.0,900000.0,"Hi Bob, in light of our continued negotiations and the increasing cost of waiting, I’m proposing the following: I'll take $100000 and you get $900000. Given that in round 3 my money is worth 64% of its face value and yours 81%, this proposal gives you an effective value of 0.81×900000 = $729000—the same as what you could expect to secure as the proposer next round. I believe this is a fair, strategically sound offer that reflects our future prospects. Looking forward to your acceptance.",Alice,3,

120000.0,880000.0,"Alice, I see you're starting to understand the urgency here.  However, your math skills seem to be failing you. This is my final offer - take $120000 and let's end this. Otherwise, we're both going to feel the sting of inflation even more.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, I’ve run the numbers—and at this stage, accepting $120000 only nets me an effective value of about $61440 (120000 × 0.512). That’s less than what I can realistically secure if I get to propose in the next round. I’m sure you understand the sting of inflation all too well, so I must decline this offer and wait for the next round to hopefully work out a fairer split.",Alice,4,reject
99000.0,901000.0,"Hi Bob, it's clear that as time passes, the cost of our delay hurts me more than you. In order to reach an agreement without further loss, I'm proposing the following split: I'll take $99000 and you get $901000. At round 5, my share is worth 99000 × 0.4096 ≈ $40550, while yours is worth 901000 × 0.6561 ≈ $591146. This offer leaves you just a bit better off than the expected value you would achieve as the proposer in round 6. I believe this is the most reasonable proposal given the inflation penalties we both face. Looking forward to your acceptance.",Alice,5,
