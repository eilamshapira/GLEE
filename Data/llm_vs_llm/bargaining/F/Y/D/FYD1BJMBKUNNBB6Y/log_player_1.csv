"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 307387.83, ""bob_gain"": 692612.17, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I’m proposing to split the million now so we both avoid future losses from inflation. Based on a fair backward‐induction analysis (taking into account that each delay costs me 20% and you 10% per round), I’d receive about $307,388 and you about $692,612 if you agree now. Let’s settle this round and save ourselves both from further devaluation. What do you say?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your attempt at a 'fair' analysis, but let's be realistic.  This is about maximizing our gains, not adhering to some theoretical model. I'm offering you $210000. Take it now, or the effects of inflation will only make it worse for both of us, especially you. 
# Alice gain: 210000 
# Bob gain: 790000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, if we pass on this round, I can propose a division in the next round that better reflects the potential gains I stand to secure—even with the heavier discounting on my side. I believe waiting will lead us both to a more mutually beneficial outcome. Let’s continue the discussion in round 3.""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 100000, ""bob_gain"": 900000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, in light of our continued negotiations and the increasing cost of waiting, I’m proposing the following: I'll take $100,000 and you get $900,000. Given that in round 3 my money is worth 64% of its face value and yours 81%, this proposal gives you an effective value of 0.81×900,000 = $729,000—the same as what you could expect to secure as the proposer next round. I believe this is a fair, strategically sound offer that reflects our future prospects. Looking forward to your acceptance.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see you're starting to understand the urgency here.  However, your math skills seem to be failing you. This is my final offer - take $120000 and let's end this. Otherwise, we're both going to feel the sting of inflation even more. 
# Alice gain: 120000 
# Bob gain: 880000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, I’ve run the numbers—and at this stage, accepting $120,000 only nets me an effective value of about $61,440 (120,000 × 0.512). That’s less than what I can realistically secure if I get to propose in the next round. I’m sure you understand the sting of inflation all too well, so I must decline this offer and wait for the next round to hopefully work out a fairer split.""}"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 99000, ""bob_gain"": 901000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, it's clear that as time passes, the cost of our delay hurts me more than you. In order to reach an agreement without further loss, I'm proposing the following split: I'll take $99,000 and you get $901,000. At round 5, my share is worth 99,000 × 0.4096 ≈ $40,550, while yours is worth 901,000 × 0.6561 ≈ $591,146. This offer leaves you just a bit better off than the expected value you would achieve as the proposer in round 6. I believe this is the most reasonable proposal given the inflation penalties we both face. Looking forward to your acceptance.""}"
