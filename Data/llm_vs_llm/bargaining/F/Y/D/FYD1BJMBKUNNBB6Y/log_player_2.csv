"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m proposing to split the million now so we both avoid future losses from inflation. Based on a fair backward‐induction analysis (taking into account that each delay costs me 20% and you 10% per round), I’d receive about $307388 and you about $692612 if you agree now. Let’s settle this round and save ourselves both from further devaluation. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 692612.17 
# Alice gain: 307387.83

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 790000, ""alice_gain"": 210000, ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your attempt at a 'fair' analysis, but let's be realistic.  This is about maximizing our gains, not adhering to some theoretical model. I'm offering you $210,000. Take it now, or the effects of inflation will only make it worse for both of us, especially you.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in light of our continued negotiations and the increasing cost of waiting, I’m proposing the following: I'll take $100000 and you get $900000. Given that in round 3 my money is worth 64% of its face value and yours 81%, this proposal gives you an effective value of 0.81×900000 = $729000—the same as what you could expect to secure as the proposer next round. I believe this is a fair, strategically sound offer that reflects our future prospects. Looking forward to your acceptance. 
# Bob gain: 900000 
# Alice gain: 100000

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 880000, ""alice_gain"": 120000, ""message"": ""Alice, I see you're starting to understand the urgency here.  However, your math skills seem to be failing you. This is my final offer - take $120,000 and let's end this. Otherwise, we're both going to feel the sting of inflation even more.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, it's clear that as time passes, the cost of our delay hurts me more than you. In order to reach an agreement without further loss, I'm proposing the following split: I'll take $99000 and you get $901000. At round 5, my share is worth 99000 × 0.4096 ≈ $40550, while yours is worth 901000 × 0.6561 ≈ $591146. This offer leaves you just a bit better off than the expected value you would achieve as the proposer in round 6. I believe this is the most reasonable proposal given the inflation penalties we both face. Looking forward to your acceptance. 
# Bob gain: 901000 
# Alice gain: 99000
