"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make it fair and split the $1000000 equally. This way we both walk away without any losses. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $500,000 for me
2. If I reject and we go to next round:
   * The money will be worth 20% less to me
   * I could make an offer, but Alice would need to accept it
   * If Alice rejects, the money loses even more value in subsequent rounds

While a 50-50 split might seem fair, I could potentially get more by making a counter-offer. However, the risk of the 20% devaluation is significant.

If I reject, the $1M pool would effectively be worth $800,000 to me in the next round. Even if I proposed a more favorable split then, Alice might reject it, leading to further devaluation.

Given the significant devaluation risk and the fact that $500,000 is a substantial sum, I'll accept this offer.
