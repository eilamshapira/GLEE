"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer as it's very unfair - 1000$ for me and 9000$ for Alice is a heavily skewed distribution. Even with potential inflation in future rounds, I can aim for a more equitable split by making a counter-proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I propose a fair 50-50 split of the money. This is a reasonable and equitable division that gives both parties an equal share of the total amount. Given that delay causes inflation to affect my gains, it's in both our interests to reach a fair agreement quickly."
