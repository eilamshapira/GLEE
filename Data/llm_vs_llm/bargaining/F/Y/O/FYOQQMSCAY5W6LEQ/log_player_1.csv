"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, considering I lose more to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob loses more to inflation, I'll think about it. However, I still want a fair share.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob rejected my initial offer and then made a proposal that favors himself, I'll make a counteroffer. Considering the inflation, the total value of the money is now:

For me: $100 * 0.9 * 0.9 = $81 (10% less for two rounds)
For Bob: $100 * 0.8 * 0.8 = $64 (20% less for two rounds)

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground before inflation eats away too much!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation difference, I think this is a fairer split. 
# Alice gain: 43 
# Bob gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is still not in my favor, but I need to consider the increasing inflation. Since the money I gain is worth 27.1% less and Bob's gain is worth 48.8% less, I should think about accepting an offer that gives me a relatively larger share of the remaining value.

However, Bob's offer still gives him a larger share. I'll reject it and try to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer. The total value of the money is now:

For me: $100 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = $65.61 (10% less for four rounds)
For Bob: $100 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = $40.96 (20% less for four rounds)

I'll try to get a larger share of the remaining value. Here's my offer for Round 5:

{""alice_gain"": 58, 
""bob_gain"": 42, 
""message"": ""Inflation is eating away our money, let's agree on a split before it's too late!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a bit more due to the inflation difference. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is still not ideal, but I need to consider the significant inflation. The money I gain is worth 40.95% less, and Bob's gain is worth 67.23% less. Given the large difference in inflation, I should think about accepting an offer that gives me a relatively stable share.

Bob's offer gives him a larger share, but it's not drastically unfair. I'll accept it to avoid further losses due to inflation.
