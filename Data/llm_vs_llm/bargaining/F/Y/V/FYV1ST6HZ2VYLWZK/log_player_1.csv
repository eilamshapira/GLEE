"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
    ""alice_gain"": 600000,
    ""bob_gain"": 400000,
    ""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to avoid inflation eating into our gains. Let's conclude this quickly and both walk away with a substantial amount.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a quick resolution, Alice. How about a 55/45 split in my favor?  It's still a very good deal for you, and we both avoid another round of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. If I accept now:
   * I get $450,000, but with 20% inflation, it's worth $360,000 to me
   * Better than nothing, but significantly less than my initial proposal

2. If I reject and make another offer:
   * Next round will have even more inflation (40% for me)
   * Bob seems to be affected less by inflation (only 5% per round)
   * This gives Bob a stronger negotiating position

Given that:
- The inflation affects me much more severely than Bob
- Another round would reduce my purchasing power significantly
- Bob's offer, even with inflation, is still substantial
- Bob has a stronger position due to the asymmetric inflation
