"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to avoid inflation eating into our gains. Let's conclude this quickly and both walk away with a substantial amount. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Alice's offer is reasonable, I'm willing to gamble that she's also feeling the pressure of inflation.  It's worth seeing if I can secure a better deal in the next round."
