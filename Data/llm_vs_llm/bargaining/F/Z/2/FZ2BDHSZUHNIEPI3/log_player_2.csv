"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to think carefully about this offer. 

Alice is offering me $40 out of $100, which means she gets $60.

If I reject and we go to the next round, the total value decreases by 5% for me, so the pot would be worth $95 to me. If I then propose a more favorable split, Alice would have to consider that the money is worth 10% less to her in round 2 (worth $90 to her).

Given the differing inflation rates, I could potentially make a better offer for myself in the next round that Alice would still accept, since she faces higher inflation.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since we're now in round 2, I need to consider that the money is worth 5% less to me (so $95 total value) and 10% less to Alice (so $90 total value to her).

I'll propose a split that's more favorable to me while still being reasonable for Alice to accept given her higher inflation rate.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'm offering you $45, Alice. This is a fair offer considering the decreasing value of money in future rounds. If we move to round 3, the money will be worth even less to both of us, so it's in our mutual interest to reach an agreement now."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer.

Alice is now offering me $45 out of $100, which is $5 more than her initial offer.

Due to inflation, the current value to me is worth 9.75% less than round 1, so this $45 is worth about $40.61 in round 1 terms.

If I reject and go to round 4, the money would be worth even less to both of us. For me, it would be around 14.75% less valuable, and for Alice, it would be 29% less valuable.

Since Alice has increased her offer and faces higher inflation than I do, and considering that her current offer ($45) is already better than her initial offer even after accounting for inflation, I should accept.
