"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

If I reject, we move to the next round where:
- I can make a counter-offer
- But the money will be worth 20% less to me and 5% less to Alice
- My $4000 would become worth $3200 to me
- Alice's $6000 would become worth $5700 to her

Given the significant inflation penalty I face (20%), and that $4000 is a substantial portion (40%) of the total, this actually isn't a terrible initial offer. If I reject, I risk ending up with less due to the harsh inflation penalty I face.
