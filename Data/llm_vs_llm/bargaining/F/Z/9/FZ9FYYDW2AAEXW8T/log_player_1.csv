"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a division that accounts for the different inflation rates we face. Since I lose value faster (20% vs 10% per round), I should aim for a favorable first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose I get $60 and you get $40, which is a fair split considering I face higher inflation risk if we continue to later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 28.85 
# Bob gain: 71.15 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept now, I get $28.85, but it's worth 20% less, so effectively $23.08
2. If I reject, we go to round 3, but then:
   - Any money will be worth 40% less for me (another 20% drop)
   - For Bob, it will be worth 30% less (another 10% drop)
   - This significant depreciation makes getting a better deal in the next round difficult

While $23.08 is much less than my initial proposal, the rapid depreciation of value makes rejecting risky. A future round would need a much higher nominal amount to match even this offer's real value.
