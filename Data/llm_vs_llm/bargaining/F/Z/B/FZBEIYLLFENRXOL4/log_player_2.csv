"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a large share for me, but you still get a decent amount. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. 

She's offering me $200,000 out of the $1,000,000 total, which is 20% of the pot. Since there's 10% inflation for me each round, waiting has a cost. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, even if Alice accepted my proposal for a larger share, that money would be worth 10% less to me.

Given the inflation penalty I face and the fact that $200,000 is a substantial amount, I'll accept this offer rather than risk further devaluation.
