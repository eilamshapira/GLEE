"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

A $400,000 offer isn't bad, but since this is the first round and there's only 5% inflation per round, I can afford to negotiate for a better deal. The current split (40/60) favors Alice too much.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, my potential gains would be reduced by 5% due to inflation, but I could propose a more equitable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split, but accounting for the 5% inflation that affects my portion. Since we're in round 2, the real value of what I receive will be reduced by 5%, so I'll adjust my proposal accordingly to compensate.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

This offer is more equitable than the previous 40/60 split, giving me a slight advantage to offset the inflation I've already incurred. It's still reasonable enough that Alice might accept it rather than risk further rounds where both of us could lose value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is an interesting development. I now know that Alice is actually affected by higher inflation (36%) compared to my inflation (9.75%). This changes the calculation significantly.

Let me analyze Alice's offer of 420,000:
- With 9.75% inflation for me, my real value would be: 420,000 * (1 - 0.0975) = 379,050
- Alice's 580,000 with 36% inflation is worth: 580,000 * (1 - 0.36) = 371,200

Given that:
1. Alice is actually suffering from much higher inflation than me
2. The real values after inflation are fairly close (379,050 vs 371,200)
3. If we continue, both of our inflation penalties will increase further
4. This offer is better than her first offer (420k vs 400k)
