"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Split it evenly, fair for both""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight adjustment for taking the risk of going to the next round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I need to consider that when evaluating Bob's offer. 

To calculate the value of Bob's offer to me, I'll multiply the offered amount by 0.9 (1 - 0.10 inflation).

Adjusted Alice gain: 4500 * 0.9 = 4050

Considering this, I think I can do better. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 20% less than the original amount (10% less in Round 2 and another 10% less in Round 3).

To calculate the value, I'll multiply the amount by 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81.

I'll make an offer that takes this into account. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Still a fair share, considering the wait""
}
```"
