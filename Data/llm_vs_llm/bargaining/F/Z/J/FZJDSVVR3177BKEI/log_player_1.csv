"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split the pot evenly—$500,000 for each—right now. Settling in round 1 avoids the 5% inflation hit on my share, and it gives us both our full value immediately. I believe this fair division benefits us both, so please accept this offer.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I value this money more than you do, and I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. Let's get this done. This is a fair offer considering inflation will hurt me more in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, your current offer gives me an effective value of about $380,000 (after applying my 5% discount), while I could do better by making a proposal in the next round when I have the advantage of a milder discount relative to you. I'm therefore opting to reject this offer and move to round 3.""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 435000, ""bob_gain"": 565000, ""message"": ""Bob, in round 3 the inflation has further reduced our pot’s value (I'm at a 10% discount and you’re at a 15% discount relative to round 1). To keep things moving and avoid additional losses, I propose a nominal split where I get $435,000 and you get $565,000. In effective terms, that means you'll receive about $480,250 (565,000 × 0.85) and I’ll end up with roughly $391,500 (435,000 × 0.9). This offer aims to give you a slight edge over your expected continuation value if you were to propose in round 4 while preserving as much value as I can. I hope you find this compromise acceptable so we can conclude our negotiation swiftly.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my need for this money is greater. The inflation is hurting both of us. I propose a 70/30 split. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate the urgency you’re signaling. However, a 70/30 split in your favor leaves me with a nominal $300,000—which, after the 14.26% discount, is effectively about $257,220 relative to round 1’s value. Given that I’ll be the proposer in the next round—and taking into account that while both our pots shrink with each round, your share is hit harder by inflation—I believe my position as next proposer still allows me a chance to secure a more favorable division. Therefore, I’m rejecting your offer and moving us toward round 5.""}"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 150000, ""bob_gain"": 850000, ""message"": ""Bob, we’re now in round 5 and the clock is ticking—with my share now worth only about 81.45% of round‑1 value and yours roughly 62.5%, every moment we delay cuts deep into what we walk away with. To avoid further loss, I’m proposing a division where you get a nominal $850,000 and I take $150,000. This means your effective payoff is about $850,000 × 0.625 ≈ $531,250, while mine comes to roughly $150,000 × 0.8145 ≈ $122,175. I realize this is very generous to you, but given that if you wait until round 6 your own discount will likely erode the pot even further—and you’d have to bear the risk of continued delay—I believe this offer is a fair compromise. I hope you accept this deal so we can end the process before further inflation shrinks our returns.""}"
