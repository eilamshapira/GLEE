"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the pot evenly—$500000 for each—right now. Settling in round 1 avoids the 5% inflation hit on my share, and it gives us both our full value immediately. I believe this fair division benefits us both, so please accept this offer. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, in round 3 the inflation has further reduced our pot’s value (I'm at a 10% discount and you’re at a 15% discount relative to round 1). To keep things moving and avoid additional losses, I propose a nominal split where I get $435000 and you get $565000. In effective terms, that means you'll receive about $480250 (565000 × 0.85) and I’ll end up with roughly $391500 (435000 × 0.9). This offer aims to give you a slight edge over your expected continuation value if you were to propose in round 4 while preserving as much value as I can. I hope you find this compromise acceptable so we can conclude our negotiation swiftly. 
# Bob gain: 565000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we’re now in round 5 and the clock is ticking—with my share now worth only about 81.45% of round‑1 value and yours roughly 62.5%, every moment we delay cuts deep into what we walk away with. To avoid further loss, I’m proposing a division where you get a nominal $850000 and I take $150000. This means your effective payoff is about $850000 × 0.625 ≈ $531250, while mine comes to roughly $150000 × 0.8145 ≈ $122175. I realize this is very generous to you, but given that if you wait until round 6 your own discount will likely erode the pot even further—and you’d have to bear the risk of continued delay—I believe this offer is a fair compromise. I hope you accept this deal so we can end the process before further inflation shrinks our returns. 
# Bob gain: 850000 
# Alice gain: 150000
