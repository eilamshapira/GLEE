"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest we divide the $100 by giving me $70 and you $30. This ensures we both secure a fair share immediately, avoiding any potential devaluation due to inflation in subsequent rounds. I hope you agree to end the game swiftly! 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering the inflation affecting my share, I propose we split it 60/40 in my favor this round. This way, we can still end the game quickly but with a more balanced outcome given the circumstances. What do you think?""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, as we move into round 3 the gap between our positions has widened—your future offers will be subject to even higher inflation (your money is now worth 20% less than in round 1 if we wait further). With that in mind, I propose a quick settlement where I receive $99 and you get $1. I know it’s not much, but considering the harsher devaluation awaiting you in future rounds, accepting this offer grants you a better outcome than the uncertainty of further delays. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{

  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, given the increasing impact of inflation on my share, now worth nearly 30% less than in round 1, I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor. This offer reflects the urgency to settle before my share devalues further, yet still provides you with a significant portion. Let's end this game now to avoid further complications.""

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal for round 5: I get $72 and you get $28. I know this might look uneven at first glance, but consider the effects of inflation on your share. If we delay further and you get to propose in the next round, you'll likely be forced to offer me a much higher amount to get my acceptance—and that means your own share will drop even further in real terms. Accepting $28 now guarantees you a better effective value than risking another round with even steeper devaluation. Let's settle now before the numbers slip further. 
# Bob gain: 28 
# Alice gain: 72

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 80,
  ""alice_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, we're now in round 6, and my share is worth over 40% less than in round 1 due to inflation. To counteract this significant devaluation, I'm proposing an 80/20 split in my favor. This might seem steep, but it's a necessary adjustment to secure a reasonable outcome for me before my share diminishes even further. Let's end this now to avoid further erosion of value.""

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, for round 7 I propose that I receive $27 while you get $73. If you accept now, your $73 will suffer an inflation discount of about 47%, giving you an effective value of roughly $38.7. If you reject and wait for round 8, you’ll be the proposer, but the inflation will likely push your effective multiplier even lower (around 45% or less), meaning even a high nominal amount won’t secure you as much real value. This offer secures you a better effective outcome than risking further devaluation. Let's settle this now before the numbers slip further away! 
# Bob gain: 73 
# Alice gain: 27
