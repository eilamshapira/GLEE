"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. I need to make an offer to Bob, keeping in mind the inflation that affects me, but not him. My goal is to maximize my gain while ensuring Bob accepts.

Here's my first offer:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Bob $40. This is a substantial amount, making it more likely he'll accept in the first round. I'm keeping $60 for myself. I'm hoping the immediate gratification of $40 is enough to make Bob accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the inflation. My potential gain is now worth 5% less than it was in round 1. Bob is offering me $45. I need to decide if this is better than risking another round where my potential gain depreciates further.

Let's analyze:

*   **Accepting:** I get $45 now. This is worth 5% less than $45 in round 1.
*   **Rejecting:** I risk another round where the total pot is still $100, but my potential gain will be worth 10% less than it was in round 1. Bob will then make another offer, potentially lower than $45.

Given the inflation, I'm inclined to accept this offer. It's a decent amount, and the risk of getting less in the next round due to further inflation outweighs the potential benefit of holding out for a better deal.

```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
