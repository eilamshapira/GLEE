"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, 50/50 split. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:

1. It's a fair 50/50 split, which is equitable
2. If I reject, the total value will decrease by 10% to $90 in the next round
3. Even if I make a more favorable proposal next round, Alice might reject it, leading to further depreciation
4. A 50/50 split is a common and reasonable starting point in negotiation games

Given these considerations, it makes sense to accept this fair offer now rather than risk value depreciation in future rounds.
