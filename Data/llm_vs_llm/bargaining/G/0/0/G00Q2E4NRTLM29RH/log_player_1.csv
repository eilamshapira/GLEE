"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get your money immediately without any inflation impact.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's split the difference a bit more evenly.  How about 55-45? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The money is already worth 20% less to me in this round, so 45$ is actually worth only 36$ to me. I can make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Bob, due to the 20% inflation impact on my side each round, I need a larger share to make up for the lost value. 65-35 split would actually be worth about 52$ to me now, which is quite fair. Let's reach an agreement before inflation reduces the value further for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's stop wasting time and split this evenly. 50-50 is the fairest option and avoids further losses for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. Due to inflation, if I wait longer, my losses will be too significant. With 48.8% inflation, the $50 is worth about $25.60 to me now, and if I wait another round, it will be worth even less. Better to secure this amount now than risk further devaluation."
