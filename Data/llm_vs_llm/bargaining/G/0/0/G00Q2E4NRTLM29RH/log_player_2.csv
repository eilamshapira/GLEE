"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get your money immediately without any inflation impact. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, due to the 20% inflation impact on my side each round, I need a larger share to make up for the lost value. 65-35 split would actually be worth about 52$ to me now, which is quite fair. Let's reach an agreement before inflation reduces the value further for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

While Alice claims a large inflation impact, accepting such a low offer sets a bad precedent and leaves me with very little. It's worth risking further rounds to negotiate a better split, even with my own inflation concerns."
