"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

If I reject and move to the next round:
- The $50 I'm offered now would be worth only $40 due to 20% inflation
- I'd get to make a counter-offer, but Alice might reject it
- Further rounds would reduce the money's value even more

The current offer is:
- Fair split (50-50)
- I get $50 at full value
- No risk of further devaluation

Given these factors, accepting the fair split now is better than risking a lower effective value in future rounds.
