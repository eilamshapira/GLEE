"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
I'll propose to keep $9,000 and give Bob $1,000. This seems like a good starting point, giving Bob a small incentive to accept while ensuring I get the majority. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob's offer is getting more generous, but it's still not good enough for me. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to increase my offer slightly, but I still want to keep the majority. I'll offer Bob $3,000 this time. Let's see if this is enough to convince him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm starting to feel the pressure of the decreasing value of money. Bob's offer of a 50/50 split is not ideal, but it's better than risking getting nothing at all in later rounds. I'll accept this offer."
