"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly and avoid inflation losses 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","While an even split seems fair at first glance, I need to consider the inflation effect carefully. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but the total value will be worth 10% less to me.

Current offer: I get $5,000
If I reject, the next round's maximum value to me would be 90% of $10,000 = $9,000

Given the uncertainty about how inflation affects Alice and the risk of prolonged negotiation reducing the total value further, this seems like a reasonable offer.
