"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer to divide the $10,000. Since there's a 10% inflation penalty per round for me, I should propose a fair offer that Bob is likely to accept right away.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm offering an equal split of the money. This is fair and gives us both a significant amount, while avoiding the inflation penalty that would reduce my earnings if we go to another round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's slightly less favorable to me than my initial proposal, the 10% inflation penalty means that if I reject this and we go to another round, my share would be worth even less. Getting $4,500 now is better than risking further deterioration of value due to inflation."
