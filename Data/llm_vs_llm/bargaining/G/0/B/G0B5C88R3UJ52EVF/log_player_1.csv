"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Bob, let's split it 60/40. This is a fair deal considering we both get a significant amount, and we avoid the risk of further inflation devaluing the money.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, given the inflation affecting my share, I propose a 55/45 split. This way, we both still get a good amount, but I need to account for the decreasing value of money on my side. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
