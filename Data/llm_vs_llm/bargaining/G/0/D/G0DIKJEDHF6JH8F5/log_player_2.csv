"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. This split accounts for my inflation concerns and your fairness concerns. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is heavily weighting the inflation against her, even though it's only a 19% decrease so far. I'm willing to negotiate, but not to be taken advantage of. I need to signal I'm willing to walk away."
