Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your point about the 5% loss, but a 60-40 split seems too much in your favor. Considering the situation, I'm offering a 55-45 split. This way, we both get a significant amount, and you'll still be compensated for the potential losses in the next rounds.

# Bob gain: 550000

With a 5% loss per round, I'm now at a disadvantage. This 62-38 split accounts for the value I've already lost. If we keep going back and forth, I'll need to ask for even more to compensate for additional losses. This is a fair offer considering the asymmetric inflation affecting only my share.""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see your point about adjusting for inflation, but a 62-38 split is still too skewed in your favor. Given that my share doesn't lose value, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to my previous offer. This 57-43 split is a more reasonable compromise, considering the circumstances. Let's settle on this before the inflation affects your share further.

I've now lost 14.26% of my purchasing power due to inflation, which means I need to compensate with a higher percentage. At this 64-36 split, my effective value is only around 549,000 due to inflation, while you get your full 360,000. If we continue to the next round, I'll need an even higher percentage to offset my losses. Let's agree now - this is actually quite fair considering the asymmetric inflation.""}"

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your calculations, but I still think your offers are too one-sided. You're right that your effective value is lower due to inflation, but that doesn't mean I should accept a significantly smaller share. My offer of a 58-42 split is a more balanced compromise, considering both our perspectives. Let's settle on this before we run out of rounds.

This means my 660,000 is effectively worth only about 510,800 to me, while you get your full 340,000. If we continue, my effective value will drop even more. This is a fair mathematical adjustment for the asymmetric inflation. If we keep negotiating, I'll need to ask for an even higher percentage to offset my mounting losses.

Your effective value may be lower, but that doesn't mean I should accept a significantly smaller share. We're running out of rounds, and I'm willing to make a small concession. This 59-41 split is my final compromise. If you reject this, I'll assume you're willing to risk getting nothing.

Let me be clear: the inflation means I need a higher nominal amount to get a fair effective value. This is my final reasonable offer based on the math.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the urgency and the math behind your offers. However, I'm not willing to accept a deal that gives me less than 60% of the original amount. Considering the inflation's impact on your share, I'm making a final offer that splits the difference between our previous proposals. This 60-40 split is my last compromise. If you reject this, I'm prepared to walk away with nothing, as I believe it's better than accepting an unfair deal.
