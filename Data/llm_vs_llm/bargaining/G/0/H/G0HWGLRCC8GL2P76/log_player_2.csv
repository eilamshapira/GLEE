"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, considering that my money loses 5% value each round and yours doesn't, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because if we delay, I'll need to ask for more to compensate for my losses, while your share keeps its value. Let's agree now and both walk away with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000

""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your point about the 5% loss, but a 60-40 split seems too much in your favor. Considering the situation, I'm offering a 55-45 split. This way, we both get a significant amount, and you'll still be compensated for the potential losses in the next rounds.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I need to adjust my offer due to the inflation I've already experienced. With a 5% loss per round, I'm now at a disadvantage. This 62-38 split accounts for the value I've already lost. If we keep going back and forth, I'll need to ask for even more to compensate for additional losses. This is a fair offer considering the asymmetric inflation affecting only my share. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000

""alice_gain"": 430000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I see your point about adjusting for inflation, but a 62-38 split is still too skewed in your favor. Given that my share doesn't lose value, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to my previous offer. This 57-43 split is a more reasonable compromise, considering the circumstances. Let's settle on this before the inflation affects your share further.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be logical about this. I've now lost 14.26% of my purchasing power due to inflation, which means I need to compensate with a higher percentage. At this 64-36 split, my effective value is only around 549000 due to inflation, while you get your full 360000. If we continue to the next round, I'll need an even higher percentage to offset my losses. Let's agree now - this is actually quite fair considering the asymmetric inflation. 
# Bob gain: 360000 
# Alice gain: 640000

""alice_gain"": 420000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your calculations, but I still think your offers are too one-sided. You're right that your effective value is lower due to inflation, but that doesn't mean I should accept a significantly smaller share. My offer of a 58-42 split is a more balanced compromise, considering both our perspectives. Let's settle on this before we run out of rounds.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're now at round 7, and I've lost 22.62% of my value already. This means my 660000 is effectively worth only about 510800 to me, while you get your full 340000. If we continue, my effective value will drop even more. This is a fair mathematical adjustment for the asymmetric inflation. If we keep negotiating, I'll need to ask for an even higher percentage to offset my mounting losses. Let's end this now with a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob gain: 340000 
# Alice gain: 660000

""alice_gain"": 410000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I see the math behind your offers, but I still think you're overcompensating for the inflation. Your effective value may be lower, but that doesn't mean I should accept a significantly smaller share. We're running out of rounds, and I'm willing to make a small concession. This 59-41 split is my final compromise. If you reject this, I'll assume you're willing to risk getting nothing.""}"

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're now just 4 rounds from getting nothing. At this point, I've lost 30.17% of my value, making my 680000 effectively worth only about 474800 to me, while you get your full 320000. We're both losing money by continuing this negotiation. Let me be clear: the inflation means I need a higher nominal amount to get a fair effective value. This is my final reasonable offer based on the math. We need to conclude this deal before we both walk away with nothing. 
# Bob gain: 320000 
# Alice gain: 680000

""alice_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the urgency and the math behind your offers. However, I'm not willing to accept a deal that gives me less than 60% of the original amount. Considering the inflation's impact on your share, I'm making a final offer that splits the difference between our previous proposals. This 60-40 split is my last compromise. If you reject this, I'm prepared to walk away with nothing, as I believe it's better than accepting an unfair deal.""}"
