Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}

Given that we're in the second round, and inflation is affecting me by 5% per round, I want to secure a larger portion to offset this loss. With this proposal, I'm offering Alice a reasonable $300,000 while ensuring I get enough to account for the inflation effect. This is a fair division considering the circumstances."

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 550000
