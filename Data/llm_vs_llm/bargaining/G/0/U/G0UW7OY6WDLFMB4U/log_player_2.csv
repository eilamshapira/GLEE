"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 60, you take 40. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. 

Alice is offering me $40 out of $100, while keeping $60 for herself. This isn't an even split, but I need to consider the inflation effect if I reject this offer.

If I reject and we go to the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me, meaning the $100 would effectively be worth $80 to me. If I then propose a more favorable split, Alice might reject it, leading to even more inflation.

Given the higher inflation rate I face (20% vs Alice's 10%), I'm at a disadvantage in prolonged negotiations. Getting $40 now is better than potentially getting a larger amount of less valuable money later.
