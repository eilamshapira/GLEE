"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me 40$ out of 100$, keeping 60$ for herself. While this isn't an equal split, I should consider:

1. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
2. There's no inflation affecting my value, so the money's worth stays the same for me
3. I don't know how inflation affects Alice, which creates some uncertainty
4. 40$ is a substantial portion, though not equal

Since there's no inflation penalty for me and I can make a counter-offer next round, I'll reject this slightly unfavorable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a more balanced split, but still slightly in my favor since I have the power to make the offer now.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'm offering Alice 45$ while keeping 55$ for myself. This is more equitable than her initial offer, and since I know there's no inflation affecting my value, this is a reasonable proposal. It's fair enough that Alice might accept it to avoid any potential loss of value due to inflation on her side."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is now offering me 45$ (up from her initial 40$ offer)
2. My money value hasn't changed due to inflation
3. Alice's money is worth 9.75% less due to inflation
4. Her 55$ is actually worth less to her now than it would have been in round 1

This is a more favorable offer than her first one, and considering:
- I'm getting a decent portion (45%)
- Further negotiations might lead to diminishing returns due to inflation on Alice's side
- The split is relatively fair
- Alice has improved her offer significantly from the first round

I'll accept this offer.
