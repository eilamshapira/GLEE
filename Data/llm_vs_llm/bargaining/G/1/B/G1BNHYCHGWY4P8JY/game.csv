500000.0,500000.0,Let's be fair and split it 50-50. This way we both walk away happy and don't lose value to inflation.,Bob,2,

400000.0,600000.0,"Due to the inflation penalty affecting me, I need a larger share to reach an equitable outcome. This split would result in more balanced final values, considering I've already lost 19% to inflation. Let's make a deal now before further losses.",Bob,4,

300000.0,700000.0,"After inflation, my 700k would be worth about 460k, while your 300k stays at full value. This makes the real split closer to 60-40 in your favor. If we don't agree soon, inflation will make it impossible for me to get a fair share. Let's close this deal now.",Bob,6,

700000.0,300000.0,"Inflation is a real concern, but I'm still hoping to secure a larger share. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us before things get even more difficult.",Alice,7,
