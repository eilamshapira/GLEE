"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take the lion's share, but I'm willing to give you a small piece to start things off. Let's see how you feel about that. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Rationale (not part of response): The offer of $1,000 out of $1,000,000 is extremely unfair. Even with the 10% depreciation per round for Bob, there's room to negotiate for a much better deal. In the next round, I can make a counter-offer that's more equitable."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it 50-50. This way we both walk away happy and don't lose value to inflation.""}

Rationale (not part of response): I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split because:
1. It's an equitable division that's hard to argue against
2. With inflation affecting my gains each round, it's better to reach a fair agreement quickly
3. A 50-50 split is a strong anchor for future negotiations if Alice rejects
4. The message emphasizes fairness and the mutual benefit of quick agreement"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm still aiming for the majority. Let's see if we can reach an agreement before inflation eats away at our gains. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Rationale (not part of response): While Alice has increased the offer significantly from $1,000 to $100,000, it's still far from fair. Even with the 19% inflation penalty so far, rejecting $100,000 to negotiate for a better share is worth it. With my $100,000 being worth only $81,000 after inflation, and Alice offering just 10% of the total, there's still room for a much better deal. In the next round, I can propose something more reasonable, perhaps adjusting slightly from the 50-50 split to account for inflation pressure."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Due to the inflation penalty affecting me, I need a larger share to reach an equitable outcome. This split would result in more balanced final values, considering I've already lost 19% to inflation. Let's make a deal now before further losses.""}

Rationale (not part of response): I'm adjusting my strategy by:
1. Asking for 60-40 split to compensate for inflation losses
2. Making a logical argument about fairness considering the inflation penalty
3. Creating urgency by mentioning the ongoing inflation cost
4. Still keeping the offer reasonable enough that Alice might accept
5. The actual value I'd receive would be approximately $486,000 after the 19% inflation, which is closer to a fair split"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your need for a larger share due to inflation, but I'm still hoping for a significant majority. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Rationale (not part of response): While Alice has doubled her previous offer to $200,000, after the 34.39% inflation penalty, I would only receive about $131,220. This is still only 13.1% of the total value, which is far from fair. Even with increasing inflation pressure, it's worth one more attempt to negotiate a better deal. The significant increases in Alice's offers (from 1k to 100k to 200k) suggest she might be willing to move further toward a fair split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 700000, 
""alice_gain"": 300000, 
""message"": ""After inflation, my 700k would be worth about 460k, while your 300k stays at full value. This makes the real split closer to 60-40 in your favor. If we don't agree soon, inflation will make it impossible for me to get a fair share. Let's close this deal now.""}

Rationale (not part of response): I'm escalating my ask because:
1. With 34.39% inflation so far, $700k would actually be worth about $460k to me
2. This makes the real-value split much more balanced than it appears
3. The message emphasizes the reality of the inflation impact
4. Alice's previous offers show an upward trend in generosity
5. The urgency is real - if we go many more rounds, it will be impossible to reach a fair outcome
6. This could be our last chance at a mutually beneficial deal before inflation makes any split too unfavorable for me"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is a real concern, but I'm still hoping to secure a larger share. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us before things get even more difficult. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Rationale (not part of response): I'm accepting because:
1. With 46.86% inflation, my $300,000 would be worth about $159,420
2. If I reject, the next round would have 54% inflation, making it increasingly difficult to get a better real value
3. Alice has shown steady increases in offers (1k -> 100k -> 200k -> 300k)
4. We're more than halfway through the rounds, and the inflation penalty is becoming severe
5. While not ideal, this guarantees me a significant amount rather than risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds
6. Alice's offers suggest this might be close to her maximum concession"
