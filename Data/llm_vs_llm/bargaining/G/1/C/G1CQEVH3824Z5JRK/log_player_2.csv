While this offer is slightly better than Alice's first offer, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. Additionally, the inflation is starting to hurt, making each round increasingly costly for me. I need to push for a more equitable split soon."

The deal is getting worse for me with each round due to inflation. Alice's offer is now very close to an even split, and accepting this offer is better than risking getting a worse deal or even nothing as time runs out."
