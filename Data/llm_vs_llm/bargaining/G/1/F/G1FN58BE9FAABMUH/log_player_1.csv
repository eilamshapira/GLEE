"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for round 1, keeping in mind the potential for inflation:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

My reasoning: I'm starting with a proposal that favors me slightly, but leaves Bob with a reasonable amount. I hope this will be enough to entice him to accept, avoiding the value loss from inflation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the inflation. The $40 offered by Bob is worth 5% less to me than it would have been in round 1. That means it's worth $40 * 0.95 = $38 in round 1 dollars.

While I'm not thrilled with only $38 equivalent, it's still a significant amount. If I reject, the next round will see even more inflation for both of us. Let's assume I can get around $50 in value in the next round (in round 1 dollars). In that case, I would gain $50*0.95*0.95 = $45.125 in round 1 dollars. This amount is bigger than $38, so I'll reject.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, round 3. Inflation is really starting to bite. The money I gain is now worth 10% less than in round 1 (5% in round 2, and another 5% now). The money Bob gains is now worth 20% less than in round 1 (10% in round 2, and another 10% now).

To make this more palatable for Bob, I'll offer him slightly more than I asked for initially, considering the devaluation. I need to think in terms of round 1 dollars. If I want Bob to effectively receive $40 in round 1 money, I need to offer him $40 / 0.8 = $50 in round 3 money.

Therefore, my offer is:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 50,
""bob_gain"": 50
}
```"
