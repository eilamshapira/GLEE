"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's value of the money decreases by 20% each round, and it's now the 3rd round (2 rounds have passed), the money is worth 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 of its original value to Bob. 

To maximize my gain, I'll try to give Bob an amount that is equivalent to a smaller percentage of the original $10,000, considering its decreased value to him.
