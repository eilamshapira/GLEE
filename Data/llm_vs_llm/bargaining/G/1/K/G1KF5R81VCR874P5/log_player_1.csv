"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split that accounts for the different inflation rates we face. Since my money loses value faster (20% vs 10% per round), I should ask for a bit more to make it equitable.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I think this is a fair split considering the time pressure and different inflation rates we face. If we delay, both of us will lose value, but I lose more per round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. Even with the 20% inflation penalty, I'll get 60$ worth of value (75 * 0.8), which is better than my initial proposal. Given that future rounds will reduce the value further for both of us, and I lose value faster than Bob, it's smart to accept now."
