Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since your offer didn't reflect a fair split considering the rapid decrease in value for you, I propose $60 for me and $40 for you. This way, we both get a reasonable amount before the value drops further for you. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
