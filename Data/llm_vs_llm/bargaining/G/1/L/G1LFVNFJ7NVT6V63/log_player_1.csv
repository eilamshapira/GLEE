"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an initial offer that takes into account the different inflation rates we're both facing.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm proposing a split where I get $5,500 and you receive $4,500. Since your money loses value faster than mine (10% vs 5% per round), it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly rather than dragging this out through multiple rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4700 
# Bob gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll adjust my offer taking into account the inflation that's occurring with each round.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, 
""bob_gain"": 4800}

I'm proposing that I receive $5,200 and you get $4,800. This is a more balanced offer that accounts for our different inflation rates. Since your money depreciates at 10% per round compared to my 5%, it's increasingly in your interest to reach an agreement soon. This offer gives you a better outcome than extending the negotiation further."
