"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze this offer. I would get $4500 in the first round. If I reject it, the money will be worth 10% less to me in the next round. Let's calculate the value of $4500 to me after one round:

$4500 * 0.9 = $4050

If Alice proposes something worse than $4050 for me in the next round, I would have been better off accepting this offer. Also, since Alice is making the offer first, she likely is aiming for a higher payout for herself. If I reject this offer, I can make a better one for myself next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's my turn to make an offer. I need to consider that I want to maximize my gain while also ensuring Alice accepts. Since the money is worth less to both of us each round, a reasonable offer is important. I'll propose a split slightly in my favor, considering her discount is lower than mine.

{""bob_gain"": 5300, ""alice_gain"": 4700}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this offer from Alice in Round 3.

*   **Alice's offer:** I get $4800.

*   **Inflation impact:** My money is worth 19% less than in round 1. That means $1 is worth $0.81 to me. Therefore, $4800 is worth $4800 * 0.81 = $3888 to me *now*.

Let's consider if I reject, what might happen? I'd make an offer next round, and the money would be worth even less. Let's calculate the relative gains for both of us in round 1 versus in round 3, since this information might be helpful.

In round 1, $1 was worth $1 to both of us.

In round 3, for me $1 is worth $0.81, and for Alice $1 is worth $0.9025

The $4800 she is offering is more than $3888 and there is also a chance she will offer me less in the next round. I will accept this offer.
