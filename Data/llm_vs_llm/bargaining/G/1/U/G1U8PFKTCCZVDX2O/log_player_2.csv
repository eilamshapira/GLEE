"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the money so I get $550000 and you get $450000. This seems fair to me given the first-mover advantage. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $450,000 for me
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
   * The money will be worth 20% less to me
   * Maximum I could get would be $800,000 (if proposing 800k/200k split)
   * But with 20% inflation, that's effectively worth $640,000
   * And Alice might reject that anyway

The current offer of $450,000 is reasonable considering:
- It's a significant portion (45%)
- No inflation hit
- Guaranteed money if I accept
- Avoids the risk of further negotiations

While not perfectly equal, it's a decent offer and the inflation risk makes waiting risky.
