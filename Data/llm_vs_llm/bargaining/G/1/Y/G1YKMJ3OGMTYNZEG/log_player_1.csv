"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it equally. This way, neither of us risks losing value due to inflation in further rounds. It's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Since there's 10% inflation for me, if I accept this 50-50 split now:
- My $50 is actually worth $45 (due to 10% inflation)
- Bob's $50 maintains full value

If I reject and we go to the next round:
- I'll face another 10% inflation (making money worth 20% less)
- I could propose a higher split, but Bob might reject again
- The risk of further inflation could make me end up with even less

While this isn't ideal compared to my initial offer, getting $45 in real value now is better than risking further devaluation in future rounds.
