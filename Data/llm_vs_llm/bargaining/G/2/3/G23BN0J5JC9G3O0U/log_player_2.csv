"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. With $40 out of $100, I would get 40% of the total amount. While this isn't an even split, it's a reasonable first offer. However, if I reject:

1. I can make a counter-offer in the next round
2. The 10% inflation means my $40 would become worth $36 in the next round
3. There's a risk of further rounds reducing the value more
4. We have a limited number of rounds (12) to reach an agreement

Given these factors, while I could try to negotiate for more, the inflation penalty makes early agreement more valuable. The offer is good enough to avoid the risk of value loss.
