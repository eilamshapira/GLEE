6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob! Let's keep this simple and fair. I propose we divide it 60/40, with me getting $6000 and you getting $4000. This way we both get a great share. What do you think?",Alice,1,

7500.0,2500.0,"Alice, considering that if we continue the game both our shares lose value (with your next-round money being worth only 60% of face value and mine 80%), I propose we settle now. With my share at $2500 (effective $2250) and yours at $7500 (effective $6000), you get what you’d expect if you waited to make your own offer. I believe this is a fair proposal under the circumstances—let’s end the game quickly and avoid further losses.",Bob,2,
