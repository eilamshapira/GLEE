"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob! Let's keep this simple and fair. I propose we divide it 60/40, with me getting $6,000 and you getting $4,000. This way we both get a great share. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering that if we continue the game both our shares lose value (with your next-round money being worth only 60% of face value and mine 80%), I propose we settle now. With my share at $2500 (effective $2250) and yours at $7500 (effective $6000), you get what you’d expect if you waited to make your own offer. I believe this is a fair proposal under the circumstances—let’s end the game quickly and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
