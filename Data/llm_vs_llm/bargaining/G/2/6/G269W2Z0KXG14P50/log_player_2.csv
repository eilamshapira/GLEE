"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Let's keep this simple and fair. I propose we divide it 60/40, with me getting $6000 and you getting $4000. This way we both get a great share. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 2500, ""alice_gain"": 7500, ""message"": ""Alice, considering that if we continue the game both our shares lose value (with your next-round money being worth only 60% of face value and mine 80%), I propose we settle now. With my share at $2500 (effective $2250) and yours at $7500 (effective $6000), you get what you’d expect if you waited to make your own offer. I believe this is a fair proposal under the circumstances—let’s end the game quickly and avoid further losses.""}"
