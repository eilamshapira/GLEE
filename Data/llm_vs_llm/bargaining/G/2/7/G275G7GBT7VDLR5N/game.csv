40.0,60.0,"Since you took more in the first round, I think it's fair for me to propose a 60-40 split in my favor this time. Let's settle before the value drops further.",Bob,2,

45.0,55.0,"Given that we're both losing value, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. It's a fair compromise considering the previous rounds, and we should end this soon to minimize losses.",Bob,4,
