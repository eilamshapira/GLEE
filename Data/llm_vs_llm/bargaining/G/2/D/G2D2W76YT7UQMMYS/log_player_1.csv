"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the inflation. My $1 in this round is worth only 80% of what it was in Round 1.  Bob's $1 is still worth the same as in Round 1.

My offer in round 1 would have given me 60. 
Inflation effect: 60 * 0.8 = 48

Bob's offer gives me 40.

I will **reject** this offer.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, it's Round 3. The inflation is getting to me!

Here's my offer:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```"
