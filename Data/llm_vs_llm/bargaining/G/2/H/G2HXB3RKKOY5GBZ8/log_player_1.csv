"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to make a fair offer considering the inflation effect. Since I'll lose 20% value per round, I should aim for a reasonable initial offer.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest we split the money with me getting $55 and you getting $45. This is a fair distribution that gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging that if we continue to another round, the total value will decrease for me due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Bob's offer considering the inflation effect. In this round, any money I receive is worth 20% less than in round 1, while Bob's money is worth 10% less.

If I accept Bob's 50-50 split:
- I get $50, but with 20% inflation, it's effectively worth $40 to me
- Bob gets $50, with 10% inflation, it's worth $45 to him

If I reject and go to round 3, inflation will increase further, and I'll be making the next offer. However, the total value will decrease even more.

Given that this is a fair split in nominal terms and the inflation will only worsen if we continue, I should accept.
