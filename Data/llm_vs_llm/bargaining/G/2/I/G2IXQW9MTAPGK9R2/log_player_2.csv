"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which is perfectly fair and equitable. While I could try to negotiate for more in the next round, there's a risk that Alice might propose a less favorable split, and we only have 12 rounds to reach an agreement. A fair split is a good outcome, and there's value in securing a deal early.
