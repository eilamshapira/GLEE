"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

I'm being offered $300,000 out of $1,000,000, which is 30% of the total.

If I reject and we move to the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me. That means in the next round, the $1,000,000 will effectively be worth $800,000 to me. Even if I were to propose a better split for myself in the next round, I'm already at a disadvantage due to the higher inflation rate on my side.

Given that:
1. I face a higher inflation rate (20% vs Alice's 10%)
2. We have a limited number of rounds
3. This first offer gives me a significant portion

While I could try to negotiate for more, the inflation penalty makes rejection risky.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to make a strategic offer considering our different inflation rates. Since I face 20% inflation per round compared to Alice's 10%, time is more costly for me, which weakens my negotiating position.

In this round, the $1,000,000 is already worth 20% less to me, but only 10% less to Alice. I should propose a fair split that Alice would likely accept to avoid further rounds where I lose more value.

{""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""alice_gain"": 550000}

I'm proposing a more balanced split where I get $450,000 and Alice gets $550,000. This is more favorable to me than the previous offer while still giving Alice a majority, which acknowledges her stronger position due to the differential inflation rates."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this new offer:

I'm being offered $350,000 out of $1,000,000, which is 35% of the total. This is an improvement from Alice's first offer of $300,000.

Current inflation effects:
- For me: Money is worth 36% less than in round 1
- For Alice: Money is worth 19% less than in round 1

If I reject and we move to round 4:
- My inflation would increase further to approximately 49% (0.8^3)
- Alice's inflation would increase to approximately 27% (0.9^3)

Alice has improved her offer by $50,000 compared to round 1. Given the increasing inflation penalty I face and the fact that we have a limited number of rounds, this improved offer seems reasonable.

The effective value to me now is $350,000 Ã— 0.64 = $224,000, which is better than risking another round of negotiation where I would face even steeper inflation.
