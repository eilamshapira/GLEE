Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's keep it simple and fair with a 50/50 split. We both benefit equally this way. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 5% inflation, if I accept Bob's offer of $5000, it's actually worth $4750 to me due to inflation.

In the next round, I could propose again, but:
1. My share would be worth another 5% less due to inflation
2. Bob might reject again, leading to further rounds and more value loss

Bob's 50/50 offer is reasonable, and while I'm losing some value to inflation, continuing the negotiation could lead to even greater losses for me.
