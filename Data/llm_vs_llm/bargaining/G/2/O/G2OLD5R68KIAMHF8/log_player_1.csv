"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. I will act as Alice and make my first offer to Bob.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

My reasoning: I'm starting with a slightly favorable offer to me (60/40) in the first round. This gives Bob an incentive to accept, as he gets a guaranteed $40. I hope he doesn't want to risk losing money due to inflation and the time limit. I am aiming for a good starting position while leaving enough on the table for Bob to accept it immediately, without causing many more turns."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob has made a counter-offer. Let's analyze the situation:

*   **My perspective:**
    *   If I accept, I get $45, but it's worth 10% less, so it's effectively $45 * 0.9 = $40.50
*   **Bob's perspective:**
    * Bob gets $55, which is worth 5% less, so it's effectively $55 * 0.95 = $52.25

While Bob's offer is slightly better for him in absolute terms, the effective value is closer than the initial proposal. I also need to consider the time limit. Since this is round 2, I have 10 rounds left. It might be worth trying to get a slightly better deal.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, it's my turn to make an offer again. Remembering that inflation is still affecting me (10% per round for me, 5% for Bob), and also factoring in that there are only 10 rounds remaining, I need to make a decision that balances my desire for a larger share with the risk of getting nothing.

This round, my money is worth 20% less, whereas Bob's money is worth 10% less.

I will try to negotiate a little bit closer to the middle, but still leaning slightly in my favor, hoping to secure a deal before more value erodes away.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 53,
""bob_gain"": 47
}
```

Reasoning: I have decreased my ask and now ask for $53 while still offering Bob $47. Given the increased risk to us both from inflation, I hope this is an attractive offer to Bob. This should be an offer he finds hard to turn down, while still netting me a decent portion. I believe this is the right balance between aggressiveness and the risk of reaching the deadline."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze Bob's offer in Round 4.

*   **My perspective:**
    *   If I accept, I get $48, but it's worth 27.1% less, so it's effectively $48 * (1 - 0.271) = $48 * 0.729 = $34.992
*   **Bob's perspective:**
    *   Bob gets $52, which is worth 14.26% less, so it's effectively $52 * (1 - 0.1426) = $52 * 0.8574 = $44.5848

I am not happy with the offer. The inflation is hurting me significantly more than Bob. However, we're now in Round 4. If I reject, I have to make another offer. The chances of us reaching an agreement become smaller with each passing round and the amount of money that I end up actually receiving is dropping quite quickly with inflation.

I think I should try to propose something close to this offer in the next round.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, it's my turn again. This is getting tense. Given the increasing inflation, I need to secure a deal. Based on Bob's last offer, I will try to concede slightly, but not by much. This time I will try and close the deal as safely as possible.

My money is now worth 34.39% less, Bob's money is now worth 18.54% less.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 50,
""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

Reasoning: I'm offering a 50/50 split. I'm hoping this is enough to get Bob to accept and avoid further losses due to inflation. At this point, guaranteeing approximately $50 * (1 - 0.3439) = $32.8055 is better than risking getting nothing. Furthermore, I consider that I will only be able to ask for $48 in the next turn, so offering the current offer is clearly better. I will not continue for another turn."
