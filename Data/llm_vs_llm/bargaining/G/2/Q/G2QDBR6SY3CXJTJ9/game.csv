73.79,26.21,"Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $73.79 and you get $26.21. If you reject, you’ll get to propose next round—but remember that each round hurts the value of money on your side by about 20%, whereas my share’s value doesn’t diminish. With that discount in mind, this split is pretty reasonable. Let’s settle now rather than risk worse outcomes later!",Alice,1,

55.0,45.0,"Hi Alice, I understand we have different discount rates, but your initial offer was quite unbalanced. I'm proposing a more equitable split of $45 for me and $55 for you. This acknowledges your advantage in future rounds due to my time discount, but is much more reasonable than giving you nearly 3/4 of the total. If we continue to future rounds, both of us risk losing value. Let's settle on this fair compromise now.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but I believe we can do even better. I won't accept at the moment, so let's continue to round 3.",Alice,2,reject
54.0,46.0,"Hi Bob, as we know, every round past the first costs you a 20% hit on the cash value you receive. If we move past this round, you'll be stuck with that penalty when you propose, likely netting around $36 in effective terms. To avoid that loss, I'm proposing a split where you get $46 (worth 80% of $46, i.e. $36.8 effectively) and I keep $54. This way, you get even a little more than what waiting would guarantee, so let's settle now and avoid further devaluation!",Alice,3,
