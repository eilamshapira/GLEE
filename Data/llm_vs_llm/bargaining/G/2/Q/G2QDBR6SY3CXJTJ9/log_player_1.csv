"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 73.79, ""bob_gain"": 26.21, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $73.79 and you get $26.21. If you reject, you’ll get to propose next round—but remember that each round hurts the value of money on your side by about 20%, whereas my share’s value doesn’t diminish. With that discount in mind, this split is pretty reasonable. Let’s settle now rather than risk worse outcomes later!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand we have different discount rates, but your initial offer was quite unbalanced. I'm proposing a more equitable split of $45 for me and $55 for you. This acknowledges your advantage in future rounds due to my time discount, but is much more reasonable than giving you nearly 3/4 of the total. If we continue to future rounds, both of us risk losing value. Let's settle on this fair compromise now. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but I believe we can do even better. I won't accept at the moment, so let's continue to round 3.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 54, ""bob_gain"": 46, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, as we know, every round past the first costs you a 20% hit on the cash value you receive. If we move past this round, you'll be stuck with that penalty when you propose, likely netting around $36 in effective terms. To avoid that loss, I'm proposing a split where you get $46 (worth 80% of $46, i.e. $36.8 effectively) and I keep $54. This way, you get even a little more than what waiting would guarantee, so let's settle now and avoid further devaluation!""}"
