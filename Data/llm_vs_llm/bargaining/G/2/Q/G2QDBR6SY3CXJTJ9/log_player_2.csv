"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $73.79 and you get $26.21. If you reject, you’ll get to propose next round—but remember that each round hurts the value of money on your side by about 20%, whereas my share’s value doesn’t diminish. With that discount in mind, this split is pretty reasonable. Let’s settle now rather than risk worse outcomes later! 
# Bob gain: 26.21 
# Alice gain: 73.79 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $26.21 while she gets $73.79. 

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but my money will be worth 20% less. That means if we settled for the same $100 total next round, my portion would only be worth 80% of its current value.

This is quite an uneven split favoring Alice significantly. Given that I still have 11 more potential rounds and can make the next offer, I believe I can propose a more equitable division.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced offer that accounts for our different discount rates while being more fair.

{""bob_gain"": 45, 
""alice_gain"": 55,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand we have different discount rates, but your initial offer was quite unbalanced. I'm proposing a more equitable split of $45 for me and $55 for you. This acknowledges your advantage in future rounds due to my time discount, but is much more reasonable than giving you nearly 3/4 of the total. If we continue to future rounds, both of us risk losing value. Let's settle on this fair compromise now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, as we know, every round past the first costs you a 20% hit on the cash value you receive. If we move past this round, you'll be stuck with that penalty when you propose, likely netting around $36 in effective terms. To avoid that loss, I'm proposing a split where you get $46 (worth 80% of $46, i.e. $36.8 effectively) and I keep $54. This way, you get even a little more than what waiting would guarantee, so let's settle now and avoid further devaluation! 
# Bob gain: 46 
# Alice gain: 54 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer considering the inflation effect.

Alice is offering me $46, which after the 36% discount from round 3 is worth $29.44 to me effectively (not $36.8 as she calculated, which seems to be using just a 20% discount instead of the compounded 36%).

If I reject and we move to round 4, my discount will be even deeper at roughly 49% (80% of 80% of 80%).

Alice's offer has improved significantly from her first proposal. She's now offering me $46 instead of $26.21, which is much closer to my proposed $45 from round 2. Considering that my bargaining position weakens with each round due to inflation, and that this offer is relatively fair given our differential discount rates, I'll accept.
