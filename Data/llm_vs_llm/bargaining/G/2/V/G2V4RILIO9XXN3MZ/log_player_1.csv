Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm proposing a more balanced split. You get $5500 and I get $4500. This is fair considering we both face inflation, though mine is higher (20% vs. 10%). If we continue rejecting offers, we both lose value - let's make a reasonable deal now to maximize our total gain. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
