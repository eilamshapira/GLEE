"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you 2000. Take it or the game ends. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given Alice's offer, I need to consider the effects of inflation and the potential for a better outcome in future rounds.

In this offer:
- I (Bob) would receive $2,000
- Alice would receive $8,000

If I reject this offer, I'll make a counter-offer next round, but my money will be worth 20% less, while Alice's will be worth 10% less. That means I should only reject if I believe I can secure significantly more in the next round.

The offer of $2,000 is relatively low compared to the total of $10,000. Given that we have 12 rounds available and the asymmetric inflation rates actually favor me making an early deal (since my inflation rate is higher), I'll reject this offer to propose a more balanced split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer that acknowledges our situation with the different inflation rates.

{""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm proposing a more balanced split. You get $5,500 and I get $4,500. This is fair considering we both face inflation, though mine is higher (20% vs. 10%). If we continue rejecting offers, we both lose value - let's make a reasonable deal now to maximize our total gain.""}"
