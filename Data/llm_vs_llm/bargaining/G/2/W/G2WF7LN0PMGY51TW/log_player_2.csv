"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split this fairly. I'll take a bit more since I'm making the offer, but we both get a significant amount. What do you say, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice offers me $400,000 while taking $600,000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 20% inflation, my money would be worth 20% less next round
4. $400,000 now is better than potentially getting $500,000 next round (which would be worth $400,000 after inflation)
5. There's also risk in rejection as Alice might make worse offers later

Given the significant inflation penalty and the reasonable initial offer, I'll accept.
