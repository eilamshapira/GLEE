"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly. I'll take 60%, you get 40%. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that she takes 60% ($6,000) while I get 40% ($4,000). While this isn't an even split, I should consider that:

1. This is just the first round, so I have the option to counter-offer if I reject
2. The money doesn't lose value for me with inflation, but I'm not sure how inflation affects Alice
3. We have a limited number of rounds (12) to reach an agreement

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while acknowledging Alice's opener.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. Since we're both contributing equally to this negotiation, I propose a fair 50-50 split. This gives us each $5,000 and we can conclude the deal right away.""}"
