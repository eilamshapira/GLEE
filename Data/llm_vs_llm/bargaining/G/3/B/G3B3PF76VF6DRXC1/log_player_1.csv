"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a strategic first offer. Since Bob faces a 5% depreciation per round while I don't, I can use this to my advantage. However, I don't want to be too aggressive initially.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose this split because it's reasonable enough that Bob might accept it, considering that waiting will decrease the value of his share. The 60-40 split acknowledges that we both need to come to an agreement while giving me a slight advantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. Bob has offered me $45 while taking $55. I need to consider:

1. The money doesn't depreciate for me, so I don't lose value by waiting
2. Bob loses 5% value each round
3. We still have 10 rounds left
4. If Bob gets $55 now, it's worth more to him than if he gets it later

However, since I don't face any depreciation, I can afford to be patient and push for a better deal. I know that Bob's position weakens with each round due to the 5% depreciation. I can make a better offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob has rejected my initial 60-40 split and I rejected his 45-55 split, I'll adjust my offer slightly. Given that Bob's money is now worth about 10% less than in round 1, he should be more inclined to accept a slightly better offer than my first one.

{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}

I propose this split because:
1. Bob's $35 now is worth more than a larger amount in future rounds due to his 5% depreciation per round
2. It's still better for him to accept this than to drag the negotiation on and lose more value
3. I maintain a strong position since I don't face any depreciation"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Bob is offering me $48 now (same value as $48 in round 1 for me)
2. Bob's $52 is actually worth only about $44.58 to him (52 * 0.8574) due to the 14.26% depreciation
3. We still have 8 rounds left
4. Bob's position continues to weaken with each round
5. His offer has improved from his previous one ($45), but not enough

Since I don't lose any value by waiting and Bob's negotiating position weakens each round, I can still push for a better deal. The depreciation effect is starting to become significant for Bob, which should make him more willing to accept a more favorable split for me in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that Bob's money has already depreciated by about 14.26%, and will continue to depreciate, I'll make a stronger offer. Bob should be feeling more pressure to reach an agreement since his purchasing power continues to decrease with each round.

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I propose this split because:
1. Bob's $30 now is worth about $25.72 to him due to current depreciation
2. If he waits more rounds, any amount he gets will be worth even less
3. We're approaching the halfway point of our 12 rounds
4. I maintain my strong position with no depreciation
5. This is a logical progression from my previous offers, showing I'm firm in my negotiating position"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Bob is offering a 50-50 split
2. For me, I get $50 at full value
3. For Bob, his $50 is actually worth only about $38.69 (50 * 0.7738) due to the 22.62% depreciation
4. We have 6 rounds left
5. His offer has improved from $48 last time, but given the significant depreciation he faces, I believe I can still get a better deal

The fact that Bob is now offering a 50-50 split shows he's feeling pressure from the depreciation. However, since I don't face any depreciation pressure and his position continues to weaken, I can still hold out for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","With Bob's money now having depreciated by over 22%, and his last offer showing he's willing to move to a 50-50 split, I'll push for an even stronger position. The time pressure is mounting for Bob as his purchasing power continues to decline.

{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}

I propose this split because:
1. Bob's $25 now is worth only about $19.35 to him due to current depreciation
2. We're now in round 7 of 12, past the halfway point
3. Bob has shown flexibility by moving to a 50-50 offer, indicating he's feeling the pressure
4. Any further delays will make Bob's share worth even less to him
5. My position remains strong with no depreciation
6. This is still better for Bob than waiting several more rounds and getting a larger nominal amount that's worth less due to depreciation"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 52 
# Bob gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Bob is offering me $52 at full value
2. Bob's $48 is actually worth only about $33.52 to him (48 * 0.6983) due to the 30.17% depreciation
3. We have 4 rounds left
4. His offer has only improved by $2 from his last offer despite significant additional depreciation
5. The depreciation effect is now very substantial (over 30%)

Given that:
- Bob's negotiating position is significantly weaker now
- We still have 4 rounds left
- I don't lose any value by waiting
- Bob's money will depreciate even further in coming rounds
- His offer improvement is minimal despite his weakening position

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","With Bob's money now depreciated by over 30%, and only 3 rounds remaining after this one, I'll make a strong offer. The time pressure on Bob is intense as his purchasing power has significantly declined.

{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}

I propose this split because:
1. Bob's $20 now is worth only about $13.97 to him due to current depreciation
2. We only have 3 rounds left after this one
3. Bob has shown he's willing to move (offering me $52 last round)
4. Any further delays will make Bob's share worth even less to him
5. My position remains strong with no depreciation
6. With the severe depreciation and few rounds remaining, Bob should realize that accepting a smaller nominal amount now is better than waiting for a larger amount that will be worth even less to him
7. The threat of both of us getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds is becoming more relevant"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 54 
# Bob gain: 46 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation carefully:

1. Bob is offering me $54 at full value
2. Bob's $46 is worth only about $29 to him (46 * 0.6302) due to the 36.98% depreciation
3. We only have 2 rounds left after this one
4. His offer has improved by just $2 from his last offer
5. The risk of both getting nothing is becoming very real with only 2 rounds remaining

However:
- Bob's depreciation is now severe (nearly 37%)
- I still have the stronger position with no depreciation
- With two rounds left, I can still make one more offer and receive one more offer
- Bob's small incremental increases in offers suggest he might be willing to go higher

Given the remaining rounds and the severe depreciation Bob faces, I believe I can still get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","We're now in a critical position with only one round remaining after this one. The depreciation on Bob's side is severe (nearly 37%), and we must reach an agreement in the next two rounds or both get nothing. I need to make an offer that's strong but not so aggressive that Bob would prefer to risk the final round.

{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}

I propose this split because:
1. Bob's $15 now is worth only about $9.45 to him due to current depreciation
2. There's only one round left after this
3. The risk of getting nothing is very real now
4. Even this seemingly aggressive split gives Bob more real value than he might get by waiting for the final round where his money will be worth even less
5. It's still better for Bob to accept this than risk both of us getting nothing if we can't agree in the final round
6. The severe depreciation makes a smaller amount now more valuable than a larger amount in the final round"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 43.12% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","This is the final round - if I reject this offer, both of us get nothing. Let me analyze:

1. Bob is offering me $55 at full value
2. Bob's $45 is worth only about $25.60 to him (45 * 0.5688) due to the 43.12% depreciation
3. This is the last round - reject and we both get $0
4. His offer has improved slightly from his previous $54
5. Getting $55 is better than getting $0

While I was pushing for a higher split due to my stronger negotiating position, getting $55 is definitively better than getting nothing. The threat of mutual destruction is now immediate, and Bob's offer, while not as high as I hoped, is still reasonable given the circumstances.
