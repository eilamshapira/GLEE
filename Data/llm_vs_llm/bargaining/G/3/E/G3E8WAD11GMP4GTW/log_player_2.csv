"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to avoid any inflation risk, let's settle right away. I'm offering $550000 for myself and $450000 for you. I believe this is a fair split that rewards prompt agreement. Looking forward to your response! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $450,000 for me
2. If I reject and go to next round:
   * Money will be worth 5% less for me
   * Maximum I could propose would be $1,000,000 * 0.95 = $950,000
   * But Alice would likely reject an extremely unfair offer
   * And further delays would mean more value loss

The current offer of $450,000 is quite reasonable:
* It's a 45-55 split
* I avoid any inflation loss
* It's close enough to a fair 50-50 split
* The difference ($100,000) isn't worth risking value loss from inflation
