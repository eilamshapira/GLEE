"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I propose a 60/40 split.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering me 4000$ out of the 10,000$, which is 40% of the total. If I reject and we go to the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation. This means in the next round, the 10,000$ would only be worth 8,000$ to me.

If I make a counter-offer in the next round, even if I ask for more than 40%, I might end up with less actual value due to the inflation effect. For example, even if I managed to get 50% in the next round, that would be 5,000$ of a currency that's worth 20% less to me, so effectively 4,000$ in today's value.

Given the inflation risk and that 40% is a reasonable portion, I'll accept this offer.
