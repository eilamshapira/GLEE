"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering a fair split that slightly favors me since I face 10% inflation with each round. If we don't agree soon, we both lose value. This is a reasonable offer that gives you a substantial amount while acknowledging my time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice offers me $450,000 out of $1,000,000
2. If I reject, the next round my money will be worth 20% less
3. In round 2, the $1M would effectively be worth $800K for me
4. If I make a counter-offer, Alice might reject, leading to further losses
5. $450K now is better than a risky attempt to get more later with guaranteed value loss

The offer is reasonable given the circumstances. While not perfectly equal, the 45-55 split acknowledges our different inflation rates and the risk of further negotiations.
