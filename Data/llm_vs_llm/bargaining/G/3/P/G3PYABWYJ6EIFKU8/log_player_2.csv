"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me consider this offer. Alice is proposing:
- I get $450,000
- She gets $550,000

This is a 45%-55% split in Alice's favor. While not exactly equal, it's reasonably fair, especially considering we're in the first round and inflation will reduce the total value by 10% each round.

If I reject and counter-offer in round 2, we'd only be dividing $900,000 (after 10% inflation). Even if I proposed a more favorable split for myself, the total pie would be smaller.

I think this is a reasonable offer to accept early in the game.
