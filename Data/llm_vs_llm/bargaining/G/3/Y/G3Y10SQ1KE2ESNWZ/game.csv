400000.0,600000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we divide the $1000000 as follows: I take $400000 and you take $600000. Since I face a 20% devaluation in every subsequent round, Iâ€™d appreciate coming to an agreement now. I believe this split fairly recognizes the risks for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",Alice,1,

300000.0,700000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I think I can do better. Since I face a 10% devaluation in every subsequent round, I'd like to propose a 70-30 split in my favor. This still leaves you with a substantial amount, and I believe it's a fair trade considering the risks I'm taking on. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",Bob,2,
