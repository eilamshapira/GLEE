"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we divide the $1,000,000 as follows: I take $400,000 and you take $600,000. Since I face a 20% devaluation in every subsequent round, Iâ€™d appreciate coming to an agreement now. I believe this split fairly recognizes the risks for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I think I can do better. Since I face a 10% devaluation in every subsequent round, I'd like to propose a 70-30 split in my favor. This still leaves you with a substantial amount, and I believe it's a fair trade considering the risks I'm taking on. Let me know if this is acceptable to you. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
