"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we divide the $1000000 as follows: I take $400000 and you take $600000. Since I face a 20% devaluation in every subsequent round, Iâ€™d appreciate coming to an agreement now. I believe this split fairly recognizes the risks for both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 700000, 
""alice_gain"": 300000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I think I can do better. Since I face a 10% devaluation in every subsequent round, I'd like to propose a 70-30 split in my favor. This still leaves you with a substantial amount, and I believe it's a fair trade considering the risks I'm taking on. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.""}"
