"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I should make a fair offer to Bob, but also account for the fact that future rounds will cost me due to inflation. 

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing an equal split of the $100. This is a fair division that respects both of our interests, and I hope Bob will accept it so we can both walk away with a good outcome without having to deal with the 20% inflation penalty in future rounds."
