"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. With a 50-50 split, I would get $50. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me, meaning my $50 would only be worth $40. Even if I tried to get more in the next round, I'd need to get at least $62.50 just to equal the current value of $50.

Therefore, accepting this fair split now is better than risking a negotiation with depreciated value.
