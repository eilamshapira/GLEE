"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a strategic first offer, considering that Bob faces a 20% depreciation per round while I don't face any depreciation. This gives me some negotiating leverage.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. This is a reasonable first offer that gives Bob a substantial portion while still acknowledging my stronger position due to the asymmetric depreciation rates."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6800 
# Bob gain: 3200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
- Bob offers me $6,800, which is actually better than what I proposed ($6,000)
- Bob takes $3,200, which for him is worth only $2,560 due to 20% depreciation
- If I reject, we move to round 3 where I can make an offer, but Bob's portion will be worth even less to him
- This is actually a quite favorable offer for me

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept this offer. It's better than my initial proposal, and continuing the negotiation might risk the total value for both parties."
