"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  It's a reasonable starting point, considering I make the first offer. Let's avoid inflation eating into our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether this offer is fair or if I should counter-propose in the next round.

Alice is offering me 4500$ while keeping 5500$ for herself. If I reject and we go to another round, the total amount will decrease by 10% to 9000$. Even if I proposed a perfect 50/50 split next round, I would get 4500$ - exactly what I'm being offered now.

Given that we face inflation with each round, and my maximum gain from a counter-offer would likely be similar to what I'm already being offered, it makes sense to accept now.
