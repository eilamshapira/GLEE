"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I need to consider the actual value of the offer. 
The offer of $45 is now worth $45 * 0.8 = $36 to me.
Considering this, I think I can do better.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 20% less for me in each round. 
In round 1, the value was 100%.
In round 2, the value was 80% of the original.
In round 3, the value is 80% * 80% = 64% of the original.

To maximize my gain, I'll make an offer that favors me slightly, while still being reasonable for Bob.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each round, I calculate the actual value as follows:
Round 1: 100%
Round 2: 80%
Round 3: 64%
Round 4: 64% * 0.8 = 51.2% of the original value.

However, I was given that the money I gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, which seems inconsistent with the previous inflation rate. Assuming the correct inflation rate is applied, and the value is 51.2% of the original, I will proceed with this calculation.

The offer of $35 is now worth $35 * 0.512 = $17.92 to me.

Considering this, I think the offer is quite low, but I need to weigh it against the risk of further inflation in the next round.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 20% less for me in each round. 
In round 1, the value was 100%.
In round 2, the value was 80% of the original.
In round 3, the value is 80% * 80% = 64% of the original.
In round 4, the value is 64% * 0.8 = 51.2% of the original.
In round 5, the value is 51.2% * 0.8 = 40.96% of the original.

To maximize my gain, I'll make an offer that favors me slightly, while still being reasonable for Bob. Since the value of money is decreasing rapidly, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the inflation.
