"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","I should be strategic here, considering my objective to maximize my gains while accounting for the 10% inflation each round.

Alice's current offer gives me $10, which is quite low. If I reject and propose in the next round, I'll face a 10% inflation, but I can propose a more favorable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll now make a more balanced proposal. I need to consider that each round comes with 10% inflation for me, so waiting too long is costly. I'll propose a fair split that's more advantageous to me than her initial offer.

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which is reasonable given that Alice opened with a very unbalanced 10-90 split."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice has improved her offer slightly (from $10 to $20), but it's still quite low. However, I also see that inflation is affecting me significantly - I've already lost 19% of the value. I also now know that inflation doesn't affect Alice at all, which puts me at a disadvantage the longer we negotiate.

Given this information, if I reject again, the next round will have even more inflation for me, while Alice can wait with no cost. She seems to be using this advantage to offer me less than half of an equal split.

Even so, $20 is quite low. I'll reject and make another offer, but I need to be more accommodating now that I understand the asymmetric inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Now I understand that Alice has a significant advantage since inflation only affects me. This means I need to be more realistic with my offer, as waiting is costly only for me. I'll propose a more balanced split that acknowledges this power dynamic but still tries to secure a decent amount for myself.

{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55}

I propose a 45-55 split in Alice's favor. This acknowledges her stronger position due to the asymmetric inflation while still securing a reasonable amount for myself. If we continue negotiating, my effective gains will decrease with each round due to inflation."
