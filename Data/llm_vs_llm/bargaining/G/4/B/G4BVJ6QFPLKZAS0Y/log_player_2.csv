"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fairly balanced split where you get $450000 and I get $550000. Since money loses 20% value for you each round, if we delay, your share becomes worth much less. This offer gives you significant value now rather than risking further devaluation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me $450,000 out of the $1,000,000 (45%). She's correct that the money loses 20% value for me each round, while maintaining full value for her.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, my money will be worth 20% less. Even if I got a larger share in the next round, I'd need significantly more to make up for the devaluation.

For example, if I reject and aim for $600,000 next round, that would only be worth $480,000 to me due to the 20% devaluation ($600,000 * 0.8). And Alice might reject that offer anyway, leading to further rounds and more devaluation.

Given these circumstances, $450,000 in the first round is actually a fairly reasonable offer. It's less than half but avoids the significant risk of devaluation in later rounds.
