"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me make a strategic first offer, considering that future rounds will reduce the value for me due to 5% inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose getting $6,000 while giving Bob $4,000. This is a fair split considering I move first, but still gives Bob a substantial portion. If he rejects, the next round will be worth less to me due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Due to 5% inflation, if I accept this offer now:
   * I would get $4,500 Ã— 0.95 = $4,275 in round 1 value
   * Bob would get $5,500

2. If I reject:
   * I can make a new offer in round 3
   * But the money will be worth another 5% less to me
   * That's a 10% total reduction from original value

Since $4,275 is still a significant amount, and rejecting would mean even more value loss for me in the next round, I should accept this offer.
