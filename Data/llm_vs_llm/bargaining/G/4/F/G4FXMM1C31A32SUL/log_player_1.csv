"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split the $100 with me getting $55 and you getting $45. Accepting now helps us avoid the potential devaluation effects as rounds progress. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage and we can both walk away with a fair share. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the fair offer. Although the effective value for me is reduced this round, your even split is attractive given the further devaluation that Iâ€™d face if we delay more. I accept the proposal as is.""}"
