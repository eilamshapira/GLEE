"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Alice is offering me 6000$ and taking 4000$ for herself. This is a 60-40 split in my favor.

If I reject:
- The money will be worth 5% less for me in the next round (so $9,500 total value for me)
- It will be worth 20% less for Alice (so $8,000 total value for her)
- I'll get to make the next proposal

The current offer of $6,000 is quite reasonable, and with the significant depreciation rates (especially Alice's 20%), delaying might make it harder to reach an agreement. The 60-40 split is already in my favor.
