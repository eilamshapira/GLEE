Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a more equitable split. I propose 55/45, favoring me slightly due to the higher inflation rate I'm facing.  This allows us to both get a significant amount while minimizing the impact of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000
