0.0,10000.0,"Hi Bob, since every delay reduces my money’s value by 10% while yours remains intact, I’m in a tough spot. In any subgame‐perfect reasoning of our alternating‐offers game, my best proposal today is to give you the entire $10000 so that you’re indifferent between accepting now or waiting. I know this isn’t ideal for me, but I’d rather settle immediately than lose even more value. Let’s agree to this division and wrap up the game.",Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, I understand your concern about the 10% depreciation you face each round. However, taking everything isn't fair to you. I'm proposing that I get $5500 and you get $4500, which is a reasonably equitable split considering your disadvantage. If we go another round, your $4500 would be worth about $4050 to you, so this offer should be attractive compared to continuing negotiations. Let's settle on this fair division and end the game.",Bob,2,
