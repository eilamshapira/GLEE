"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 0, ""bob_gain"": 10000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, since every delay reduces my money’s value by 10% while yours remains intact, I’m in a tough spot. In any subgame‐perfect reasoning of our alternating‐offers game, my best proposal today is to give you the entire $10,000 so that you’re indifferent between accepting now or waiting. I know this isn’t ideal for me, but I’d rather settle immediately than lose even more value. Let’s agree to this division and wrap up the game.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about the 10% depreciation you face each round. However, taking everything isn't fair to you. I'm proposing that I get $5500 and you get $4500, which is a reasonably equitable split considering your disadvantage. If we go another round, your $4500 would be worth about $4050 to you, so this offer should be attractive compared to continuing negotiations. Let's settle on this fair division and end the game. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
