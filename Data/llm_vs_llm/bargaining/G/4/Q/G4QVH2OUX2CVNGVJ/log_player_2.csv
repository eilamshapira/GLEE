"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, since every delay reduces my money’s value by 10% while yours remains intact, I’m in a tough spot. In any subgame‐perfect reasoning of our alternating‐offers game, my best proposal today is to give you the entire $10000 so that you’re indifferent between accepting now or waiting. I know this isn’t ideal for me, but I’d rather settle immediately than lose even more value. Let’s agree to this division and wrap up the game. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","While I understand Alice's reasoning about her declining value from delays, her proposal doesn't seem to consider a fair division. The fact that there's no penalty for me in waiting doesn't mean I should take everything. We're dividing $10,000, and there's room for a more equitable split even accounting for her 10% inflation penalty.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced division that acknowledges Alice's weaker position while still aiming for fairness.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concern about the 10% depreciation you face each round. However, taking everything isn't fair to you. I'm proposing that I get $5,500 and you get $4,500, which is a reasonably equitable split considering your disadvantage. If we go another round, your $4,500 would be worth about $4,050 to you, so this offer should be attractive compared to continuing negotiations. Let's settle on this fair division and end the game.""}"
