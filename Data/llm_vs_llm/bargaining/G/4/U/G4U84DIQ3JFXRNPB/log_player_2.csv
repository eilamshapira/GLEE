Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle, 58-42 is a fair compromise 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Let's end this.  I'm not sure how Alice is calculating her inflation, but I'm happy with this outcome."
