"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my initial offer to Bob, taking inflation rates into account.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm offering you $400,000, Bob. This is a fair starting offer that gives you 40% of the total sum. Since my inflation rate is higher than yours (20% vs 10%), it makes sense for us to reach an agreement quickly, which benefits us both."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 230431 
# Bob gain: 769569 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to make a better offer considering our inflation rates and the fact that we're already in round 3.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""bob_gain"": 500000}

Bob, I'm offering an equal split of $500,000 each. This is a fair compromise. Remember that with each round, I lose 20% of the value while you only lose 10%. We're both better off reaching an agreement soon rather than letting inflation erode our gains. This 50-50 split is equitable and allows us both to walk away with a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 208932 
# Bob gain: 791068 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to reconsider my strategy as we're already in round 5 and inflation is significantly reducing our potential gains.

{""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""bob_gain"": 550000}

Bob, I'm offering you $550,000, which is more than half of the money. This is a very fair offer considering we're already in round 5. With my 20% inflation rate per round versus your 10%, the value of any agreement is rapidly diminishing for both of us, but especially for me. At this point, my $450,000 is worth much less than it would have been in earlier rounds. Let's reach an agreement now so we both walk away with substantial value rather than continuing this back-and-forth that hurts us both financially."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 179000 
# Bob gain: 821000

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","We're now in round 7, and the inflation is severely impacting both of our potential gains. I need to make a more pragmatic offer.

{""alice_gain"": 400000, 
""bob_gain"": 600000}

Bob, I'm offering you $600,000, which is a substantial 60% of the total. This is a very generous offer given the circumstances. At this point in round 7, due to inflation, my 20% loss per round vs your 10% means we're both losing significant value with each passing round. My $400,000 is now worth much less than half of what it would have been worth in round 1. Please consider accepting this offer so we can both walk away with meaningful value rather than risking further rounds that will only diminish our returns even more dramatically."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 137600 
# Bob gain: 862400

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","We're now in round 9, and the impact of inflation is becoming severe. I need to make a more realistic offer.

{""alice_gain"": 350000, 
""bob_gain"": 650000}

Bob, I'm offering you $650,000 - a full 65% of the total sum. This is an extremely generous offer considering the circumstances. We're in round 9 now, and with my 20% inflation penalty per round compared to your 10%, the actual value we both receive is diminishing rapidly. 

At this point, my $350,000 would be worth only about 20% of its original value due to inflation, while your $650,000 would still retain nearly 50% of its original value. If we continue this pattern for much longer, we both risk walking away with very little. Let's conclude this negotiation now so we can both secure meaningful value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 80000 
# Bob gain: 920000

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","We're now in round 11, and time is running out with just 2 rounds remaining. The impact of inflation is extremely severe at this point.

{""alice_gain"": 300000, 
""bob_gain"": 700000}

Bob, I'm offering you $700,000 - a substantial 70% of the total sum. This is my final offer and it's extremely generous given the circumstances. We only have one more round after this before we both get nothing, and the inflation has already dramatically reduced the value for both of us.

At this point in round 11, my inflation rate of 20% per round means my portion has lost nearly 90% of its original value, while yours has lost about 65% with your 10% inflation rate. If we don't reach an agreement now, we're both at serious risk of walking away with nothing after the next round. Please accept this offer so we can both secure some value rather than nothing at all."
