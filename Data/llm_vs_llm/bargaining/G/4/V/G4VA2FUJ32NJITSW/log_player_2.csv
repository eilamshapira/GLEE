"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With a 50-50 split ($500,000 each), this seems fair at first glance. However, considering:

1. If I reject, I can make my own offer next round
2. The 5% inflation penalty means if I reject, my next round's dollars will be worth 5% less
3. But Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation
4. We have 12 rounds total before we both get nothing

Given the inflation risk and the fact that this is a reasonably fair offer, I think it's best to accept now rather than risk getting less value in future rounds.
