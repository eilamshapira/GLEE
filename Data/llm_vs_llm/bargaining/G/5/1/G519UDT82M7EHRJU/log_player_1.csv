"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. It's round 1, I'm Alice, and I need to make an offer to Bob. I need to be mindful of the rapidly decreasing value of the money to me.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a substantial amount. This increases the likelihood of acceptance, especially in the early rounds.
*   I'm keeping $600,000 for myself. This gives me a good initial gain and accounts for the rapidly approaching inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob rejected my initial offer and has now made a counter-offer. Let's analyze this:

*   **Bob's Offer:** Bob is offering me $450,000.
*   **Inflation:** The money is worth 10% less to me than in round 1.

Here's how I'll evaluate the offer:

*   My initial offer was $600,000.
*   Bob is offering $450,000.
*   The current value of $450,000 is about $405,000 (450,000*.90= 405,000) from Round 1.

I will reject this offer.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, it's Round 3. The pressure is on! Remember the money is worth 20% less to me this round than round 1.

Here's my offer to Bob:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   **Increased Alice's Share:** I'm increasing my share to $650,000. The money is decaying fast for me, so I need to secure more of it.
*   **Reduced Bob's Share:** I'm decreasing Bob's share to $350,000. This might be risky, but I need to compensate for the value lost in previous rounds. I am betting that the risk of getting nothing will make Bob accept this lower offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob rejected my offer again. Now, Bob's offering me $420,000, and the money's value has plummeted significantly, with a 27.1% reduction compared to Round 1.

Calculating the real value of Bob's offer: $420,000 * (1 - 0.271) = $420,000 * 0.729 = $306,180 in Round 1 dollars.

This is a terrible offer, so I'm going to reject it.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, it's Round 5, and the money is losing value fast.

Here's my offer to Bob:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 700000,
""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   **Alice's Share Increased Again:** I'm increasing my share to $700,000. Given the inflation, I need to grab as much as I can to make this worthwhile.
*   **Bob's Share Reduced Further:** I'm reducing Bob's share to $300,000. It's a gamble, but the threat of losing everything should be looming large for both of us by now. I'm hoping Bob is getting desperate enough to accept. This might be the best offer Bob can get."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alright, Bob's rejected my offer again. Now he's offering me $400,000, but the money is worth a whopping 40.95% less than in the first round.

Let's calculate the real value: $400,000 * (1 - 0.4095) = $400,000 * 0.5905 = $236,200 in Round 1 dollars.

This is an extremely low offer after all this time. I am going to reject.

```json

""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, Round 7. This is getting critical. The inflation is killing me.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 750000,
""bob_gain"": 250000
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   **Aggressive Offer:** I'm pushing for $750,000. At this point, securing a larger portion now is more important than maximizing potential gains over time, which is almost entirely eroded by inflation.
*   **Risky Reduction for Bob:** Bob gets $250,000. This is a lowball, but I'm betting that the desperation of getting something rather than nothing will be the deciding factor. If Bob is rational, they have to accept this, otherwise they will get nothing!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 380000 
# Bob gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob rejected my offer *again*. Now he's offering me $380,000, but the money is worth a disastrous 52.17% less than in Round 1.

Let's calculate the real value: $380,000 * (1 - 0.5217) = $380,000 * 0.4783 = $181,754 in Round 1 dollars.

This is abysmal. I will reject.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, this is Round 9. We are getting dangerously close to the deadline.

Given the rapid inflation eating away at the value, I'm going to stick to a strategy of claiming a significant portion now to salvage something.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 800000,
""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   **Take as Much as Possible:** I'm increasing my share to $800,000. Inflation is a killer.
*   **Hope for Desperation:** Bob gets a mere $200,000. It's a very risky offer, but with only a few rounds left, I'm hoping the threat of losing everything will force Bob's hand. At this point, it is better than nothing for Bob. This has to work!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 360000 
# Bob gain: 640000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob rejected again. He's now offering me $360,000, but it's worth only 61.26% of its initial value.

Let's calculate the real value: $360,000 * (1 - 0.6126) = $360,000 * 0.3874 = $139,464 in Round 1 dollars.

This is pathetic. It's an insult, really. I'm rejecting it.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, this is Round 11! We're almost out of time. I have to make a Hail Mary offer.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 900000,
""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   **All or Nothing:** I'm demanding $900,000. The inflation is catastrophic.
*   **Tiny Slice for Bob:** Bob gets a measly $100,000. It's insulting, but it's *something*. I'm banking on Bob being utterly desperate and realizing this is the only way to avoid getting absolutely nothing. He HAS to accept this. If he doesn't, we both lose everything. There is a chance that Bob doesn't understand the inflation effect. If Bob understands the inflation, he must accept this."
