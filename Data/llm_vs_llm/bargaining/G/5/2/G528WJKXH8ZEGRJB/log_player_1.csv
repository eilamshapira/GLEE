"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair proposal to divide the $1,000,000, considering that if Bob rejects, we both lose value due to the 10% inflation penalty.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose an equal 50-50 split. This is fair to both of us, and we can both walk away with significant value without risking the 10% depreciation that would occur if we move to another round."
