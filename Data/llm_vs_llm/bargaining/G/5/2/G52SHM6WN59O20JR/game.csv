444444.0,555556.0,"Alice, to avoid further losses from inflation, I'm proposing that we split the $1000000 now. Considering that any delay reduces the overall value, my offer—$555556 for me and $444444 for you—represents the fair division we can expect if you had the chance to propose next round. Please accept this proposal so that we both secure as much value as possible.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, considering the inflation and your last offer, I've sweetened the deal a little. Let's get this done and dusted before the value drops even further!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
672000.0,328000.0,"Alice, I know we both want as much of the value as possible before further devaluation hits. If you reject, you'll propose in Round 5—but then the total pot will be worth only 40.96% of its original value, and even as proposer you can't secure an effective payoff higher than about 344064. My offer here gives you a nominal 672000, which is worth 672000 × 0.512 ≈ 344064 in today’s terms. I’m offering you exactly what you’d expect to get if you waited, so please accept and let’s avoid further losses.",Bob,4,
