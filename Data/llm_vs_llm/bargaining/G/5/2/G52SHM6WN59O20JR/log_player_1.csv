Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, to avoid further losses from inflation, I'm proposing that we split the $1000000 now. Considering that any delay reduces the overall value, my offer—$555556 for me and $444444 for you—represents the fair division we can expect if you had the chance to propose next round. Please accept this proposal so that we both secure as much value as possible. 
# Alice gain: 444444 
# Bob gain: 555556 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know we both want as much of the value as possible before further devaluation hits. If you reject, you'll propose in Round 5—but then the total pot will be worth only 40.96% of its original value, and even as proposer you can't secure an effective payoff higher than about 344064. My offer here gives you a nominal 672000, which is worth 672000 × 0.512 ≈ 344064 in today’s terms. I’m offering you exactly what you’d expect to get if you waited, so please accept and let’s avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 672000 
# Bob gain: 328000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
