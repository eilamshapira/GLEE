Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split this fairly, Bob. I think this is a reasonable division. Accept and let's both walk away happy!

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 555556, ""alice_gain"": 444444, ""message"": ""Alice, to avoid further losses from inflation, I'm proposing that we split the $1,000,000 now. Considering that any delay reduces the overall value, my offer—$555,556 for me and $444,444 for you—represents the fair division we can expect if you had the chance to propose next round. Please accept this proposal so that we both secure as much value as possible.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering the inflation and your last offer, I've sweetened the deal a little. Let's get this done and dusted before the value drops even further! 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 328000, ""alice_gain"": 672000, ""message"": ""Alice, I know we both want as much of the value as possible before further devaluation hits. If you reject, you'll propose in Round 5—but then the total pot will be worth only 40.96% of its original value, and even as proposer you can't secure an effective payoff higher than about 344,064. My offer here gives you a nominal 672,000, which is worth 672,000 × 0.512 ≈ 344,064 in today’s terms. I’m offering you exactly what you’d expect to get if you waited, so please accept and let’s avoid further losses.""}"
