"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer to Bob for dividing the $1,000,000.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose we split the money with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. I'm offering this slightly higher split for myself because I face a 10% inflation penalty with each round, while Bob doesn't lose value by waiting. This offer gives both of us a substantial amount and avoids delays that would reduce the overall value I receive."
