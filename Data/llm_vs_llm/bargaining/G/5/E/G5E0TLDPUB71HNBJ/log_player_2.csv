Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try a 70/30 split. While I value fairness, I also have to be mindful of the declining value of our share over time. This compromise should be beneficial for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000
