"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a reasonable first offer, aiming for a fair split but slightly in my favor.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose taking $5,500 for myself and giving $4,500 to Bob. This is a relatively fair split that gives Bob a significant portion while maintaining a small advantage for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
- Bob is offering me $4,800 and keeping $5,200 for himself
- Due to inflation, Bob's $5,200 is actually worth 5% less, so it's equivalent to $4,940 in round 1 value
- My $4,800 maintains its full value since inflation doesn't affect me
- This is a reasonable offer, though slightly in Bob's favor
- If I reject, we'll move to round 3, and further inflation will affect Bob's portion
- Given we have limited rounds and this is a decent offer, I should accept
