"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering me $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for herself. Let me consider this:

If I reject, we move to round 2 where I make an offer, but our money will be worth less due to inflation (5% less for me, 10% less for Alice).

For me: $400,000 now vs. making a counter-offer when the money is worth 5% less
For Alice: $600,000 now vs. potentially receiving a counter-offer when money is worth 10% less to her

This isn't a terrible offer, but I believe I can propose a more favorable split in the next round, given that Alice faces higher inflation pressure than I do.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer that takes into account our different inflation rates. Since Alice's money depreciates faster (10% per round vs my 5%), she has more incentive to reach an agreement quickly.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I think this is a fair offer considering our different inflation rates. If Alice rejects this, we'll both experience additional depreciation, but hers will be more significant than mine."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me evaluate Alice's new offer:

Alice is offering me $475,000, which is worth 9.75% less than in round 1, so the actual value to me is approximately $428,688.

If I reject and we go to round 4, my money would depreciate by another 5% (totaling about 14.75% from round 1), and Alice's would depreciate by another 10% (totaling about 29% from round 1).

This offer is substantially better than her first offer of $400,000, and the inflation penalty is becoming significant. If I reject now, Alice's incentive to offer me more will increase due to her higher inflation rate, but I also risk losing more value.

Given that this is a reasonable improvement from round 1 and close to a 50-50 split, I'll accept.
