"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a fair 50-50 split. This ensures we both walk away with a good amount, and we don't risk losing everything by going through many rounds. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer of a 50-50 split.

If I accept now, I get $5,000.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2, I'll face a 5% inflation penalty. This means even if I got the entire $10,000 in round 2, it would only be worth $9,500 to me. If I proposed a more favorable split like 70-30 ($7,000 for me), the $7,000 would be worth $6,650 after inflation.

Since inflation compounds with each round, and we have a limit of 12 rounds, it's better to secure a fair amount now rather than risk further devaluation or potentially getting nothing.
