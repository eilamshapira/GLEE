"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to account for the decreasing value of the money for both of us. I'll start with a relatively generous offer to increase the likelihood of acceptance and avoid further devaluation.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the current value of the money for me. My money is worth 5% less than before. Bob's offer is $50.

If I accept, I get $50.
If I reject, I will make another offer, but the value will decrease by another 5%.

I will accept this offer.
