"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer would give me $40, which is less than half of the total amount. Given that I'm facing a slightly higher inflation rate than Alice (10% vs 5%), it might be better for me to make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair counteroffer considering our different inflation rates.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I propose we split the money equally. This is a fair division that gives us both the same amount, and allows us to finish the game early before inflation reduces the value for both of us."
