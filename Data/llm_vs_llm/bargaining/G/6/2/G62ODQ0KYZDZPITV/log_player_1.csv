"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an initial offer to Bob, considering the different inflation rates affecting us.

{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}

I propose this division because while we both face inflation, Bob's inflation rate is significantly higher at 20% compared to my 5%. This means Bob has a stronger incentive to conclude the deal sooner rather than waiting for future rounds. My offer gives him a substantial portion while recognizing that I have a somewhat stronger negotiating position due to the different inflation rates."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I notice that Bob is taking a fairly aggressive stance despite his higher inflation rate. Let me adjust my offer to find a middle ground that acknowledges our respective positions.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering Bob a significantly better deal than my first proposal. Since we're now in round 3, Bob faces 40% cumulative inflation on his gains if we were to conclude in the next round, while I only face 10% on mine. This adjusted offer gives Bob a strong incentive to accept rather than continuing to future rounds where his potential gains will be worth even less due to his higher inflation rate."
