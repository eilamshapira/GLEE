"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair first offer considering the inflation risk that affects me but not Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable split given that if Bob rejects and we go to further rounds, my share will be worth less due to inflation while his won't be affected."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. If I accept Bob's offer of $40, due to 20% inflation in round 2, it would actually be worth $32 to me. Bob's $60 remains worth $60 to him.

This is not a good deal for me. If I reject and make a new offer in round 3, I'll face 40% total inflation, but I might be able to negotiate a better split. Even with that inflation, getting $50 in round 3 would be worth $30 to me, similar to accepting this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that we're now in round 3, and my gains are subject to 40% inflation, I need to propose a higher nominal amount for myself to achieve a fair effective value.

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I propose I get $70 and Bob gets $30. Due to the 40% inflation affecting my share, the $70 would actually be worth $42 to me, while Bob's $30 remains worth $30 to him. This makes it a more balanced effective split, and Bob should understand that the higher nominal amount for me is justified by the inflation penalty I'm facing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
* Bob offers me $45, but with 48.8% inflation, it would be worth only $23.04 to me
* Bob gets $55, which is worth the full $55 to him
* If I reject, we go to round 5 where my money will be worth 59.04% less
* Getting even $80 in round 5 would only be worth $32.77 to me

Given the rapidly increasing inflation and the fact that Bob's offer gives me a somewhat reasonable amount, it's better to accept now than risk further devaluation of my share.
