"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60/40 split. Let's finish this now and both walk away with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get 400,000$ and she gets 600,000$. If I reject and we move to the next round, I'll face a 20% inflation penalty, meaning my money will be worth less.

Let me calculate what happens if I reject:
- In round 2, the money would be worth 20% less to me
- If I propose a 50/50 split in round 2, that would give me 500,000$ but with 20% inflation, it's effectively worth 400,000$ to me
- Even if I ask for more in round 2, Alice might reject

Given the significant inflation penalty I face and the fact that 400,000$ is a substantial amount, I'll accept this offer.
