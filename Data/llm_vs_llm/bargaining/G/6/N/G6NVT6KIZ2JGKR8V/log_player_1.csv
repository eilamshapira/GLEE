"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split where I get slightly more since I'm making the first offer. This way we can both walk away with a substantial amount without risking inflation losses.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this evenly.  It's the fairest and safest way to ensure we both get a good amount before inflation bites. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this... The offer is a 50-50 split, but due to 5% inflation, my $500,000 is actually worth $475,000 to me now. While this is less than my initial proposal, rejecting might lead to even worse outcomes due to:
1. Further inflation losses in future rounds
2. Risk of getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds
3. Uncertainty about Bob's future offers

A guaranteed $475,000 (in round 1 value) is still a substantial amount, and the risk of getting a worse deal later is significant.
