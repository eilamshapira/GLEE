"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split, considering I need to make it attractive enough for Bob to accept rather than move to the next round where inflation will hurt me.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this division where I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. This gives me a slight advantage but is fair enough that Bob might accept rather than risk a worse outcome in subsequent rounds."
