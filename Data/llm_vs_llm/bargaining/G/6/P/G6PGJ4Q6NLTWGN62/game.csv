614776.0,385224.0,"Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for round 1: I’ll take $614776 and you get $385224. Accepting now guarantees you an effective value of $385224 today—better than risking further rounds where inflation eats away at your share (20% per round). Let’s agree now and both walk away with value, rather than losing out by waiting.",Alice,1,
