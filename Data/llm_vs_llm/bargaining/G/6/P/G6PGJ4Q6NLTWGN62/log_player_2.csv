"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for round 1: I’ll take $614776 and you get $385224. Accepting now guarantees you an effective value of $385224 today—better than risking further rounds where inflation eats away at your share (20% per round). Let’s agree now and both walk away with value, rather than losing out by waiting. 
# Bob gain: 385224 
# Alice gain: 614776 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's offer considering the different inflation rates we face.

If I reject now and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total pot will be worth 20% less to me but only 10% less to Alice. This significant difference in inflation rates means delays hurt me more than her.

While a 38.5%/61.5% split isn't ideal, waiting a round would mean I'd need to secure at least $481,530 ($385,224 ÷ 0.8) just to break even on today's value. That's already 48.1% of the next round's pot, and Alice knows this.

Given our asymmetric inflation rates and the risk of getting nothing after 12 rounds, accepting this first offer might be the prudent choice.
