"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split of the total amount. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. 

Alice is offering me $500,000 out of the $1,000,000, which is 50% of the total. However, I should remember that I face a 5% inflation penalty per round, while Alice doesn't face any inflation.

If I reject and propose in round 2, the money will be worth 5% less to me, meaning each dollar would be worth 0.95 of its original value. This means that if I want to achieve the same effective value as the current $500,000 offer, I would need to secure about $526,316 in the next round ($500,000 รท 0.95).

Given that this is a fairly reasonable opening offer of 50%, and considering my disadvantage with inflation, I'll accept.
