487179.0,512821.0,"Alice, I value our time and understand that money loses value with delay. To reflect our mutual sensitivity to inflation, I'm proposing a division that, for both of us, is fair given our current positions. I would receive $512821 (in nominal dollars, which for me is slightly discounted at this round) and you would receive $487179. I believe this offer captures our shared urgency and benefits us both by avoiding further devaluation. Please accept this proposal.",Bob,2,
