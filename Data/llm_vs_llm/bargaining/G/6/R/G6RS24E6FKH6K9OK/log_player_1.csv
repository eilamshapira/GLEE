"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I value our time and understand that money loses value with delay. To reflect our mutual sensitivity to inflation, I'm proposing a division that, for both of us, is fair given our current positions. I would receive $512821 (in nominal dollars, which for me is slightly discounted at this round) and you would receive $487179. I believe this offer captures our shared urgency and benefits us both by avoiding further devaluation. Please accept this proposal. 
# Alice gain: 487179 
# Bob gain: 512821 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
