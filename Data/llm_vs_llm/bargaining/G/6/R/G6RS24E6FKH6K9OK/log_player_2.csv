"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 512821, ""alice_gain"": 487179, ""message"": ""Alice, I value our time and understand that money loses value with delay. To reflect our mutual sensitivity to inflation, I'm proposing a division that, for both of us, is fair given our current positions. I would receive $512,821 (in nominal dollars, which for me is slightly discounted at this round) and you would receive $487,179. I believe this offer captures our shared urgency and benefits us both by avoiding further devaluation. Please accept this proposal.""}"
