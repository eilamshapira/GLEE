"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer. She's proposing a 50-50 split with $5,000 for each of us. 

This is a fair split, but I need to consider the inflation effect. If I reject and propose in the next round, the total value to me would be reduced by 10%. If I make a better proposal next round and Alice accepts, I might gain more than $5,000, but if negotiations drag on, inflation will reduce the final value.

Since this is the first round and the offer is already fair, accepting seems reasonable rather than risking value loss through inflation.
