,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Since money loses 10% value each round for you but not for me, this split actually gives you more value than waiting another round. If we went to a third round, even a 50-50 split would only be worth $4500 to you due to your 10% inflation penalty. This is a fair offer considering our different situations.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Bob, considering the inflation impact on my side, I'm proposing a 45-55 split in your favor. This offer still gives you more than half while ensuring I get a reasonable amount given the decreasing value of money for me. Let's end this on a fair note.",Alice,3,
