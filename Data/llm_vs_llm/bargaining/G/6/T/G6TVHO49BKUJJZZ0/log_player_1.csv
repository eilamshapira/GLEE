"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Since money loses 10% value each round for you but not for me, this split actually gives you more value than waiting another round. If we went to a third round, even a 50-50 split would only be worth $4500 to you due to your 10% inflation penalty. This is a fair offer considering our different situations. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Bob, considering the inflation impact on my side, I'm proposing a 45-55 split in your favor. This offer still gives you more than half while ensuring I get a reasonable amount given the decreasing value of money for me. Let's end this on a fair note.""
