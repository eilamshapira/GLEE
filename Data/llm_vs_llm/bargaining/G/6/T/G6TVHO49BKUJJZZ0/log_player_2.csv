"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we both benefit equally. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer carefully.

Alice is proposing an even split of $5,000 for each of us. While this appears fair on the surface, I need to consider the different discount rates we have.

For me (Bob), there's no inflation penalty - money maintains its full value in future rounds.

For Alice, money loses 10% of its value each round. This means if we move to the next round, any amount she receives will be worth 10% less to her.

Given this asymmetry, I can potentially negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round, as waiting is more costly for Alice than for me.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I need to make a strategic offer that accounts for our different inflation rates. Since money devalues 10% each round for Alice but not for me, I have a negotiating advantage.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, 
""alice_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Since money loses 10% value each round for you but not for me, this split actually gives you more value than waiting another round. If we went to a third round, even a 50-50 split would only be worth $4,500 to you due to your 10% inflation penalty. This is a fair offer considering our different situations.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering the inflation impact on my side, I'm proposing a 45-55 split in your favor. This offer still gives you more than half while ensuring I get a reasonable amount given the decreasing value of money for me. Let's end this on a fair note. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me evaluate this offer carefully.

Alice is now offering me $5,500 (55% of the total) while she takes $4,500 (45%). This is an improvement from the initial 50-50 split she proposed.

I need to consider what might happen in future rounds:
- For me, money maintains its full value
- For Alice, money has already lost 19% of its value in this round
- If we go to another round, Alice's money would lose approximately 27% of its original value

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 4, Alice might be willing to accept an even better deal for me. However, there's also risk she could reject again, and we'd end up in a situation with diminishing returns.

Given that Alice has already moved significantly in my favor (from 50-50 to 45-55), and this is a reasonable offer considering our different inflation positions, I'll accept.
