"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split that accounts for potential future inflation if negotiations continue. Since I know I'll lose 5% value each round if Bob declines, I'll offer slightly more to Bob to encourage acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 4800, ""bob_gain"": 5200}

This division gives Bob a slight advantage to incentivize immediate acceptance, while still securing a reasonable amount for myself. If Bob declines and we go to the next round, my potential gains would be reduced by inflation."
