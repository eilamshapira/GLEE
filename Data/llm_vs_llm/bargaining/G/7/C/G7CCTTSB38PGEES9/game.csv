73.79,26.21,"Hi Bob, I propose a split where I receive $73.79 and you receive $26.21. If you reject, you'll have the chance to propose next roundâ€”but remember that waiting costs you (your dollars lose 20% in value each round). Accepting now guarantees you $26.21 in full value. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?",Alice,1,

50.0,50.0,"Hi Alice, I suggest a fair 50-50 split. While I understand you tried to leverage the inflation penalty against me, an equal division respects both our interests. Even with the 20% inflation affecting me, this is still better than your initial offer. A 50-50 split is the standard fair solution in these scenarios.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, I accept your 50/50 split offer. Receiving $50 now is better for me than risking a lower payoff in future rounds. Thanks!",Alice,2,accept
