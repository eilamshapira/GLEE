"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 73.79, ""bob_gain"": 26.21, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a split where I receive $73.79 and you receive $26.21. If you reject, you'll have the chance to propose next roundâ€”but remember that waiting costs you (your dollars lose 20% in value each round). Accepting now guarantees you $26.21 in full value. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I suggest a fair 50-50 split. While I understand you tried to leverage the inflation penalty against me, an equal division respects both our interests. Even with the 20% inflation affecting me, this is still better than your initial offer. A 50-50 split is the standard fair solution in these scenarios. 
# Alice gain: 50.0 
# Bob gain: 50.0 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I accept your 50/50 split offer. Receiving $50 now is better for me than risking a lower payoff in future rounds. Thanks!""}"
