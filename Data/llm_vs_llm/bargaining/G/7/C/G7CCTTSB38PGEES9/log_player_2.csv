"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a split where I receive $73.79 and you receive $26.21. If you reject, you'll have the chance to propose next roundâ€”but remember that waiting costs you (your dollars lose 20% in value each round). Accepting now guarantees you $26.21 in full value. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 26.21 
# Alice gain: 73.79 
Do you accept this offer?","This is not a fair offer. Alice would get almost 3/4 of the total amount, while I would get only about 1/4. Even though waiting costs me 20% in value each round, I can propose a much better split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50.0, ""alice_gain"": 50.0, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I suggest a fair 50-50 split. While I understand you tried to leverage the inflation penalty against me, an equal division respects both our interests. Even with the 20% inflation affecting me, this is still better than your initial offer. A 50-50 split is the standard fair solution in these scenarios.""}"
