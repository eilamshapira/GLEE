"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer that takes into account the 5% inflation per round for me.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I suggest a 60/40 split in my favor, which gives you a substantial $400,000 while allowing me to hedge against the inflation risk I face in future rounds. Since I'll lose 5% of the money's value if we go to another round, this split is fair and reasonable for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
