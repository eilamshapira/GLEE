"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $400,000 while she takes $600,000 of the $1 million total.

The instructions mention that inflation doesn't affect me (0% inflation for me), so waiting for another round won't decrease the value of my potential share. However, I don't know how inflation affects Alice.

Since I can make a counter-offer in the next round, and there's no downside for me in terms of inflation, I'll reject this offer and propose a more favorable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more balanced division of the money.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose we split the money equally, with each of us receiving $500,000. This is a fair division that benefits us both equally."
