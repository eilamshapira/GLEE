"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40 in my favor to account for the inflation risk I'm facing. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 60-40 split in her favor, which would give me $400,000 and her $600,000.

If I reject this offer, I'll make a counter-offer in the next round, but the total amount will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation. That means I'd be dividing $800,000 in value (from my perspective).

If I want to get more than $400,000 in the next round, I would need more than 50% of the reduced amount, which might be difficult to get Alice to accept.

Given the inflation risk and the fairly reasonable initial offer, I'll accept.
