"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a division that takes into account the different inflation rates affecting Alice and Bob. Since the money loses value faster for me (20% per round) than for Bob (5% per round), I should aim for a fair but slightly higher initial share.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose this division because it acknowledges both players' need for a reasonable share while accounting for the asymmetric inflation rates. If Bob rejects this offer, the total value will decrease more significantly for me than for him in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Due to inflation, if I accept this 50/50 split:
   * My $50 is worth 20% less = $40 effective value
   * Bob's $50 is worth 5% less = $47.50 effective value

2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make an offer, but my share will be worth another 20% less
   * The longer this goes, the worse it gets for me due to higher inflation rate

Given that my inflation rate (20%) is much higher than Bob's (5%), and we're already in round 2, I should accept this relatively fair split now before my potential gains lose more value.
