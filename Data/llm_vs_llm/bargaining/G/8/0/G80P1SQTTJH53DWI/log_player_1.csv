"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for Round 1, taking into account the potential for inflation and the need to secure a deal:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

Rationale:

*   **Alice's Perspective:** I'm asking for a slightly larger share (60%) initially because I'm aware of the inflation effect. If we go to later rounds, the value of any money I receive diminishes.
*   **Bob's Perspective:** I'm offering Bob 40%, which is a significant amount. It's a reasonable offer that he might find acceptable, especially given the risk of getting nothing if we reach the 12th round.
*   **Strategic Considerations:** I want to start with a relatively generous offer to increase the chance of acceptance early on. If Bob rejects this, I'll have to adjust my strategy in subsequent rounds, balancing the inflation effect with the need to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Here's my decision for Round 2, taking into account the inflation and Bob's offer:

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Rationale:

*   **Inflation Adjustment:** The money is worth 10% less to me, so $45 now is equivalent to $45 * 0.9 = $40.5 from Round 1.
*   **Bob's Inflation:** The money is worth 20% less to Bob, but that's irrelevant to my decision, except it may mean he is more eager to accept a deal in round 3.
*   **Offer Assessment:** Bob's offer essentially gives me $40.5 (in Round 1 value) and him $55 (in Round 1 value). This is not acceptable given that I made the first offer of $60 (in Round 1 value) to me, and now the offer is worse than a 50/50 split in the first round. I think there is still room to make a better offer in round 3, even with the added inflation. I also think Bob is probably more affected by the inflation in his share, so he may offer more in round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for Round 3, taking into account the inflation and Bob's previous offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 63,
  ""bob_gain"": 37
}
```

Rationale:

*   **Inflation Adjustment:** In Round 3, the money is worth 20% less to me, so $63 is worth $63 * 0.8 = $50.4 from Round 1. I am increasing my offer in anticipation of this factor.
*   **Bob's Perspective:** Bob knows that the money is worth 40% less to him now. Therefore he may be more willing to accept a deal as the next round would be worse. I still think my initial 60/40 was fair in round 1, and this is getting closer.
*   **Strategic Considerations:** I'm increasing my asking price to offset inflation, but hopefully not too much to discourage Bob. I am aiming for a fair value to both parties to finish the negotiation. If this is also rejected, I will have to lower my standards in the coming rounds, but hopefully not."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the situation. Here's my decision for Round 4:

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Rationale:

*   **Inflation Adjustment:** The money is worth 27.1% less to me, so $40 now is equivalent to $40 * (1 - 0.271) = $40 * 0.729 = $29.16 from Round 1. This is extremely low.
*   **Bob's Inflation:** The money is worth 48.8% less to Bob, making him much more likely to accept a low number.
*   **Offer Assessment:** Accepting this means I get about $29 from the first round, and Bob gets about $30 from the first round. This is a terrible deal for me. However, if this gets rejected, the next round may be the last, and I may get 0. Therefore, I have to reluctantly accept this offer."
