Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 37 
# Alice gain: 63 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer is worse than her initial offer, it's still early in the game. I need to signal that I'm serious about getting a larger share and that I'm willing to risk letting the money devalue to some extent."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

I'm increasing my demand slightly to signal firmness, but also offering a round number to make it seem more appealing.  The devaluation is becoming a factor, but I'm hoping Alice will be more willing to settle to avoid further losses."
