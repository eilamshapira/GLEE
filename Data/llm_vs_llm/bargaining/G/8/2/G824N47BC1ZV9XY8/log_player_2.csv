"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40, a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice is offering a 60/40 split in her favor, which means I would get $400,000. Given that inflation will reduce the value by 20% each round, if I reject this offer, the total amount to be divided next round would effectively be worth $800,000 to me. 

If I make a counter-offer in the next round, I'd need to consider that inflation effect. Let me think about whether this initial offer is reasonable or if I should try for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a fair counter-offer that considers the inflation factor.

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, since we both face value loss with each round, I suggest a 55/45 split in my favor. This is actually fair considering you offered 60/40 in your favor initially. Let's conclude this efficiently before inflation diminishes our total value further.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, let's meet in the middle. This offer is more favorable to you than my initial one, and it's better for both of us to agree sooner rather than later. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice has improved her offer to me from $400,000 to $480,000, while reducing her portion from $600,000 to $520,000. However, I also now understand that inflation affects us differently - my money is worth 36% less than in round 1, while Alice's money doesn't lose value with time.

With 36% inflation for me, the $480,000 is effectively worth only $307,200 of original value to me. If I reject and we go to round 4, my money will be worth even less due to inflation.

Given this asymmetric inflation and the improved offer, it makes sense to accept now rather than continue negotiating with my declining purchasing power.
