"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share for both 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $40 while she gets $60. While she calls it a ""fair share,"" it's actually favoring her by a significant margin. Since there's no inflation affecting my portion in future rounds, I can safely reject this and make a counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split, slightly in my favor since I'm now making the offer.

{
""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I propose a more balanced split that's fair for both of us""
}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 42.5 
# Alice gain: 57.5 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:
1. Alice's offer is $42.5 for me and $57.5 for her
2. Due to inflation, her $57.5 is actually worth 19% less to her (equivalent to about $46.57)
3. My $42.5 maintains its full value since inflation doesn't affect my gains
4. While this offer is better than her first one, I could still reject and make a counter-offer
5. However, further rounds might lead to more inflation affecting Alice's portion, which could make her less likely to accept a reasonable offer

Given that the real value difference between our portions isn't that large anymore due to inflation, and to avoid the risk of a prolonged negotiation:
