"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice offers me $40 out of $100
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 10% inflation, the money will be worth less to me next round
4. After inflation, $40 now is better than $44.44 next round ($40 / 0.9)
5. The offer isn't great, but considering inflation and the risk of multiple rounds, it's reasonable
