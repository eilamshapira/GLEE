"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, as I'm taking the risk of proposing first. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""My turn now, let's make it a bit more even, considering the risk and the decreasing value of money in each round.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. It's getting riskier with each round, so I'm offering an even split. Accept and we both walk away with something. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the decreasing value of money, an even split might be reasonable. However, since the money is worth 19% less for me and 36% less for Alice, I should take into account that Alice is taking a bigger hit due to inflation.
