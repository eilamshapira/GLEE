"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given the inflation rate of 20% per round for me (Alice), I need to consider this carefully. The longer we negotiate, the less value I'll receive.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is fair considering I'm facing a 20% inflation penalty per round while you aren't affected by inflation at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given the inflation rate affecting me, I need to reconsider my approach. After two rounds, the money is now worth 36% less to me than originally, so I should be more willing to compromise.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm adjusting my proposal to a 55-45 split. This is a fair middle ground considering the time pressure affects me more significantly than you due to the asymmetric inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I see that we're now at round 5, and the inflation has severely reduced the value of my potential gains. After 4 rounds, the money is worth about 59% less to me than originally. Given this significant disadvantage and Bob's increasingly aggressive offers, I need to compromise further.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose an even 50-50 split. This is completely fair and equitable, and considering the inflation penalty is only affecting me, continuing to negotiate would mainly benefit Bob while hurting my position."
