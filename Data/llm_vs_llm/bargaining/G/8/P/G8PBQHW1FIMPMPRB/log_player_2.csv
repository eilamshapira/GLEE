"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me $400,000 while taking $600,000 for herself. Since this is the first round and Alice's money loses 20% value each round, I have leverage. If I reject, in the next round:
- I can make a counter-offer
- The $1M will be worth 20% less to Alice (but same for me)
- Alice will be more likely to accept a better deal for me

I can likely get a better split by rejecting this and making a counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll make a counter-offer that takes into account that:
1. The money is now worth 20% less to Alice compared to round 1
2. I know Alice wants to avoid further devaluation of her share
3. I can offer a more favorable split for myself while still being reasonable

I'll propose a 60/40 split in my favor:

{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000}

The rationale I can provide to Alice is that since the money is worth 20% less to her now, she should accept this offer rather than risk further devaluation in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice has improved her offer from $400K to $450K for me
2. For Alice, the $550K she's asking for is actually worth only $352K (64% of $550K) due to the 36% inflation on her side
3. If I reject, we go to round 4 where:
   - I can make another offer
   - Alice's money will be worth 48% less than round 1
   - My money maintains its value
4. We still have plenty of rounds left (9 more)
5. The inflation pressure on Alice's side gives me increasing leverage

Since Alice is already showing willingness to negotiate (improved offer) and the inflation is significantly impacting her share's value, I believe I can get a better deal by rejecting this offer and making a counter-proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that:
1. Alice's money is now worth 48% less than round 1 (she only gets 52% of the nominal value)
2. Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by improving her previous offer
3. She'll want to avoid further devaluation of her share
4. I maintain full value of my share

I'll propose a more aggressive split in my favor, but not so extreme that she'll definitely reject:

{""bob_gain"": 700000, 
""alice_gain"": 300000}

This offer gives Alice $300,000 (worth $156,000 to her after 48% devaluation), but if she rejects, her next round's money will be worth even less. This should create pressure to accept while giving me a significantly better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze this situation:

1. Alice is now offering a 50/50 split ($500K each)
2. For Alice, her $500K is only worth $204.8K (40.96% of $500K) due to the 59.04% inflation
3. If I reject:
   - Next round I can make another offer
   - Alice's money will be worth ~67% less than round 1
   - My money maintains its value
4. We still have 7 rounds left
5. Alice keeps improving her offers ($400K → $450K → $500K for me)

However, at this point:
- The inflation is severely impacting Alice's share
- She's showing significant willingness to compromise
- Further negotiations might lead to diminishing returns
- The 50/50 split is quite fair from my perspective, especially since I get full value

I think this is a reasonable point to accept. While I might get a bit more by continuing, the risk/reward ratio suggests taking this deal is smart.
