"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair on the surface. However, I need to account for the inflation effect.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value will be worth 5% less to me. That means the full $10,000 would be worth $9,500 to me in the next round. Even if I were to get more than $5,000 in my counter-offer, I need to ensure it exceeds $5,000 in current value.

Given that a perfectly equal split is generally considered fair, and the inflation penalty makes waiting costly for me, I'll accept this offer.
