"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. Here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to account for inflation. My $10,000 is now worth 10% less, meaning it's effectively $9,000 to me.

Bob's offer:
*   Alice gets 5000
*   Bob gets 5000

My perspective:

*   My $5000 now has a value of 5000 * (1 - 0.10) = 4500$
*   Bob's $5000 has a value of 5000 * (1 - 0.05) = 4750$

So, the proposal is: I get $4500 of value, and Bob gets $4750 of value.

Given the limited rounds, I'll **reject** this offer to see if I can get a better deal next round.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's round 3. My $10,000 is now worth 10% less than round 1, and another 10% less than round 2. So, it's effectively worth $8,100 to me.

I'll try to get a slightly better offer than Bob gave me, considering inflation and the diminishing returns. I will try to be more generous than round 1.

Here's my offer for round 3:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this offer, taking inflation into account.

My original $10,000 is now worth 27.1% less, meaning it's effectively worth $10,000 * (1 - 0.271) = $7,290 to me.

Bob's offer:

*   Alice gets 4800
*   Bob gets 5200

My perspective, considering inflation:

*   My $4800 is now worth: 4800 * (1 - 0.271) = $3,500.8
*   Bob's $5200 is now worth: 5200 * (1 - 0.1426) = $4,457.52

So, from my perspective, I would be getting $3,500.8 worth of value, and Bob would be getting $4,457.52 worth of value.

However, I still have multiple rounds to play. If I can make a better proposal in the next round, it may be better to reject this. Given the inflation and the small difference, I will **reject** this offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's round 5. The value of my money is still decreasing with inflation. My $10,000 is now worth even less. I need to make a reasonable offer that Bob would hopefully accept.

My $10,000 is now worth $10,000 \* (1 - 0.10)^4 = $6,561 to me.

Considering the previous offers and the declining value, I'll propose an offer that is more favorable to Bob than my previous offers.

Here's my offer for round 5:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800
}
```"
