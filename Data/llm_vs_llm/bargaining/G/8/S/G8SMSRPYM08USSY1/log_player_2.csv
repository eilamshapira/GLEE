"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $4,000 out of the $10,000, which is 40% of the total. If I reject and we go to the next round, I'll make a counter-offer, but the money will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation.

Given that we have 12 rounds maximum and each round decreases the value by 5% for me, I should consider whether I can reasonably expect to get a better deal by countering.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more favorable to me while still being reasonable enough that Alice might accept it.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split of the money. This is an equitable division that benefits us both equally. Since we both face the risk of losing value with each round of negotiation, a balanced split makes the most sense and allows us to conclude the negotiation efficiently."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to analyze this offer carefully. Alice is now offering me $4,500, which is better than her initial offer of $4,000. However, due to inflation, this $4,500 is worth 9.75% less to me than money in round 1, making its effective value about $4,061.25.

Alice has revealed that her inflation rate (19%) is significantly higher than mine (9.75%). This gives me some negotiating leverage, as delays are more costly for her.

Given that Alice improved her offer and the inflation affects her more severely, this seems like a reasonable improvement. However, I believe we can still reach a better agreement, and I have the advantage of knowing her inflation rate is higher.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Now that I know Alice has a higher inflation rate (19% by round 3 compared to my 9.75%), I'll make an offer that considers our different time pressures while being more favorable to me than her previous offer.

{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800}

I'm proposing that I receive $5,200 and Alice receives $4,800. This is a reasonable improvement from my perspective compared to Alice's last offer, while acknowledging that delays are more costly for Alice due to her higher inflation rate. Since we both lose value with each passing round, and Alice loses value faster, this proposal provides a fair path to conclusion that benefits both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate this situation:

1. Alice has offered me $4,800, which is $300 more than her previous offer of $4,500
2. Due to inflation, my money is now worth 18.55% less than in round 1, making this $4,800 effectively worth about $3,909.60
3. Alice's inflation rate (34.39%) continues to be significantly higher than mine (18.55%)
4. We're now in round 5 of a possible 12 rounds
5. Alice has moved from her original 60/40 split to a 52/48 split

Given that:
- Alice has made a significant concession
- Her inflation rate is nearly twice mine, making delays much more costly for her
- The effective value I'd receive is still reasonable
- We're approaching the middle of our negotiation window
