Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split where I get 55% and you get 45%. This way we both walk away with a substantial amount without risking inflation losses in future rounds.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split in my favor is fair, considering the potential for inflation.  Let's get this done before things get worse! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The potential loss from inflation (10%) is less damaging than accepting such an unfavorable split. I can make a counter-offer in the next round that might be more beneficial for both of us."
