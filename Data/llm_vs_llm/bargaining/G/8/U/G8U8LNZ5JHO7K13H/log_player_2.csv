"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this... 

Alice is offering me $550,000 (55%) and keeping $450,000 (45%) for herself. This is actually quite a fair split, slightly in my favor.

If I reject, I'll get to make a counter-offer next round, but:
1. The money will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation
2. Alice could reject my counter-offer, leading to further rounds and more value loss
3. The current offer is already favorable to me

With inflation, if I reject, the $550,000 would effectively become worth $522,500 next round. Since I already have a good offer that gives me the majority share, it's better to accept now rather than risk losing value through inflation.
