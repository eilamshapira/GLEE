"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split since it's the first round, which often helps establish goodwill and increases chances of acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose a 50-50 split, which is fair and equitable for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Due to inflation affecting Bob, his $60 is actually worth $48 (60 * 0.8) to him
2. My $40 maintains its full value
3. We still have 10 rounds left, but each round Bob's value decreases
4. I could counter-offer in the next round, but Bob might reject again
5. This is actually a reasonable offer given that Bob is affected by inflation
