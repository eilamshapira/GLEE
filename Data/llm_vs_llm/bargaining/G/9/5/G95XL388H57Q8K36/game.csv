400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, time is money—literally. Given the risk of inflation reducing our funds' worth, I propose a swift agreement. This offer gives me a modest advantage for taking initiative, while ensuring you receive a fair share. Let's secure our funds now before any further devaluation.",Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"I understand your desire for a larger share for taking initiative, but I'm also experiencing inflation. Let's meet in the middle. 55/45 seems more equitable considering the circumstances. Let's finalize this!",Alice,3,

550000.0,450000.0,"Alice, we’ve both seen how delay hurts—your money loses nearly 10% value each round while mine holds steady. I know in round 3 you suggested a 55/45 split, which leaves you with an effective value of about $496375. If we delay further, your share will only shrink in worth. I propose we finalize now: I receive $450000 and you $550000 nominally. This locks in your effective value before any additional devaluation, and it’s as good as it gets under these conditions. Let’s seal the deal now and avoid further losses.",Bob,4,
