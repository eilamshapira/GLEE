Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, time is money—literally. Given the risk of inflation reducing our funds' worth, I propose a swift agreement. This offer gives me a modest advantage for taking initiative, while ensuring you receive a fair share. Let's secure our funds now before any further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we’ve both seen how delay hurts—your money loses nearly 10% value each round while mine holds steady. I know in round 3 you suggested a 55/45 split, which leaves you with an effective value of about $496375. If we delay further, your share will only shrink in worth. I propose we finalize now: I receive $450000 and you $550000 nominally. This locks in your effective value before any additional devaluation, and it’s as good as it gets under these conditions. Let’s seal the deal now and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
