"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Alice, time is money—literally. Given the risk of inflation reducing our funds' worth, I propose a swift agreement. This offer gives me a modest advantage for taking initiative, while ensuring you receive a fair share. Let's secure our funds now before any further devaluation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire for a larger share for taking initiative, but I'm also experiencing inflation. Let's meet in the middle. 55/45 seems more equitable considering the circumstances. Let's finalize this! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Alice, we’ve both seen how delay hurts—your money loses nearly 10% value each round while mine holds steady. I know in round 3 you suggested a 55/45 split, which leaves you with an effective value of about $496,375. If we delay further, your share will only shrink in worth. I propose we finalize now: I receive $450,000 and you $550,000 nominally. This locks in your effective value before any additional devaluation, and it’s as good as it gets under these conditions. Let’s seal the deal now and avoid further losses.""}"
