"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically:

1. It's a 50-50 split, which is generally considered fair
2. However, I'm in round 1, and if I reject, I can make a counter-offer
3. If I reject, the money will be worth 20% less to me in the next round
4. Current value for me: $5000
5. Next round max potential value: $8000 (if I propose 8000/2000), but it would be worth 20% less, so effectively $6400

Given that:
- A 50-50 split is quite fair
- Rejecting would expose me to inflation risk
- Alice might reject an aggressive counter-offer
- This is early in the game where the money has full value
