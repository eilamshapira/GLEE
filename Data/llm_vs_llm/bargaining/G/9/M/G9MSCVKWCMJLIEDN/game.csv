4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, since inflation affects you more (20% vs my 5%), we should reach an agreement quickly. This offer gives you $4500 now, which is worth more than what you'd get after another round of inflation. It's fair considering our different inflation rates.",Bob,2,

4700.0,5300.0,"Alice, let's finalize this deal. With the current inflation, you've already lost 36% of value and will lose nearly 49% if we go another round. This offer of $4700 to you is actually worth more now than a higher nominal amount in future rounds. This is our best chance for mutual benefit given the asymmetric inflation.",Bob,4,
