"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $4,000 and she gets $6,000 of the $10,000. 

If I reject this offer, I'll make a counter-offer in the next round, but the total value will decrease by 5% for me and 20% for Alice. That means the $10,000 would be worth $9,500 to me and only $8,000 to Alice in the next round.

Given this significant inflation penalty, especially for Alice, and considering that I'll get to make the next offer if I reject, I think I can get a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a strategic offer that accounts for the inflation pressures on both of us, especially the larger 20% penalty Alice faces.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, since inflation affects you more (20% vs my 5%), we should reach an agreement quickly. This offer gives you $4,500 now, which is worth more than what you'd get after another round of inflation. It's fair considering our different inflation rates.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to analyze this new offer carefully. Alice is now offering me $4,200 and keeping $5,800 for herself.

Since we're now in round 3, the inflation impacts are:
- For me: 9.75% reduction in value
- For Alice: 36% reduction in value

If I reject this offer, we'll move to round 4, where:
- My inflation penalty will increase further (to about 14.26%)
- Alice's penalty will increase to about 48.8%

Given these severe inflation penalties, especially for Alice, and the fact that she has moved a bit from her initial offer, I should consider whether this is reasonable or if I can get a better deal in the next round.

Since Alice is facing much steeper inflation, she has more incentive to settle. However, she's only offered me a small improvement from her initial proposal. I believe I can negotiate for a better split.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5300, 
""alice_gain"": 4700,
""message"": ""Alice, let's finalize this deal. With the current inflation, you've already lost 36% of value and will lose nearly 49% if we go another round. This offer of $4,700 to you is actually worth more now than a higher nominal amount in future rounds. This is our best chance for mutual benefit given the asymmetric inflation.""}"
