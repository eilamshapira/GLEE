Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Before making an offer, I'd like to understand how inflation is affecting the value of the money for Alice. Since I don't have that information, I'll assume that Alice is also experiencing inflation similarly to me. Given that the money is worth 14.1375% less for me now, I should target a higher amount to compensate for this loss.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because even though the money is worth 18.55% less than in the first round, accepting this offer will at least secure me some money."
