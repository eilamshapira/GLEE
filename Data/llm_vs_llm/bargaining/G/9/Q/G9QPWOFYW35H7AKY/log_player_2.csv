"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $400,000 for me
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
   * The money will be worth 20% less to me
   * My maximum potential gain would be reduced due to inflation
   * Even if I proposed taking most of the money, Alice might reject
   * Another round means more value lost to inflation

While $400,000 is less than half, it's still a substantial amount. Given the inflation penalty and uncertainty about future rounds, accepting a good offer now might be better than risking a worse outcome later.
