"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split is fair and benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me $400,000 while taking $600,000 for herself. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the total value will be reduced by 10% due to inflation (so the total pot would be worth $900,000 to me).

Even with inflation, I could potentially get more by making a counter-offer. However, Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to further rounds and more value lost to inflation.

Given that $400,000 is still a substantial amount and the risk of losing more value to inflation in subsequent rounds, I'll accept this offer.
