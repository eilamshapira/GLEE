"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 55/45 split which is fairly balanced. If we keep rejecting offers, we'll both lose money to inflation. This is nearly even and allows us both to walk away with substantial amounts immediately. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
