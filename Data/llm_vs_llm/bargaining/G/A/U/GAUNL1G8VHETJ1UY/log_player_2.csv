"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

If I reject, in the next round (Round 2):
- The $1M will be worth 20% less to me
- The $1M will be worth 5% less to Alice
- I can make the proposal

With the current offer:
- I get $500,000 now
- Alice gets $500,000

If I reject and propose in Round 2:
- My $500,000 would only be worth $400,000 (20% less)
- Alice's portion would be worth 5% less

Given this significant depreciation for me (20%) versus Alice's smaller depreciation (5%), I should accept this fair 50-50 split now rather than risk getting less value in subsequent rounds.
