"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer that takes into account the inflation penalties we both face, but recognizes that I (Alice) face a steeper inflation penalty (10% vs Bob's 5%).

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest this division because we both face diminishing returns if we continue to later rounds. Since my penalty is higher, I should reasonably get a bit more in the first round, but I want to make it fair enough that you'll accept rather than counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a more balanced offer that accounts for the increasing inflation penalties we both face. At this point, my money is worth 20% less than in round 1, and Bob's is worth 10% less.

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}

Since we're now in round 3, continuing further will significantly reduce the value for both of us, but especially for me due to my higher inflation rate. This offer gives Bob a better deal than my initial proposal while still acknowledging my disadvantage in the inflation structure."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","I notice that we're now in round 5, and the inflation has significantly reduced the value of money for both of us. For me, the money is now worth 34.39% less than in round 1, and for Bob, it's worth 18.55% less.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm offering an equal split of $50 each. This is a fair compromise that recognizes we're both losing value with each passing round. Given that I face a higher inflation rate (10% per round vs. your 5%), continuing this negotiation is especially costly for me. This 50-50 split represents a reasonable middle ground that allows us both to walk away with a fair portion before inflation erodes our gains further."
