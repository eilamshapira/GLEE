6000.0,4000.0,I propose we divide the amount such that I receive $6000 and you receive $4000. I think this is a fair starting point considering the potential decreases in value if we enter additional rounds. What do you think?,Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"Considering the decreasing value of the money, I think this offer is more reasonable. If we proceed to the next round, the value will decrease further, so it's in our best interest to reach an agreement sooner rather than later.",Bob,2,
