"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I propose we divide the amount such that I receive $6000 and you receive $4000. I think this is a fair starting point considering the potential decreases in value if we enter additional rounds. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the decreasing value of the money, I think this offer is more reasonable. If we proceed to the next round, the value will decrease further, so it's in our best interest to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
