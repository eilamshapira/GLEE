"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we divide the amount such that I receive $6000 and you receive $4000. I think this is a fair starting point considering the potential decreases in value if we enter additional rounds. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Alice in each round, I'll take that into consideration for my offer.

The original amount was $10,000. After one round, the value for me is $10,000 * 0.9 = $9,000, and for Alice, it's $10,000 * 0.8 = $8,000.

I'll make an offer that is more favorable to me, considering the decreasing value.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Considering the decreasing value of the money, I think this offer is more reasonable. If we proceed to the next round, the value will decrease further, so it's in our best interest to reach an agreement sooner rather than later.""}"
