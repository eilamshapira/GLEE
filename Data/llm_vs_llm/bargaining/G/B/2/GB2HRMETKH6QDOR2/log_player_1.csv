"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob that takes into account our different inflation rates. Since Bob has a higher inflation rate (20% vs my 10%), it makes sense for him to prefer finishing the game sooner rather than later.

""message"": ""Hi Bob! Let's make this simple. I'm offering you $45 while I take $55. If we go to another round, we both lose money due to inflation - you especially, since your inflation rate is higher (20% vs my 10%). This is a fair first offer that saves us both from losing value.""}"
