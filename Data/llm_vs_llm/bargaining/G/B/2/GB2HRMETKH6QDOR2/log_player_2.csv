"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Let's make this simple. I'm offering you $45 while I take $55. If we go to another round, we both lose money due to inflation - you especially, since your inflation rate is higher (20% vs my 10%). This is a fair first offer that saves us both from losing value. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate whether this offer is fair, considering the inflation rates.

If I reject and we go to another round:
- The $100 will be worth $80 to me (20% less)
- The $100 will be worth $90 to Alice (10% less)

Alice's current offer gives me $45, which is less than half but not by much. If I make a counter-offer next round, I'd be dividing $80 (my perceived value), and Alice would need to find it better than the $55 she's offering now.

Since my inflation rate is higher, delaying isn't in my favor. While I could counter-offer, the decrease in value would likely lead to a worse outcome for me.
