"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's make it more balanced, 55/45 in my favor. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $450,000, but it's worth 10% less than the original value. So, the actual value I'll get is $450,000 * 0.9 = $405,000.

Since this is the first offer I've received, I'll consider it. However, I think I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each round, and 5% less for Bob, I'll try to make a more appealing offer to Bob while still being mindful of my own loss due to inflation.

In Round 1, the value was $1,000,000.
In Round 2, the value for me was $1,000,000 * 0.9 = $900,000, and for Bob, it was $1,000,000 * 0.95 = $950,000.
In Round 3, the value for me is $900,000 * 0.9 = $810,000, and for Bob, it's $950,000 * 0.95 = $902,500.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, 
""bob_gain"": 580000, 
""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground, 58/42 in your favor.""}"
