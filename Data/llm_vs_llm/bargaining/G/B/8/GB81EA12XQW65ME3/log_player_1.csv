"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my first offer to divide the $10,000. Since I need to consider that with each round, the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I should aim for a fair deal that we can agree upon quickly.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose a 50-50 split of the money. This is a fair division that gives us both equal shares. Given the inflation rates, we both benefit from reaching an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new offer considering the continued inflation effects. Since we're now in round 3, the money is worth even less for both of us (40% less for me, 20% less for Bob compared to round 1).

{""alice_gain"": 4800, ""bob_gain"": 5200}

I propose this split as a reasonable compromise. Bob's previous offer gave him a larger share, but given the inflation rates affecting us both, it makes sense to reach an agreement quickly. This offer is more balanced while acknowledging that Bob might expect a bit more than an even split."
