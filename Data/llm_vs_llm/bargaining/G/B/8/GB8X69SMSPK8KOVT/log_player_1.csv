"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to make an offer to Bob, keeping in mind the inflation that affects me.

Here's my first offer:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

My reasoning: I'm starting with a relatively favorable offer for myself, acknowledging the potential for inflation to erode my gains in later rounds. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer and we can avoid further rounds where the money loses value for me."
