"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer is a 50-50 split ($500,000 each)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, in the next round my share would need to be at least $525,000 to be equivalent to $500,000 now
4. There's no guarantee Alice would accept a more favorable offer from me
5. A fair 50-50 split is generally considered reasonable in negotiation games

Given that inflation will reduce the real value of any future offer for me, and that this is a fair split, I should accept now rather than risk getting less value in future rounds.
