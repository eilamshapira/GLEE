"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split, considering that any delay will cost me 20% due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose a 50-50 split, which gives each of us $5,000. This is a fair and equitable division that should be acceptable to both parties. If Bob rejects this offer, the next round's $10,000 will only be worth $8,000 to me due to inflation, so it's in both our interests to agree now."
