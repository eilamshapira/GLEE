"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This offer accounts for the slight inflation disadvantage we both face. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, I need to consider the actual value of the offer.

The original amount I would get is $5500, but due to 10% inflation, its value is reduced to $5500 * 0.9 = $4950.

Considering this, I think I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less now, I'll try to get a better deal.

For me, the original $10,000 is now worth $10,000 * 0.9 * 0.9 = $8100 (10% less in Round 1 and another 10% less in Round 2).
For Bob, the original $10,000 is now worth $10,000 * 0.95 * 0.95 = $9025 (5% less in Round 1 and another 5% less in Round 2).

Considering this, I'll make an offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

{""alice_gain"": 6500, 
""bob_gain"": 3500, 
""message"": ""Time is money, let's settle before it's worth less""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a very reasonable offer considering the inflation. Let's be practical. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 27.1% less, I need to consider the actual value of the offer.

The original amount I would get is $5200, but due to 27.1% inflation, its value is reduced to $5200 * (1 - 0.271) = $5200 * 0.729 = $3790.

Considering this, I think this offer might be reasonable, given the significant decrease in value due to inflation.
