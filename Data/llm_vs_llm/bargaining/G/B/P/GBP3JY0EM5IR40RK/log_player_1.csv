"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, the actual value I get from Bob's offer is 400000 * 0.9 = 360000.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is not favorable to me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less in each round, in round 3, it's worth 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 of the original value.

I'll make a more favorable offer to myself:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 27.1% less, the actual value I get from Bob's offer is 420000 * (1 - 0.271) = 420000 * 0.729 = 306180.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is still not very favorable to me, but the inflation is also affecting the value of the money, so I should consider the alternative of making another offer, which would further decrease the value of the money I could get.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less in each round, in round 5, it's worth 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.6561 of the original value.

I'll make a more favorable offer to myself, but also considering that Bob's offers haven't been very generous so far, I'll try to find a balance:

{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000}"
