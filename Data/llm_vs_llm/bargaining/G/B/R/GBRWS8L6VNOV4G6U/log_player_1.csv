"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I want to make a fair offer to Bob that gives both of us a good outcome while accounting for the impact of inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm offering a 50-50 split as a fair starting point. We both get $5,000, which seems equitable. Since inflation will reduce the value by 10% each round, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly rather than prolonging negotiations."
