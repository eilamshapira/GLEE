"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a fair split considering our different inflation rates. You get 450k, I get 550k. If we delay, we both lose value - you more than me. Let's make a deal now. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's offer, considering our different inflation rates.

Alice offers me $450,000 and she takes $550,000. This is a 45%-55% split.

If I reject, we move to the next round where I make an offer, but my money loses 20% value while hers only loses 10%. 

This means my bargaining position weakens faster than hers with each round, so there's a strategic advantage to accepting a reasonable early offer.

$450,000 now is better than potentially getting less value in later rounds due to my higher inflation rate.
