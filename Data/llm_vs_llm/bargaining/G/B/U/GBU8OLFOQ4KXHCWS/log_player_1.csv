"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I see Bob's offer.

Due to inflation, the $1,000,000 is now worth less to me. My share will be worth only 95% of its face value.

Considering that, here's my decision:

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 3. Remember, the money is worth less to me now. I need to make a more compelling offer to Bob.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I see Bob's offer in Round 4. Inflation is eating away at my potential gains.

*   **Original value:** $1,000,000
*   **Inflation loss:** 14.26%

This means that $1,000,000 now feels like getting $857,400 to me.

Here's my decision:

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
