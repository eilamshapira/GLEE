"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
* Alice is offering me $400,000 (40%)
* She wants to keep $600,000 (60%)

While this isn't an even split, $400,000 is still a significant amount. However, by rejecting, I can make my own proposal next round. Given that it's early in the game and I could potentially negotiate a better deal, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer, but still slightly in my favor since I have the proposal power now:

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because:
1. It's closer to an even division than Alice's first offer
2. While I get a slight advantage, it's not so unfair that Alice would definitely reject it
3. If Alice rejects, she'll get to make the next offer, but she'll know I'm willing to negotiate reasonably"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 425000 
# Alice gain: 575000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze the situation:
1. Alice's first offer was 400k/600k
2. I countered with 550k/450k
3. Now she's offering 425k/575k - a slight improvement from her first offer

Alice has moved slightly in my direction (increased my share by $25k from her first offer), but still wants a significant advantage. Since the game could continue and offers might improve, I'll reject this offer too. However, I note that she's showing some willingness to negotiate.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll adjust my offer to be more moderate than my previous one, showing willingness to compromise while still seeking a relatively fair split:

{""bob_gain"": 510000, ""alice_gain"": 490000}

This offer is more balanced than my previous one because:
1. It's very close to a 50/50 split, which is objectively fair
2. I've reduced my demand significantly from my last offer (from 550k to 510k)
3. It's a reasonable middle ground between our previous offers
4. The slight advantage to me (510k vs 490k) is much smaller than what Alice was asking for, making it harder to justify rejecting"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 437500 
# Alice gain: 562500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze the progression:
1. Alice: 400k/600k
2. Me: 550k/450k
3. Alice: 425k/575k
4. Me: 510k/490k
5. Now Alice: 437.5k/562.5k

Alice keeps improving her offers:
- First offer: 400k for me
- Second offer: 425k for me
- Current offer: 437.5k for me

While I'd prefer a more even split, the pattern suggests we might be reaching a limit of how much Alice will concede. Each round of rejection carries the risk of worse offers. Given that Alice has shown consistent movement in my direction and we're now at a somewhat reasonable split, I'll accept this offer.
