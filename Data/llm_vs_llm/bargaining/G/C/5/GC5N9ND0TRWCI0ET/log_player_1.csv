"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a favorable but reasonable split, considering I'm affected by 20% inflation per round while Bob isn't.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. This is a fair 60-40 split that gives me a slight advantage while still being reasonable enough for Bob to accept. If he rejects, my next opportunity will be worth 20% less to me, so I'm motivated to make a decent offer now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3750 
# Bob gain: 6250 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
- If I accept, I get $3,750, but due to 20% inflation, it's only worth $3,000 to me
- If I reject, we go to round 3, where any money I get will be worth another 20% less (so only 64% of original value)
- In round 3, I could propose again, but Bob knows I'm under pressure from inflation

The offer isn't great, but with mounting inflation pressure, waiting could make things worse for me. Bob is making a strategic offer knowing my money loses value each round.
