""message"": ""Hi Bob! Since I face 10% inflation per round, it's important we reach an agreement soon. I'm offering a fair split that slightly favors me since waiting costs me more. If you accept now, we both walk away with good value rather than risking further rounds where inflation reduces our total value.""}"
