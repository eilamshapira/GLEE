"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","For the first round, I'll make a reasonable offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob with each passing round, it's in both of our interests to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. Considering this, I'll propose a split that slightly favors me to account for the risk of waiting, but still offers Bob a significant amount to encourage acceptance.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the offer from Bob, let's calculate the actual value considering the inflation:

- Original amount for me: $480,000
- Original amount for Bob: $520,000

Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob due to inflation:

- My actual gain: $480,000 * 0.95 = $456,000
- Bob's actual gain: $520,000 * 0.9 = $468,000

Considering this is only the second round and there are 10 more rounds to go, accepting this offer might not be the best strategy, especially since the value of the money will continue to decrease. However, the difference in value isn't drastically in my favor if I were to reject and potentially negotiate a better split in subsequent rounds, considering the decreasing value of the money.

Given the circumstances, I think it's reasonable to reject this offer and try to negotiate a better split in the next round, hoping that the decreasing value of the money for both of us will encourage Bob to make a more favorable offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that Bob's offer in Round 2 was not accepted, and considering the inflation factor, I'll make a new offer for Round 3. Remember, the money's value decreases by 5% for me and 10% for Bob with each round.

Initially, the total value of the money was $1,000,000. After two rounds, the value for me would be $1,000,000 * (0.95)^2 and for Bob $1,000,000 * (0.9)^2.

Let's calculate these values:
- For me: $1,000,000 * 0.95 * 0.95 = $1,000,000 * 0.9025 = $902,500
- For Bob: $1,000,000 * 0.9 * 0.9 = $1,000,000 * 0.81 = $810,000

Considering these values, I'll aim for a split that reflects the decreasing value of the money but still tries to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Since Bob's valuation decreases more rapidly, I might aim for a slightly more favorable split than before, but still reasonable enough for Bob to consider accepting.

Given the decreasing value, a 50/50 split based on the original $1,000,000 would not account for the differential in value decrease. Thus, I'll propose a split that slightly favors me but is still attractive for Bob to accept, considering the rapid decrease in the value of his potential gain.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 540000 
# Bob gain: 460000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze Bob's offer in Round 4, considering the inflation.

Original amounts:
- My gain: $540,000
- Bob's gain: $460,000

Given the inflation rates:
- My gain is worth 5% less each round, so after 3 rounds, it's 0.95^3 = 0.857375 (or approximately 14.26% less) of the original value.
- Bob's gain is worth 10% less each round, so after 3 rounds, it's 0.9^3 = 0.729 (or approximately 27.1% less) of the original value.

Adjusted for inflation:
- My actual gain: $540,000 * 0.857375 ≈ $462,987
- Bob's actual gain: $460,000 * 0.729 ≈ $335,240

Considering these adjusted values, Bob's offer seems more favorable to me compared to the previous rounds, especially since the value of the money continues to decrease for both of us. Accepting this offer would give me a significant amount, and the difference in value decrease between us might not justify waiting for a potentially better offer in future rounds, given the risk of further devaluation.

Given the circumstances, I think it's reasonable to accept this offer, as it provides a substantial gain for me and acknowledges the differential impact of inflation on our potential earnings.
