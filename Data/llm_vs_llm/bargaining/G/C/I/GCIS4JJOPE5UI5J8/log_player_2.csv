"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me after the first round, the actual amount I'm dividing is $1,000,000 * 0.9 = $900,000. 

However, to make the offer, I'll still use the original $1,000,000 as the base and adjust my share accordingly.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Alice's offer, the $480,000 I gain is actually worth $480,000 * 0.81 (1 - 0.19) = $388,800.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 19% less for me and 9.75% less for Alice after 3 rounds, I'll make an offer considering these values.

For me, the actual amount is $1,000,000 * 0.81 = $810,000.
For Alice, the actual amount is $1,000,000 * 0.9025 = $902,500.

I'll aim for a split that's somewhat favorable to me, given the decreasing value.
