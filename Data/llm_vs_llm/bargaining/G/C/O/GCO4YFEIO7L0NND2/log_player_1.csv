"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair offer to Bob considering the inflation effect for me.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose this division because it's slightly in my favor but still quite fair for Bob. Since the money will be worth 5% less for me in the next round, I'd prefer to reach an agreement now rather than risk further devaluation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that we're entering round 3 and the money is now worth 10% less for me than it was in round 1, I'll adjust my offer to be more appealing to Bob while still accounting for my inflation disadvantage.

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}

I'm proposing a more balanced split that acknowledges Bob's stronger position due to the inflation only affecting me. This offer gives Bob a better deal than my initial proposal while still compensating me somewhat for the inflation effect."
