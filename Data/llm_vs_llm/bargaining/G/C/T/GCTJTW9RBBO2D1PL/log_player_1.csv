"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's make this fair and quick - I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. With inflation affecting me more than you, this is a reasonable offer that benefits us both.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I believe a more equitable split is in order, considering I'm not as impacted by inflation as you are. This offer gives me a slightly larger share, but it's still a good deal for you compared to future rounds. Let's end this now. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

If I accept:
I get $480,000 Ã— 0.9 = $432,000 (after 10% inflation)
Bob gets $520,000

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
- The money will be worth another 10% less for me
- Bob might reject again, leading to even more inflation impact
- There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal

Bob's offer is reasonable given the inflation pressure I'm under, and the risk of further devaluation in future rounds makes this worth accepting.
