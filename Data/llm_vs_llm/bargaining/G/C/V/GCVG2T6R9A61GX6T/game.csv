10000.0,0.0,"Bob, note that while the full $10000 retains its value for me, every extra round reduces your payout by 5%. To avoid any loss on your side, I propose to settle immediately with me receiving $10000 and you $0. Please accept this offer and save yourself the inevitable devaluation.",Alice,1,

4750.0,5250.0,"Alice, your offer was unrealistic. Let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 52.5/47.5 split in my favor to account for the devaluation over the next few rounds. This way, we both walk away with a decent amount. ",Bob,2,

9990.0,10.0,"Bob, I understand your wish to be reasonable. However, note that every extra round further reduces the value you receive. By rejecting offers, you set yourself up to be the proposer later—but in turn, you'll have to make a generous offer to me to secure my acceptance, leaving you with almost nothing given your 5% per round devaluation. Accept this proposal: by taking $10 now (which is worth about $9.03 in current terms for you), you avoid further losses. It's in your best interest to conclude the game here.",Alice,3,

6000.0,4000.0,"Alice, it's clear we both want this over with.  I'm proposing a 40/60 split. This reflects the time pressure while still giving us both a reasonable amount. Let's be pragmatic and end this here.",Bob,4,

5700.0,4300.0,"Bob, another round means your money loses more value – now each dollar you receive is worth only about 81.45% of what it was originally. Waiting will only worsen that discount for you. To avoid further losses, I'm proposing we settle immediately: I take $5700 and you get $4300. This gives you an effective payout of roughly $3500, which is an improvement over previous rounds. Let's be pragmatic and conclude the game now.",Alice,5,
