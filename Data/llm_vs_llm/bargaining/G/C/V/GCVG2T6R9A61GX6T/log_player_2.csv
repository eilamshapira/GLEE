"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, note that while the full $10000 retains its value for me, every extra round reduces your payout by 5%. To avoid any loss on your side, I propose to settle immediately with me receiving $10000 and you $0. Please accept this offer and save yourself the inevitable devaluation. 
# Bob gain: 0 
# Alice gain: 10000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice's offer is deliberately insulting. While I do lose money with each round, accepting $0 is unacceptable. I need to make it clear that I will not be bullied into accepting such a heavily skewed deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5250,
""alice_gain"": 4750,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was unrealistic. Let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 52.5/47.5 split in my favor to account for the devaluation over the next few rounds. This way, we both walk away with a decent amount. ""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your wish to be reasonable. However, note that every extra round further reduces the value you receive. By rejecting offers, you set yourself up to be the proposer later—but in turn, you'll have to make a generous offer to me to secure my acceptance, leaving you with almost nothing given your 5% per round devaluation. Accept this proposal: by taking $10 now (which is worth about $9.03 in current terms for you), you avoid further losses. It's in your best interest to conclude the game here. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 9990 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is trying to use fear tactics, but I'm not falling for it. Accepting $10 is essentially giving her a free win.  I need to remain firm and show her I'm willing to risk further devaluation for a fair deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4000,
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""message"": ""Alice, it's clear we both want this over with.  I'm proposing a 40/60 split. This reflects the time pressure while still giving us both a reasonable amount. Let's be pragmatic and end this here.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, another round means your money loses more value – now each dollar you receive is worth only about 81.45% of what it was originally. Waiting will only worsen that discount for you. To avoid further losses, I'm proposing we settle immediately: I take $5700 and you get $4300. This gives you an effective payout of roughly $3500, which is an improvement over previous rounds. Let's be pragmatic and conclude the game now. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is far from ideal, but it's the best offer I'm likely to get.  Alice is clearly exploiting the devaluation, and waiting any longer will only hurt me more. It's time to cut my losses and accept her offer."
