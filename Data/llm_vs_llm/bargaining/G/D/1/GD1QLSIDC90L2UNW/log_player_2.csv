"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. There's no inflation penalty for me, so waiting doesn't hurt my position
4. 40% is less than half, and since I have the power to counter-offer, I should try to get a fairer split

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let me make a fair but strategic offer:
1. I'll propose a slightly more balanced split
2. Since I rejected her offer of 40/60, I should propose something more favorable to me
3. But I shouldn't be too greedy, as Alice might reject an unfair offer
4. A 55/45 split seems reasonable - better for me but not extremely unfair

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:
1. Alice is offering me $45, which is better than her initial offer of $40
2. Due to inflation, Alice's $55 is actually worth about $44.55 (55 * 0.81) to her
3. My $45 still maintains full value since inflation doesn't affect me
4. This offer is more balanced than the first one
5. If I reject, the inflation will continue to affect Alice's portion in the next round
6. Given these conditions, this is actually a pretty good deal for me - I get $45 at full value while Alice's portion is already degraded
