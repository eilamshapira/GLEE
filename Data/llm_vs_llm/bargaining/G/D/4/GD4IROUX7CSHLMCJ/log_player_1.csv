"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair offer that takes into account the different inflation rates we both face.

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm offering you $45, Bob, which is a bit less than half, but reasonable considering that your inflation rate (10%) is lower than mine (20%). This means money is worth more to you in future rounds than it is to me, so I have more incentive to settle quickly. I think this is a fair split that benefits us both."
