"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer. Alice is offering me $45 and taking $55 for herself. If I reject, I'll be able to make a counter-offer in the next round, but the money will be worth 10% less to me (and 20% less to Alice). 

In the next round, the $100 would effectively be worth $90 to me. If I offer a better split for myself then, Alice might reject, leading to further devaluation for both of us.

Given that the initial offer of $45 is relatively fair (not too far from 50-50) and considering the inflation penalty, I'll accept this offer.
