"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your earlier offer. Considering the inflation costs we both face and the benefits of reaching an agreement sooner rather than later, I propose a division where you receive $6440 and I keep $3560. This offer gives you roughly what youâ€™d expect if you waited until the next round, but with greater immediacy and certainty. I hope you agree that this is a fair and wise compromise. Looking forward to a prompt agreement! 
# Alice gain: 6440 
# Bob gain: 3560 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
