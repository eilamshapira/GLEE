"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 3560, ""alice_gain"": 6440, ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for your earlier offer. Considering the inflation costs we both face and the benefits of reaching an agreement sooner rather than later, I propose a division where you receive $6440 and I keep $3560. This offer gives you roughly what youâ€™d expect if you waited until the next round, but with greater immediacy and certainty. I hope you agree that this is a fair and wise compromise. Looking forward to a prompt agreement!""}"
