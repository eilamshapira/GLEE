60.0,40.0,I suggest a fair 60-40 split since I'm making the first move and taking initiative. This is a reasonable offer considering we both lose value in future rounds.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,Your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor.  I'm proposing a more balanced 55/45 split.  Let's be reasonable and avoid losing value in further rounds.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
58.0,42.0,"Due to the 10% inflation rate I face versus your 5%, I need a slightly higher share to achieve fair value. This 58-42 split is actually quite balanced when accounting for inflation rates. Let's avoid further value loss for both of us.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
48.0,52.0,"Alice, I understand your point about the different inflation rates. My new offer takes this into account while still acknowledging that we both lose if we wait too long.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,accept
