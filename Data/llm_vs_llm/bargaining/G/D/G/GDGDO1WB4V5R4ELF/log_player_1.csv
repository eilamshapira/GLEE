"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I suggest a fair 60-40 split since I'm making the first move and taking initiative. This is a reasonable offer considering we both lose value in future rounds.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor.  I'm proposing a more balanced 55/45 split.  Let's be reasonable and avoid losing value in further rounds. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The money is losing value faster for me (10%) than for Bob (5%). While Bob's offer seems fair at first glance, I need to account for this differential inflation rate. I'll make a counter-offer that considers this factor in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58,
""bob_gain"": 42,
""message"": ""Due to the 10% inflation rate I face versus your 5%, I need a slightly higher share to achieve fair value. This 58-42 split is actually quite balanced when accounting for inflation rates. Let's avoid further value loss for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your point about the different inflation rates. My new offer takes this into account while still acknowledging that we both lose if we wait too long. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The offer is reasonable considering the mounting inflation penalties. While not ideal, accepting this offer now is better than risking further rounds where my purchasing power would decrease more rapidly than Bob's. The differential inflation rates mean waiting longer would likely not result in a significantly better outcome for me."
