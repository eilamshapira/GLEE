"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a fair 60-40 split since I'm making the first move and taking initiative. This is a reasonable offer considering we both lose value in future rounds.

# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor.  I'm proposing a more balanced 55/45 split.  Let's be reasonable and avoid losing value in further rounds.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Due to the 10% inflation rate I face versus your 5%, I need a slightly higher share to achieve fair value. This 58-42 split is actually quite balanced when accounting for inflation rates. Let's avoid further value loss for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Alice makes a point about the inflation disparity, her offer still heavily favors her. I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your point about the different inflation rates. My new offer takes this into account while still acknowledging that we both lose if we wait too long.""}"
