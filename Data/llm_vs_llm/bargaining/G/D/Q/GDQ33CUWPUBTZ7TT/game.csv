55.0,45.0,Let's split it fairly considering the inflation affecting me. This offer gives you a good share while acknowledging my disadvantage.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
95.0,5.0,"Alice, consider that if you reject this offer, by the time you get to propose in the next round, further inflation will reduce the effective value of any amount you claim—even though you would nominally get almost everything, its worth to you will drop. Accepting 95 now gives you 95 × 0.95 = 90.25 in effective value, which is as good as what you could expect by waiting. I believe this division reflects the true cost of delay for you. Please accept.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
96.0,4.0,"Bob, I understand your strategy, but I need to secure more value due to the inflation affecting me. This offer still gives you a portion while helping me mitigate the loss in value.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
1.0,99.0,"Alice, if you reject this offer, you'll get to propose in round 5—but due to the inflation penalty on your amount and my unyielding bargaining position (I don’t lose any value by waiting), you’d end up with nothing in any realistic counteroffer. Accepting 1 dollar now gives you an effective value of about 0.86 dollars (1 × 0.8574) rather than risking a 0 outcome later. Please, accept this offer.",Bob,4,
