Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, consider that if you reject this offer, by the time you get to propose in the next round, further inflation will reduce the effective value of any amount you claim—even though you would nominally get almost everything, its worth to you will drop. Accepting 95 now gives you 95 × 0.95 = 90.25 in effective value, which is as good as what you could expect by waiting. I believe this division reflects the true cost of delay for you. Please accept. 
# Alice gain: 95 
# Bob gain: 5

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, if you reject this offer, you'll get to propose in round 5—but due to the inflation penalty on your amount and my unyielding bargaining position (I don’t lose any value by waiting), you’d end up with nothing in any realistic counteroffer. Accepting 1 dollar now gives you an effective value of about 0.86 dollars (1 × 0.8574) rather than risking a 0 outcome later. Please, accept this offer. 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99
