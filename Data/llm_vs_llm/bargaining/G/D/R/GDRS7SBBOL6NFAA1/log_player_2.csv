"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I understand that Alice is proposing an equal split of $500,000 each. However, I need to consider the inflation effect. If I reject and go to the next round, the money will be worth 10% less to me, meaning my maximum potential value would be $900,000 rather than $1,000,000.

Let me evaluate this offer:
- Current offer: I receive $500,000 (50% of the total)
- If I reject, I can propose next round, but the entire pot is worth 10% less to me
- Making a counter-offer might not lead to a better outcome if Alice also rejects

Since this is a fair 50-50 split and rejecting would immediately reduce my potential value, I'll accept this offer.
