650000.0,350000.0,"Hi Alice, I want to settle quickly to avoid further loss from discounting. Given that money loses more value for me as rounds pass, Iâ€™m proposing a split of $350000 for me and $650000 for you. I believe this fairly reflects our different discount rates and secures our maximum value now. What do you think?",Bob,2,
