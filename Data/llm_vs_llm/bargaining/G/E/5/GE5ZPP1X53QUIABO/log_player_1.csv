"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I want to settle quickly to avoid further loss from discounting. Given that money loses more value for me as rounds pass, Iâ€™m proposing a split of $350000 for me and $650000 for you. I believe this fairly reflects our different discount rates and secures our maximum value now. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 650000 
# Bob gain: 350000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
