Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 350000, ""alice_gain"": 650000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I want to settle quickly to avoid further loss from discounting. Given that money loses more value for me as rounds pass, Iâ€™m proposing a split of $350,000 for me and $650,000 for you. I believe this fairly reflects our different discount rates and secures our maximum value now. What do you think?""}"
