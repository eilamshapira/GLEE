"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split this fairly. I'm offering you $40, which is a good deal considering potential inflation. Let's take this offer and both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to think about this strategically. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100, which means she gets $60. If I reject, the money will be worth 20% less to me in the next round, so the total would effectively be worth $80 to me. If I were to offer a 50-50 split next round, that would be $40 for me (in today's value), which is the same as Alice's current offer.

However, Alice might not accept a 50-50 split in the next round, and we could end up in a back-and-forth that reduces the pot's value. Since we're at the first round and have a reasonable offer, I'll accept to secure a definite gain.
