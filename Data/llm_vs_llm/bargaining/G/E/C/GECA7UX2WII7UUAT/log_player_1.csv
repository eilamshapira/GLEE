"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to agree quickly due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I think we can do better. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. Take it or leave it, inflation is eating away at everything! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The value I would get after inflation (40 * 0.8 = 32) is too low. I'll make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Bob, let's be reasonable. I'm offering you a better split than before. With inflation affecting me by 40% now, this is actually quite generous. We should agree soon before the money loses more value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. 65/35. The money's value is dropping fast. Take it now, or we both get less. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept because with inflation getting worse (48.8% less value now), my $35 is worth about $17.92. If I wait another round, any amount will be worth even less, and Bob seems to be getting more aggressive with his demands. Better to secure something now than risk getting nothing or an even worse deal later."
