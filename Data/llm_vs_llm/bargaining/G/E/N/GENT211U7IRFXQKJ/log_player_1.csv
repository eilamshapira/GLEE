"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer as Alice, considering the inflation rates for both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

Given that inflation affects me more significantly (20% per round) than it affects Bob (5% per round), I'm proposing a slightly favorable split for myself. This offer gives Bob a substantial portion while recognizing that delays would hurt my position more than his. I believe this is a fair initial proposal that acknowledges our different inflation pressures."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer, considering the increasing inflation pressure.

{""alice_gain"": 510000, 
""bob_gain"": 490000}

I'm adjusting my offer to be more favorable to Bob while still ensuring I receive a fair portion. With my 20% inflation rate per round compared to Bob's 5%, further delays would be more detrimental to me. This is a reasonable compromise that gives Bob nearly half the money while still protecting my interests given the inflation asymmetry."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more accommodating offer given the severe inflation impact on my share.

{""alice_gain"": 480000, 
""bob_gain"": 520000}

At this point, inflation has significantly eroded my potential gains (nearly 50% less value than round 1), while Bob's inflation impact is much lower. This offer gives Bob a majority share while still ensuring I receive a meaningful portion. The asymmetric inflation rates make further negotiation increasingly costly for me, so I hope Bob will recognize this as a fair compromise that acknowledges both our positions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000
