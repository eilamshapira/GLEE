"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer for the division of $10,000.

Given that the money loses 5% of its value for me (Alice) each round, I should consider making a fair offer that Bob would accept now, since waiting would reduce the value for me.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an equal split of the money. This is fair and gives us both the same amount, and I avoid the 5% loss that would occur if we moved to another round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new offer considering the ongoing inflation effect.

Since we're now in round 3, if we continue to round 4, the money would be worth 15% less to me. I need to make an offer that's better for Bob than what he proposed, but still fair given the inflation pressure on me.

{""alice_gain"": 4700,
""bob_gain"": 5300}

I'm proposing that I get $4,700 and Bob gets $5,300. This gives Bob more than an equal split while protecting some of my value before further inflation occurs. It's also better for Bob than his previous offer where he would get $5,500, but more fair to me given the time pressure I'm under."
