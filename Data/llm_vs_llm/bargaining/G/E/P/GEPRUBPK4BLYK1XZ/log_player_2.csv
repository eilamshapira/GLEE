"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

Bob's gain: $5,000
Alice's gain: $5,000

This is a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance. However, I need to consider the inflation factor. For me (Bob), the money doesn't lose value in future rounds (0% inflation), but for Alice, it loses 5% value per round.

If I reject and we go to the next round, I could potentially propose a split that's slightly in my favor, since Alice would be facing a 5% reduction in the value of her share.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I'm now making the proposal, I'll take into account the inflation factor. Alice faces a 5% reduction in value each round, while my value remains constant. This gives me some leverage to propose a split slightly in my favor.

Given that Alice is now facing 5% inflation on her share, she should be more inclined to accept a reasonable offer now rather than risk further devaluation.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split because it gives me a slight advantage while still being reasonable enough that Alice should accept it rather than face another round of inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5300 
# Alice gain: 4700 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

Bob's gain: $5,300
Alice's gain: $4,700

Alice has now offered me $5,300, which is better than the 50-50 split she originally offered, but less than my proposal of $5,500. 

I need to consider that:
1. There's no inflation for me (Bob), so the absolute dollar amount remains equally valuable
2. Alice is facing compounding inflation (already at 9.75%)
3. If I reject, I can make another offer, but Alice will face even more inflation in round 4
4. Alice has moved significantly from her initial position

This is a reasonable offer that gives me the majority of the money. While I could potentially get more by rejecting, there's also risk that negotiations could break down or become less favorable.
