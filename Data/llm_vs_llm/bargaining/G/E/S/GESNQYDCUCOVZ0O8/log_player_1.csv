"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6000 and Bob gets $4000. I'm hoping this will be acceptable since it's a decent split, and I'm taking the inflation into consideration for future rounds if we don't agree now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
