55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split considering our different inflation rates. You get 45% which is better than what you'd get after multiple rounds of negotiation due to the inflation effects. Let's settle this now and both walk away happy.",Alice,1,

32.0,68.0,"Alice, I know how the inflation affects us both—your dollars shrink 20% per round while mine only shrink 10%. If we delay further, you'll lose even more value. In round 3 you’d be in control, but the discount would leave you with less in effective terms. To avoid more erosion, I'm offering a 68/32 split in nominal dollars, which gives you 32 (worth 0.8×32 = 25.6 effective) right now. I believe this proposal is fair considering our respective discount factors. Let's settle and both preserve as much value as possible.",Bob,2,

50.0,50.0,"Bob, I appreciate your understanding of our inflation rates, but your previous offer was too skewed. Since we're now in round 3, delaying further hurts both of us. I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. For me, this 50 is worth only 32 in round 1 dollars (50×0.64). If you reject and we go to round 4, any deal becomes less valuable for both of us. Let's agree on this balanced split and end the game efficiently.",Alice,3,
