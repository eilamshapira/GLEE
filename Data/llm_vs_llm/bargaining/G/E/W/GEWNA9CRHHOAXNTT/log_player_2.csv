"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split considering our different inflation rates. You get 45% which is better than what you'd get after multiple rounds of negotiation due to the inflation effects. Let's settle this now and both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 68, ""alice_gain"": 32, ""message"": ""Alice, I know how the inflation affects us both—your dollars shrink 20% per round while mine only shrink 10%. If we delay further, you'll lose even more value. In round 3 you’d be in control, but the discount would leave you with less in effective terms. To avoid more erosion, I'm offering a 68/32 split in nominal dollars, which gives you 32 (worth 0.8×32 = 25.6 effective) right now. I believe this proposal is fair considering our respective discount factors. Let's settle and both preserve as much value as possible.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your understanding of our inflation rates, but your previous offer was too skewed. Since we're now in round 3, delaying further hurts both of us. I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. For me, this 50 is worth only 32 in round 1 dollars (50×0.64). If you reject and we go to round 4, any deal becomes less valuable for both of us. Let's agree on this balanced split and end the game efficiently. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
