I'm proposing a fair split that recognizes time pressure affects you more than me. You'll get $450,000, which is substantial. If we delay and you counter, the next round would reduce your money's value by 10%, making this offer more valuable than a larger share later. Let's agree now and both walk away with a great outcome!""}"

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the time pressure, but I believe a truly fair split is 50-50. This way, we both walk away with an equal share. Let's agree on this and end the game on a fair note.

With 10% inflation affecting only your share each round, delaying hurts you more than me. Your $500K offer from round 2 is already worth only $450K to you now. This $400K offer is worth $360K to you - still substantial. If we continue negotiating, your potential gains decrease each round. Let's be practical and conclude this now.""}"

If we continue this pattern, you'll end up with much less. The longer we negotiate, the stronger my position becomes.
