"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm proposing a fair split that recognizes time pressure affects you more than me. You'll get $450000, which is substantial. If we delay and you counter, the next round would reduce your money's value by 10%, making this offer more valuable than a larger share later. Let's agree now and both walk away with a great outcome!

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your desire for a 50-50 split, but you need to understand the game dynamics. With 10% inflation affecting only your share each round, delaying hurts you more than me. Your $500K offer from round 2 is already worth only $450K to you now. This $400K offer is worth $360K to you - still substantial. If we continue negotiating, your potential gains decrease each round. Let's be practical and conclude this now. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're now in round 5, and inflation has significantly reduced your buying power. Your last offer of $540K is actually worth less than $394K to you now due to the 27.1% inflation. My current offer of $350K is worth about $255K to you, which is still substantial. If we continue this pattern, you'll end up with much less. The longer we negotiate, the stronger my position becomes. Let's conclude this now - you still walk away with a quarter million in effective value. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're now in round 7 with over 40% inflation affecting your share. Your last offer of $570K is worth only about $336K to you now due to inflation. My current offer gives you $300K, which is worth around $177K to you - still a significant amount. If we continue, your effective value will drop even further. The math doesn't favor continued negotiation for you. This is a reasonable offer given the game's dynamics and the round we're in. Let's finalize this deal now.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're now in round 9, and your situation is deteriorating quickly. Your last offer of $600K is actually only worth about $287K to you now due to the 52.17% inflation. My current offer gives you $250K, which translates to approximately $120K in value to you. We have only 3 rounds left, and if we reach round 12 without agreement, we both get nothing. The rational choice is to accept this offer now, as further delays will only decrease your share's value further. This is a fair offer given the game's mechanics and our current position.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is the second-to-last round. Your last offer of $630K is worth only $244K to you now due to 61.26% inflation. If we don't agree in this round or the next, we both get ZERO. My offer gives you $150K, which is about $58K in value to you - not ideal but better than nothing. Next round will be our final chance, and inflation will make your share worth even less. The rational choice is to accept this offer now rather than risk walking away with nothing. This is our reality given the game structure and where we are.
