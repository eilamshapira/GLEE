"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Alice in each round, I'll take that into account for my offer.

For me (Bob), the money is now worth $1,000,000 * 0.95 = $950,000.
For Alice, the money is now worth $1,000,000 * 0.80 = $800,000.

Considering this, my offer is:
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll calculate the actual value of the offer.

The original amount was $1,000,000. Due to inflation, for me (Bob), it's now worth $1,000,000 * (0.95)^2 = $1,000,000 * 0.9025 = $902,500.
For Alice, it's now worth $1,000,000 * (0.80)^2 = $1,000,000 * 0.64 = $640,000.

Alice's offer is $350,000 for me and $650,000 for her. Given the inflation, I'll accept this offer as it seems reasonable.
