"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because it's reasonable enough for Bob to accept, considering that if he rejects, the total amount will decrease by 10% in the next round (down to $900,000). If he rejects, he would need to secure significantly more than $450,000 from the reduced total to make rejection worthwhile."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer:

1. Bob is offering a 50-50 split of the remaining $1,000,000
2. However, due to 10% inflation, the real value of my $500,000 would be $450,000
3. If I reject, we go to round 3 where:
   - The total amount will be worth another 10% less
   - I can make a new offer
   - But we risk further devaluation if no agreement is reached

Given that my original offer wasn't accepted, and this offer gives me a reasonable amount (even with inflation), I'll accept to avoid further devaluation.
