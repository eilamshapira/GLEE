Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even with inflation, accepting $3,500 now is a bad deal for me in the long run.  Here's why:

* **My Target:** I'm aiming for at least a 50/50 split.  
* **Inflation Impact:** While $3,500 is less appealing due to inflation, Alice's share has devalued significantly more (36% vs. my 9.75%). This means she's likely feeling the pressure more than I am.
* **Future Rounds:** By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm willing to wait for a better deal.  Alice may be more open to a more even split in later rounds as the deadline approaches and the value of the money decreases."
