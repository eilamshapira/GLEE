Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's kick this off with an even split of $1,000,000. Accepting now maximizes our value before inflation eats into the pot. Looking forward to your thoughts!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, I think a 60/40 split in my favor is fair considering we're both taking a risk with inflation. Let's get this done before we lose more! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
