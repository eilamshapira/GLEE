"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split reflects a fair division. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""My turn, a bit more balanced, don't you think?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This is a better offer than yours, and the clock is ticking. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $4500 I'd gain is actually worth less than before. However, Alice's offer is still not in my favor. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Due to inflation, the total value of the money is now worth 9.75% * 2 = 19.5% less for me, since this is the second round that I've experienced inflation. However, for simplicity, I'll calculate the inflation effect on my share. The money I gain is worth 10% less after the first round (5% * 2) and another 5% less after the second round I experienced inflation (the third round of the game), and another 5% in this round, so in total 15% less.

{""bob_gain"": 5200, 
""alice_gain"": 4800, 
""message"": ""Let's try to find a middle ground before it's too late""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob. It's a fair deal considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $4900 I'd gain is actually worth approximately $4900 * 0.8145 = $3988.05 in the original value, which is a significant decrease.

Given that this is Alice's final offer and the inflation will continue to decrease the value of my potential gain, I should consider accepting this offer to avoid further losses.
