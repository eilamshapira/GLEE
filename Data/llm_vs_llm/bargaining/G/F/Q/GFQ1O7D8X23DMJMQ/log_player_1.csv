"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a reasonable first offer, considering that time pressure affects me more than Bob due to the 10% inflation per round.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split because:
1. It's slightly in my favor but still fair enough to have a good chance of being accepted
2. If Bob rejects, we move to round 2 where my money is worth 10% less, so I have incentive to make a reasonable first offer
3. It acknowledges that Bob has some negotiating leverage due to the inflation penalty only affecting me"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Bob's offer is a 50-50 split
2. Due to 10% inflation, my $5000 is effectively worth $4500 to me
3. If I reject, we go to round 3 where any money I get will be worth 20% less
4. My previous offer would have given me $5500 (worth $5500)
5. Bob's offer gives me $5000 (worth $4500)
6. If I reject and make a new offer, Bob might reject again, leading to further inflation

Given that the inflation only affects me and the risk of further devaluation is significant, I should accept this reasonable offer.
