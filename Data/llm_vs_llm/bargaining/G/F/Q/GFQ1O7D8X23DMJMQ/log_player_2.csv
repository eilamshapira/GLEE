"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice offered me 4500$ and wants 5500$ for herself
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. For Alice, the money will be worth 10% less next round
4. For me, the value stays the same
5. So in the next round, 5500$ would only be worth 4950$ to Alice

Given this, I believe I can get a better deal by rejecting this offer and making a counter-proposal next round. Alice should be more willing to accept a lower amount due to the 10% depreciation she faces.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll make a strategic counter-offer:

1. Alice faces 10% depreciation each round
2. Alice's original desire for 5500$ would now only be worth 4950$ to her
3. I should offer something that gives me more than the 4500$ I was offered, while still being attractive enough for Alice to accept

I'll propose:

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

This is a fair split that gives me more than Alice's original offer, while still being attractive to Alice because:
1. It's still a substantial amount
2. If she rejects, her next round's value will depreciate further
3. Equal splits are often perceived as fair"
