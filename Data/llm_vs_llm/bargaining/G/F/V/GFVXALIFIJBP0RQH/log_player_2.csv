Let's hold out for a better offer. Alice is starting to increase her share, but the inflation is making each round more costly for us. Hopefully, she'll start to consider that and offer us a more fair split."

While this isn't the best possible split, the effects of inflation are starting to add up significantly. Accepting this offer ensures we walk away with something, even if it's not the majority of the pot. If we keep playing, there's a chance Alice will continue to demand more, and we'll be left with even less due to inflation. Better to secure what we can now."
