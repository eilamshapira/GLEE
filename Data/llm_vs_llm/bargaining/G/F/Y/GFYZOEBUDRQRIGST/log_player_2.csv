"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:
1. Current offer: I get $40, Alice gets $60
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to inflation:
   - My $40 would become worth $36 next round (10% less)
   - Alice's $60 would become worth $48 next round (20% less)
4. This means Alice has more pressure to agree quickly

While I could try to negotiate for a better split, the inflation penalty is significant. However, I think I can get a better deal, and Alice would still be motivated to accept due to her higher inflation rate.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll make a strategic counter-offer:
1. I know Alice faces 20% inflation per round vs my 10%
2. She would want to conclude quickly to avoid larger losses
3. A more balanced split would be fair, but slightly in my favor
4. If she rejects, her next round value drops more than mine

I'll propose a 55-45 split in my favor:

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I propose this fair division where I get a bit more than half, but it's still attractive enough for Alice to accept given her higher inflation pressure."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Current offer: $48 for me, $52 for Alice
2. Due to inflation:
   * My $48 is actually worth $38.88 (48 * 0.81)
   * Alice's $52 is worth $33.28 (52 * 0.64)
3. If I reject:
   * Next round I'll face 29% total inflation (vs current 19%)
   * Alice will face 56% total inflation (vs current 36%)
   * The value will deteriorate significantly for both of us

This is actually a reasonable offer considering:
- It's more balanced than the first offer
- The real value is already significantly reduced
- Another round would hurt both of us substantially
- Alice has moved significantly from her initial position
