"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an initial offer that acknowledges both of our interests in this game.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a reasonable starting point because inflation affects Bob more than me, so earlier agreements are more valuable to him. I think this split respects both of our interests in reaching a timely agreement."
