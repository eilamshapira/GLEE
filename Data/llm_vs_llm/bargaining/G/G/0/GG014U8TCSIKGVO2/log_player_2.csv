"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to think carefully about this offer. 

Alice is offering me $40 out of $100, while taking $60 for herself. Since I'm affected by 20% inflation each round, if I reject and wait until round 2 to make a counter-offer, the total money will effectively be worth only $80 to me. My share would need to exceed $40 to make waiting worthwhile.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2, Alice might still reject my offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation for me. The longer we negotiate, the less the money is worth to me, while its value doesn't decrease for Alice.

Given these considerations, $40 now is better than potentially getting less value later due to inflation.
