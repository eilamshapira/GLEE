"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly and avoid inflation losses! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. It's a fair 50-50 split
2. If I reject, the next round will have 10% inflation, meaning the $100 total will be worth $90 to me
3. Even if I make a more favorable proposal next round, Alice might reject it, leading to further inflation losses
4. A guaranteed $50 now is better than risking lower value in future rounds
