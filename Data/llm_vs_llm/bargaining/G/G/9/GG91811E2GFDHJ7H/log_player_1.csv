"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer to divide the $1,000,000, considering that we both lose value with each passing round, but Bob's loss is higher (20% vs my 10%).

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this division as a fair starting point. You get $450,000 which is substantial, and I'll take $550,000. Given that you'll lose value faster than me if we continue to the next round, this should be an attractive initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me consider this carefully.

If I reject Bob's offer, we move to round 3 where I make the next offer. However, due to inflation:
- The money would be worth 20% less than round 1 for me (another 10% decrease)
- The money would be worth 40% less than round 1 for Bob (another 20% decrease)

Bob is offering me $420,000, which is currently worth 90% of its original value, so equivalent to $378,000 in round 1 terms.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 3, even if Bob accepts, I'd get money at 80% of original value. To match what I'm being offered now, I'd need to secure at least $472,500 in round 3 ($378,000 รท 0.8).

Given the inflation rates and the fact that Bob is losing value faster, I'll accept this offer.
