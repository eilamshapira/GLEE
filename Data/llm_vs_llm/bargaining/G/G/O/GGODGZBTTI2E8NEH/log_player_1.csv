Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since your money loses 20% value each round, this is actually a fair offer. If you reject, your share would be worth even less in the next round. Let's agree now and both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 45

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Consider that your $40 now is better than a larger amount later. With current inflation, if you reject, your money will be worth about 49% less next round. This is the most rational deal for both of us at this point. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60
