"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly considering the inflation affect on me. This offer gives you a good share while acknowledging my disadvantage. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice wants 60% of the money, offering me 40%
2. Her money loses 20% value each round, while mine stays the same
3. If she rejects my next offer, her $60 would be worth only $48 in round 3
4. I'm in a stronger negotiating position due to the inflation factor

Given these factors, I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer. The inflation pressure will make Alice more likely to accept a more favorable split for me in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make an offer that reflects my stronger negotiating position while still being reasonable enough for Alice to accept, given the 20% inflation penalty she faces.

{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Since your money loses 20% value each round, this is actually a fair offer. If you reject, your share would be worth even less in the next round. Let's agree now and both benefit.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This offer gives you a fair share while considering the inflation affect on me. Let's settle now before the value decreases further. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice is offering me 45% and wants 55% for herself
2. Due to inflation, her $55 is actually worth only $35.20 to her (64% of $55)
3. My $45 maintains its full value
4. If I reject, in the next round her money will be worth even less (another 20% reduction)
5. I'm still in a stronger position and can probably get a better deal

Since her money is rapidly losing value, she'll be under more pressure to accept a better offer for me in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Given that Alice's share is now significantly impacted by inflation, I'll make a firmer offer that reflects my stronger position but is still reasonable enough to accept given her declining value.

{""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Consider that your $40 now is better than a larger amount later. With current inflation, if you reject, your money will be worth about 49% less next round. This is the most rational deal for both of us at this point.""}"
