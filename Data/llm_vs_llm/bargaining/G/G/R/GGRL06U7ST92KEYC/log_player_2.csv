"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it evenly, fair for both 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice offers a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
2. However, if I reject, I can make my own offer next round
3. But due to 10% inflation, if I reject, the $5000 I could get now would be worth only $4500 in the next round
4. Even if I make a more aggressive offer next round, the inflation penalty makes it risky
5. A guaranteed $5000 now is better than a potentially higher but depreciated amount later
