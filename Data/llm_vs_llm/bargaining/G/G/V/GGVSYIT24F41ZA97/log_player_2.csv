"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's keep it fair, Bob. We both take $50 each. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

This is the first round, so there's no inflation impact yet. Alice is offering an equal split of $50 each, which is completely fair.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the money will be worth 10% less to me. That means even if I could get more money in absolute terms, I might end up with less value due to inflation.

Given that:
1. The offer is fair (50-50 split)
2. There's no inflation loss in this round
3. Negotiating further could lead to value loss for me
4. There's a risk of getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds
