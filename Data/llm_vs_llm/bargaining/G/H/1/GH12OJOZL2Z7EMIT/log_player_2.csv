"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I get $71.43 and you get $28.57. Accepting now is in your best interest since waiting means you'll incur a 20% devaluation on any money received next round. Letâ€™s settle this fairly and avoid the inflation penalty! 
# Bob gain: 28.57 
# Alice gain: 71.43 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
