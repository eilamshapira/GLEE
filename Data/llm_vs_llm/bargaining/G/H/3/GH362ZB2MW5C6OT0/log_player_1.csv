"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me propose a reasonable split considering the 5% inflation penalty per round that affects my gains.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. This is a fair split that slightly favors me to account for the time pressure I'm under due to inflation. Bob still gets a substantial portion, and we can finish this quickly without losing value to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer as it's too unfavorable for me, especially considering I would only get $4,000 that's already worth 5% less due to inflation. I'll make a more balanced counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me make a slightly more accommodating offer while still protecting myself from the inflation penalty that now stands at 10% for my gains.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}

I'm reducing my requested amount to $5,200 while offering Bob $4,800. This is a more balanced split that accounts for the mounting inflation pressure on my side while giving Bob a very reasonable portion. I hope Bob will recognize this as a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer as it's even worse than Bob's previous offer, giving me only $3,500 that would be worth about 14.26% less due to inflation. Bob is being too aggressive in their demands, and I still have room to negotiate for a fairer split despite the mounting inflation pressure."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","The inflation penalty is becoming significant at around 19% now. I need to adjust my strategy while still maintaining a reasonable position.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a perfectly equal 50-50 split. This is as fair as it gets in absolute terms, and considering the inflation penalty I face, it shows I'm willing to be reasonable. If Bob rejects this balanced offer, it would demonstrate they're not negotiating in good faith. The longer this goes on, the more I lose to inflation, so I hope Bob will recognize this as a fair compromise."
