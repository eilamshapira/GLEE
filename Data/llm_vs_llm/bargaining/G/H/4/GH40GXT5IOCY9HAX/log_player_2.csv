"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me 4500$ out of 10,000$
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 20% inflation per round for me:
   * My 4500$ now would be worth more than any higher amount next round
   * If I get 5000$ next round, it would only be worth 4000$ due to inflation

Since this is a decent first offer and inflation will hurt me more than Alice in future rounds, I should accept.
