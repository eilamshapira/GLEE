"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair is fair! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think through this offer.

Alice is offering a 50/50 split, where we each get $5,000. This is an equal division of the money.

If I reject, we move to the next round where I make an offer, but the total money will be worth 5% less (so $9,500 total). In theory, I could offer myself more in the next round, but Alice might reject, leading to further rounds and more depreciation.

Since this is a fair and equal split with no loss due to inflation, I'll accept.
