"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a more balanced proposal in the next round. While inflation will reduce the total value by 10%, a fairer split would still be better than accepting such an uneven division where I only get 10% of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose a fair 50-50 split. Even with the 10% inflation from the previous round, we would each get $450,000, which is much better than the previous offer where I would only get $100,000. This is a fair and equitable division that benefits both of us."
