"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 400000

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me after the first round, the total amount I'm considering is now $1,000,000 * 0.9 = $900,000. For Alice, it's $1,000,000 * 0.95 = $950,000.

I'll make a proposal that takes into account the decreasing value of the money. I'll offer a 50-50 split of the original $1,000,000, but considering the decreased value.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle of my first offer 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the decreased value of the money for me (19% less) and Alice (9.75% less), I'll evaluate the offer.

The offer is $420,000 for me, but due to the 19% decrease in value, it's effectively worth $420,000 * 0.81 = $339,800.

I'll think about the potential future offers and the decreasing value of the money. For now, I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 19% less for me and 9.75% less for Alice, I'll make a new proposal.

Considering the decreasing value, I'll aim for a slightly more favorable split. I'll offer 45% of the original $1,000,000 to myself and 55% to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""message"": ""Last chance for a reasonable split""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Slightly better than your last offer 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the decreased value of the money for me (34.39% less) and Alice (18.55% less), I'll evaluate the offer.

The offer is $430,000 for me, but due to the 34.39% decrease in value, it's effectively worth $430,000 * 0.6561 = $282,261.

Given the significant decrease in value for me, I'll think about the potential future offers and the risk of getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement. This offer seems slightly better than my previous proposal, but the decreasing value of the money is a major concern.

I'll accept this offer, as it might be the best I can get considering the circumstances.
