"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 4950, ""bob_gain"": 5050, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we settle now with an almost-even split – a slight edge in your favor reflects your lower discount from waiting. Accepting this offer keeps the full value nearly intact for both of us, avoiding unnecessary losses from inflation in later rounds. Let's agree now and avoid the complications of delay!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic. I understand the time pressure, but a 50/50 split just doesn't reflect the fact that I lose less to inflation than you do. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  It's a strong offer that still guarantees you a significant sum. Take this opportunity while it lasts. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I’m not willing to settle for a 40% share when, as the next proposer, I believe I can secure a more favorable division. I’m looking forward to the next round to present my proposal.""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 3600, ""bob_gain"": 6400, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal for round 3: I suggest we settle now with a nominal split of $3,600 for me and $6,400 for you. Factoring today's discount rates (my share at 80% and yours at 90%), this means you'd effectively get about $5,760 while I'd receive around $2,880. Given that waiting further will only worsen the value we both get—and especially hurt my share even more—this offer puts you slightly ahead compared to your expected outcome if you were to wait until round 4. I hope you'll agree that locking in this deal now is in both our best interests.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, but your offer still undervalues my position. Let's be practical - every round that passes hurts you more than it hurts me. I'm proposing 6800 for me and 3200 for you.  This is a fair offer considering the depreciation and gives you a guaranteed payout that lessens with each passing round.  Don't let this opportunity slip away. 
# Alice gain: 3200 
# Bob gain: 6800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, while I understand your point about my pie shrinking faster than yours, a 3200/6800 split still doesn't adequately reflect what's at stake. The depreciation is hitting me significantly harder, and I believe we can find a more balanced compromise if I get the chance to propose the division next round. I appreciate your urgency, but I'm going to have to pass on this offer.""}"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 3400, ""bob_gain"": 6600, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for round 5: I suggest we settle with $3,400 for me and $6,600 for you. At this stage, my share is worth about 65.6% of its face value while yours remains at roughly 81.5%—a gap that only grows with more rounds. This offer recognizes the harsher discount I face and still gives you a strong position, especially since any further delay only chips away at our totals. I believe locking in this division now is in both our best interests. I’m looking forward to your agreement.""}"
