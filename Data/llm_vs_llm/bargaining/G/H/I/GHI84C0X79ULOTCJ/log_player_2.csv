"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we settle now with an almost-even split – a slight edge in your favor reflects your lower discount from waiting. Accepting this offer keeps the full value nearly intact for both of us, avoiding unnecessary losses from inflation in later rounds. Let's agree now and avoid the complications of delay!

# Alice gain: 4950

""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. I understand the time pressure, but a 50/50 split just doesn't reflect the fact that I lose less to inflation than you do. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  It's a strong offer that still guarantees you a significant sum. Take this opportunity while it lasts.""

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal for round 3: I suggest we settle now with a nominal split of $3600 for me and $6400 for you. Factoring today's discount rates (my share at 80% and yours at 90%), this means you'd effectively get about $5760 while I'd receive around $2880. Given that waiting further will only worsen the value we both get—and especially hurt my share even more—this offer puts you slightly ahead compared to your expected outcome if you were to wait until round 4. I hope you'll agree that locking in this deal now is in both our best interests.

Round 4

{
""bob_gain"": 6800,
""alice_gain"": 3200,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, but your offer still undervalues my position. Let's be practical - every round that passes hurts you more than it hurts me. I'm proposing 6800 for me and 3200 for you.  This is a fair offer considering the depreciation and gives you a guaranteed payout that lessens with each passing round.  Don't let this opportunity slip away.""

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for round 5: I suggest we settle with $3400 for me and $6600 for you. At this stage, my share is worth about 65.6% of its face value while yours remains at roughly 81.5%—a gap that only grows with more rounds. This offer recognizes the harsher discount I face and still gives you a strong position, especially since any further delay only chips away at our totals. I believe locking in this division now is in both our best interests. I’m looking forward to your agreement. 
# Bob gain: 6600 
# Alice gain: 3400
