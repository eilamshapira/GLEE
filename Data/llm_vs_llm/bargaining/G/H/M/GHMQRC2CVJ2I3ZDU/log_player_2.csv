"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly down the middle, Bob. 500000 for each of us. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this carefully. Alice is offering a 50-50 split ($500,000 each), which might seem fair at first glance. However, I need to account for the 20% inflation penalty per round.

If I accept now, I get $500,000.
If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, even if I asked for everything ($1,000,000), its value to me would be reduced by 20% to $800,000. And Alice might reject that anyway.

Given the significant inflation penalty and the fact that $500,000 is objectively fair, accepting now maximizes my guaranteed outcome.
