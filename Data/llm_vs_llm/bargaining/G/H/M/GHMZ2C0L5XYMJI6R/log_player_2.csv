"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. This is the first round, so no inflation has occurred yet
2. Alice is offering me 40% ($4000) and keeping 60% ($6000)
3. If I reject, the money will be worth 20% less to me next round
4. In the next round, I could propose a better split, but Alice might reject
5. The 20% inflation penalty means if I wait, my $4000 would be worth $3200 next round

While I might be able to negotiate a better deal, the inflation risk and the possibility of further rejections make this a reasonable offer. It's not ideal, but it's a substantial amount and securing it now avoids inflation losses.
