Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 750000 
# Bob gain: 250000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I need to consider the actual value. 
The original offer for me was 750000, but due to 20% inflation, the value for me is 750000 * 0.8 = 600000.

Considering this, I think the offer is reasonable.
