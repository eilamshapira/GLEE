"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Alice's offer, where I would get $4,000 and she would get $6,000 out of the $10,000 total.

While this isn't an even split, it's a substantial amount. However, since this is only the first round and I have the opportunity to make a counter-offer if I reject, I'll reject this initial proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split that's still favorable to Alice but gives me a bit more than her initial offer.

{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500}

I'm offering Alice $5,500 which is still more than half of the total amount, while I would receive $4,500. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges her initial position while improving my share slightly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice has not only rejected my more balanced offer, but has actually decreased my share from her initial offer ($4,000 → $3,500) while increasing her own share ($6,000 → $6,500). This suggests she's taking a more aggressive negotiating stance.

Since we're only in round 3 of 12 possible rounds, and the offer has gotten worse for me rather than better, I'll reject this offer and try again with my proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I see that Alice is taking a hard stance, actually reducing her initial offer to me. I'll adjust my strategy and present a more balanced offer that's still reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an even 50-50 split, which is the most fair division possible. This gives us both $5,000, and represents a principled position of equality that's easy to justify. This is a standard solution in bargaining situations and should appeal to a sense of fairness."
