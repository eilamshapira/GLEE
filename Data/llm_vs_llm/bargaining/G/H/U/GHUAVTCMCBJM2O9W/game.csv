550000.0,450000.0,I suggest a fair split where I get slightly more to account for potential inflation risks. This is a reasonable offer that benefits both of us.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Given the previous round's proposal, I believe a 55-45 split in my favor is fair. This accounts for the risk I took by rejecting your offer and the potential inflation impact on my side.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Due to the 10% inflation penalty I'm facing each round, I need a larger share to maintain fair value. My effective gain from this offer is only 540000 due to inflation, which is quite reasonable. Let's conclude this quickly before further inflation diminishes our total value.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Considering the inflation impact on your side and the fact that my gains remain unaffected, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This offer takes into account the risks I've taken and the diminishing value you're facing. Let's settle this before the situation worsens for both of us.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
700000.0,300000.0,"With the 34.4% inflation penalty I'm now facing, this offer would actually give me an effective 459200, while you get your full 300000. This is much more balanced than it appears at first glance. Further delays will only make it harder to reach a fair agreement, as my effective gains keep decreasing with inflation.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"Given the significant inflation impact on your side and the fact that my gains remain unaffected, I propose a 65-35 split in my favor. This offer reflects the increasing risk I'm taking with each round and the rapidly diminishing value you're facing. It's crucial we reach an agreement soon to avoid further loss in value for both of us.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
800000.0,200000.0,"With the 46.86% inflation penalty I'm now facing, this offer would actually give me an effective 425120, while you get your full 200000. I'm forced to ask for this higher nominal amount just to maintain a reasonable effective value. If you reject this, both our positions will only get worse. Let's end this now with a deal that's actually fair when accounting for inflation.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"With the severe inflation impact on your side and my gains remaining constant, I propose a 70-30 split in my favor. This reflects the high risk I'm taking and the urgent need to settle before the value diminishes further for both of us. Let's agree on this to ensure we both walk away with something meaningful.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
850000.0,150000.0,"Let's be rational about this. With my 56.95% inflation penalty, this offer gives me an effective 366925, while you get your full 150000. We only have 3 rounds left after this. If we don't reach an agreement soon, we both get nothing. This offer gives us both meaningful value - please consider it carefully.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
250000.0,750000.0,"With only three rounds left and the severe inflation impact on your side, I propose a 75-25 split in my favor. This is a critical moment; if we don't agree soon, we risk losing everything. This offer ensures I get a fair share given the risks I've taken, while still providing you with a significant amount considering your inflation penalty.",Bob,10,
