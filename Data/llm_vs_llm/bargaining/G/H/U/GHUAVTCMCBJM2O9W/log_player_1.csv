"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the previous round's proposal, I believe a 55-45 split in my favor is fair. This accounts for the risk I took by rejecting your offer and the potential inflation impact on my side. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The value I would receive is effectively 450000 * 0.9 = 405000 due to inflation, which is significantly lower than what I proposed. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."

""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Due to the 10% inflation penalty I'm facing each round, I need a larger share to maintain fair value. My effective gain from this offer is only 540,000 due to inflation, which is quite reasonable. Let's conclude this quickly before further inflation diminishes our total value.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation impact on your side and the fact that my gains remain unaffected, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This offer takes into account the risks I've taken and the diminishing value you're facing. Let's settle this before the situation worsens for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

With 27.1% inflation, I would effectively receive only 400000 * 0.729 = 291,600, which is far too low. Bob's increasingly aggressive offers despite knowing about my inflation penalty suggests I need to continue negotiating for a fairer split."

""alice_gain"": 700000,

""message"": ""With the 34.4% inflation penalty I'm now facing, this offer would actually give me an effective 459,200, while you get your full 300,000. This is much more balanced than it appears at first glance. Further delays will only make it harder to reach a fair agreement, as my effective gains keep decreasing with inflation.""

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the significant inflation impact on your side and the fact that my gains remain unaffected, I propose a 65-35 split in my favor. This offer reflects the increasing risk I'm taking with each round and the rapidly diminishing value you're facing. It's crucial we reach an agreement soon to avoid further loss in value for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

With 40.95% inflation, I would effectively receive only 350000 * 0.5905 = 206,675, which is getting extremely low. Bob seems to be taking advantage of my inflation penalty by offering increasingly unfavorable terms. I need to continue negotiating for a fairer split, even though time is working against me."

Round 7

""message"": ""With the 46.86% inflation penalty I'm now facing, this offer would actually give me an effective 425,120, while you get your full 200,000. I'm forced to ask for this higher nominal amount just to maintain a reasonable effective value. If you reject this, both our positions will only get worse. Let's end this now with a deal that's actually fair when accounting for inflation.""

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: With the severe inflation impact on your side and my gains remaining constant, I propose a 70-30 split in my favor. This reflects the high risk I'm taking and the urgent need to settle before the value diminishes further for both of us. Let's agree on this to ensure we both walk away with something meaningful. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

With 52.17% inflation, I would effectively receive only 300000 * 0.4783 = 143,490, which is extremely low. Even though we're getting into dangerous territory with only 4 rounds left and increasing inflation, this offer is too unfair given that Bob's value isn't affected by inflation. I'll make one more attempt at a reasonable compromise."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 850000,
""bob_gain"": 150000,
""message"": ""Let's be rational about this. With my 56.95% inflation penalty, this offer gives me an effective 366,925, while you get your full 150,000. We only have 3 rounds left after this.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: With only three rounds left and the severe inflation impact on your side, I propose a 75-25 split in my favor. This is a critical moment; if we don't agree soon, we risk losing everything. This offer ensures I get a fair share given the risks I've taken, while still providing you with a significant amount considering your inflation penalty. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

With only 2 rounds left after this and inflation at 61.26%, I would receive 250000 * 0.3874 = 96,850. While this is a very low amount, Bob's negotiation strategy and the inflation penalties have put me in a difficult position. If I reject this, there's a high risk we'll get nothing at all, as the remaining rounds would leave me with even less effective value and Bob might not accept my counter-offers. Better to secure some value than risk getting nothing."
