Round 3

# Alice's message: Due to the 10% inflation penalty I'm facing each round, I need a larger share to maintain fair value. My effective gain from this offer is only 540000 due to inflation, which is quite reasonable. Let's conclude this quickly before further inflation diminishes our total value.

Alice's offer:

This is much more balanced than it appears at first glance. Further delays will only make it harder to reach a fair agreement, as my effective gains keep decreasing with inflation.
