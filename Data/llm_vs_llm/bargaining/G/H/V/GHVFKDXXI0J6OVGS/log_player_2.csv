"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. This is the first round, so no inflation has occurred yet
2. Alice is offering me 4000$ (40%) and keeping 6000$ (60%)
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 20% less to me
4. My 4000$ now is worth more than 4000$ in future rounds due to inflation
5. However, this split seems a bit unfair in Alice's favor

Given that each round reduces my purchasing power by 20%, and this is a decent initial offer (though not great), I'll accept.
