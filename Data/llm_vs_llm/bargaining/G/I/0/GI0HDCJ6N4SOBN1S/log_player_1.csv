"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split where I get 55% and you get 45%. This is a reasonable offer that gives us both a substantial amount.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe an equal 50/50 split is the fairest solution. This gives us both $500000. The 5% inflation affects me each round, so I'd like to resolve this quickly with a fair and equal division that benefits us both substantially. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Bob's offer is slightly lower than my initial proposal for myself
2. Bob has revealed that inflation affects him by 5% each round
3. If I reject, I can make another offer in the next round, but Bob's portion will be worth 5% less again
4. The offer is perfectly equal, which is objectively fair
5. We still have 10 rounds left, but continuing the game might lead to diminishing returns for both of us

Given that it's a reasonable offer and we're early in the game, I'll accept this offer.
