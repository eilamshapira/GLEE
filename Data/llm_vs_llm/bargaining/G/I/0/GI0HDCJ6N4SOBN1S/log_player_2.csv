"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split where I get 55% and you get 45%. This is a reasonable offer that gives us both a substantial amount. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $450,000 (45%) while she gets $550,000 (55%). 

Given that inflation reduces my money's value by 5% each round, if I reject now and we go to another round, I'd need to secure more than $450,000 รท 0.95 = $473,684 to make rejection worthwhile.

While her offer isn't exactly equal, it's reasonably close, and there's risk in rejection. If negotiations drag on for multiple rounds, inflation will significantly hurt my position, and there's always the risk of getting nothing if we reach round 12 without agreement.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counterproposal that acknowledges the inflation factor while aiming for a fairer split.

""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe an equal 50/50 split is the fairest solution. This gives us both $500,000. The 5% inflation affects me each round, so I'd like to resolve this quickly with a fair and equal division that benefits us both substantially.""}"
