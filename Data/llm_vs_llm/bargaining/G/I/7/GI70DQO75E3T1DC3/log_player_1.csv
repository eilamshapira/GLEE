"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I should make a strategic first offer, considering that inflation affects me more severely (20% per round) than Bob (5% per round). I want to secure a good deal while giving Bob enough incentive to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a reasonable first offer that gives me a good portion while still being fair enough that Bob might accept it rather than risk inflation eating into both our gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Due to inflation, if I accept this 50-50 split now:
   * My $50 is worth 20% less → Effective value = $40
   * Bob's $50 is worth 5% less → Effective value = $47.50

2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make another offer
   * But inflation will hit even harder (40% total for me, 10% for Bob)
   * This makes future negotiations less favorable

3. While the 50-50 split might seem fair nominally, due to the different inflation rates, I'm actually getting less value than Bob.

However, given that:
- The inflation rate difference is significant (20% vs 5%)
- Future rounds will only worsen my position
- The current offer gives me a reasonable amount

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer now rather than risk getting an even worse deal in future rounds due to the asymmetric inflation rates working against me."
