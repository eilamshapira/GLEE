"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a fair split where we each receive $500000. I believe this is a good starting point for a smooth and balanced agreement. Looking forward to your decision! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer:

Alice is proposing an even 50-50 split where we each get $500,000. This is a perfectly fair division that gives each of us exactly half of the total amount.

Since this is completely equitable and I have no strategic advantage in rejecting and making a counter-offer (as Alice could similarly reject my offer in the next round), accepting this fair split is the rational choice.
