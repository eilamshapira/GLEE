"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer that takes into account the inflation rates for both players. Since Bob's money loses value faster (10% per round) compared to mine (5% per round), he has more incentive to accept an early offer.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this 60-40 split because:
1. It's a reasonable offer that gives Bob a substantial portion
2. If Bob refuses, his next round's money will be worth 10% less, while mine only 5% less
3. This creates pressure to accept now rather than continue negotiating"
