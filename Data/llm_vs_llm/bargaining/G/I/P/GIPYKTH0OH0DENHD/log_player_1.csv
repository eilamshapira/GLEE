Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your fair approach. However, I would like to propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This still ensures you receive a substantial amount, and it aligns more with my current needs. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000

I understand your perspective and want us both to feel satisfied with the eventual split.

I hope we can agree on this compromise and finalize our deal.""}"
