"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
- She's offering me $40 out of $100
- While this isn't an even split, it's a reasonable offer
- There's no inflation penalty for me, but I don't know if Alice faces any
- If I reject, I can make a counter-offer, but Alice might reject it
- $40 is a meaningful amount that I can lock in now

I'll accept this offer. It's not ideal but it's fair enough and avoids the risk of a negotiation breakdown.
