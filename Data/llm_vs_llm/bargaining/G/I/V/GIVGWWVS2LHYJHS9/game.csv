6500.0,3500.0,"Alice, in light of the inflation hitting my share each round and to keep things moving quickly, I’m offering you $6500 and keeping $3500 for myself. I believe this compensates you well while helping me avoid further loss in value. Let’s agree now before the pie shrinks any further.",Bob,2,
