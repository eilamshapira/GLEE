Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, in light of the inflation hitting my share each round and to keep things moving quickly, I’m offering you $6500 and keeping $3500 for myself. I believe this compensates you well while helping me avoid further loss in value. Let’s agree now before the pie shrinks any further. 
# Alice gain: 6500 
# Bob gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
