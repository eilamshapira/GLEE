Round 2

I believe this compensates you well while helping me avoid further loss in value. Let’s agree now before the pie shrinks any further.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, inflation is eating away at our potential gains. I'm adjusting my offer to reflect this reality. I'm offering you a slightly larger share this time to incentivize a quick agreement. Let's settle this before the value drops further! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
