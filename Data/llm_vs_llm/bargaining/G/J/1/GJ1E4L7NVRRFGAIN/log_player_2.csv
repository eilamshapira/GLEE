"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the rules.

Here's my thought process:

*   **Initial Value:** $500,000 in round 1.
*   **Inflation Impact:** My money loses 20% of its value each round.

Since this is the first round and the split is 50/50, I should accept this offer. Even with inflation in later rounds, I'm unlikely to get a significantly better deal, and risking many rounds could erode the value of any gains I might make. Also, I don't know the value of money for Alice, so she can be stubborn to split this amount.
