"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer gives me only 10% of the total amount, which is quite low, especially considering inflation will decrease the value of the money by 5% each round. However, if I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but the total value will be 5% less for me.

Let me analyze this: If I reject, I can propose a more favorable split in the next round, but I'll be dividing $950,000 in value (from my perspective due to 5% inflation).

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more balanced division that acknowledges both my need for a fair share and Alice's demonstrated desire for a larger portion.

{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000}

I'm offering you a 60-40 split in your favor. This is much more equitable than your initial proposal while still giving you the majority of the funds. Given the 5% inflation penalty I face with each round, it's important we reach an agreement soon that works for both of us."
