"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I hope you're ready to secure our deal early. I propose a fair 50/50 split of the million dollars to ensure neither of us loses value from inflation. Let's agree now and both walk away happy. â€“Alice 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering an even 50/50 split, which would give me $500,000. However, with the 20% inflation affecting me each round, waiting could significantly reduce the real value of any future amount I receive.

If I reject and make a counteroffer next round, even if I ask for more, the 20% inflation means I'd need to get at least $625,000 in round 2 to match the current $500,000 offer's value.

Given the substantial inflation risk and that 50% is a traditionally fair split, this seems like a reasonable offer.
