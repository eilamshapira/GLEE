524000.0,476000.0,"Hi Bob! I suggest we split the money fairly considering the inflation. I'll take 524k and you get 476k. This is actually an equal split when accounting for your 5% inflation per round. If we drag this out, we both lose value. Let's make a deal now!",Alice,1,

525000.0,475000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your consideration of inflation, but I believe we can find a more balanced split. My proposal is 475k for me and 525k for you. This is slightly more in your favor than your last offer, but it also accounts for the inflation I'm facing. Let's settle this soon to avoid further value loss!",Bob,2,
