"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 524000, ""bob_gain"": 476000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob! I suggest we split the money fairly considering the inflation. I'll take 524k and you get 476k. This is actually an equal split when accounting for your 5% inflation per round. If we drag this out, we both lose value. Let's make a deal now!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your consideration of inflation, but I believe we can find a more balanced split. My proposal is 475k for me and 525k for you. This is slightly more in your favor than your last offer, but it also accounts for the inflation I'm facing. Let's settle this soon to avoid further value loss! 
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
