"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I'm ready. Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, considering the inflation and Bob's offer:

My money is now worth 5% less, so the effective value of $40 is lower than before. Bob's money is worth 20% less.

Given the decrease in value and the limited number of rounds, I will accept.
