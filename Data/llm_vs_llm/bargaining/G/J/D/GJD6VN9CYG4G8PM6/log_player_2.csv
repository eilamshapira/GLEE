"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that any delay costs me significantly while your share remains unaffected. To avoid an unnecessary loss on my part and to settle this quickly, I'm offering you the entire $1000000 right away. I hope you'll agree that it's best to conclude the deal now, and I look forward to your acceptance. 
# Bob gain: 1000000 
# Alice gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me the entire $1,000,000, which is the maximum amount I could possibly get. Since there's no inflation penalty for me in future rounds, I could theoretically reject and try to negotiate, but:

1. This is already the best possible outcome for me
2. Any delay would hurt Alice's position due to her 10% inflation penalty
3. There's no strategic advantage in rejecting what is essentially a perfect offer from my perspective
4. Prolonging the negotiation would only risk potentially worse outcomes

Therefore, I should absolutely accept this offer.
