"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think this through:

1. Current offer: I get $30, Alice gets $70
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
   * The money will be worth 20% less to me
   * A $100 split will only be worth $80 to me
   * Even if I propose a more favorable split, I'll lose value due to inflation

While $30 isn't a great split, if I reject and wait, I'd need to get at least $37.50 in the next round just to break even ($37.50 * 0.8 = $30).

Given the inflation penalty and uncertainty about Alice's inflation rate, I'll accept this offer. Getting $30 now is better than risking further devaluation.
