"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
* Alice is offering me $20, keeping $80 for herself
* If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
* However, due to 20% inflation, $100 will be worth $80 for me next round
* This means my maximum potential gain would be significantly reduced

Since the inflation rate severely impacts my potential future gains and Alice's offer gives me something, albeit small, I should probably accept.

However, given that:
1. Alice's offer is quite unfair (20-80 split)
2. Even with 20% inflation, I could still propose a more favorable split next round
3. Alice only faces 5% inflation, so she has incentive to still accept a reasonable offer

I'll reject this and make a counter-offer next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let me think strategically:
* For me, the $100 is now worth $80 due to 20% inflation
* For Alice, it's worth $95 due to 5% inflation
* I need to make an offer that's attractive enough for Alice to accept, considering:
  - She knows my inflation rate is higher than hers
  - She could reject and make another offer next round
  - I'd be in a worse position if she rejects

I'll propose a more balanced split that gives Alice enough incentive to accept while improving my position from her initial offer.

{""bob_gain"": 40, ""alice_gain"": 60}

I propose this split because:
1. It's more equitable than the initial 20-80 offer
2. Alice still gets a majority share
3. Given the inflation rates, Alice would get $60 now vs. potentially less in future rounds if we keep negotiating
4. It's a reasonable compromise that acknowledges our different inflation rates"
