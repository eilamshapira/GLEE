"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll offer a slightly more favorable split for myself considering Bob's higher time pressure due to the 20% inflation he faces each round.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

Let me explain my reasoning: Since Bob loses 20% of the value each round while I face no inflation penalty, waiting is more costly for him than for me. This fair split acknowledges this dynamic while still giving Bob a substantial portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll adjust my offer to be more favorable for Bob while still accounting for his time pressure from inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm offering a more balanced split that's closer to 50-50, while still recognizing that I have a slight negotiating advantage due to Bob's inflation penalty. This represents a compromise from my initial offer, showing I'm willing to be reasonable while still advocating for my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a more accommodating offer since Bob is facing significant inflation penalties already.

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}

I'm moving closer to an even split, acknowledging that Bob has now faced multiple rounds of inflation. This offer is more favorable to Bob than my previous proposals while still giving me a slight advantage. I hope we can reach an agreement soon before Bob loses too much value to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering we're now in round 7 and Bob's inflation penalty is quite significant, I'll make a more generous offer to try to reach an agreement.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm now offering an even 50-50 split. This is a fair division that acknowledges Bob's increasing inflation penalty while still protecting my interests. I hope we can agree on this balanced proposal and conclude our negotiation."
