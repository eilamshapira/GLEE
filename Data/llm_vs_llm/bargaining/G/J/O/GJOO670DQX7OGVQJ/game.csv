450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing we settle now with a near‐fair division. Since each passing round costs me 10% of value, I'd prefer we agree immediately. I offer you $550000 and take $450000 – a generous division that reflects my urgent need to avoid inflation. I hope you find this arrangement acceptable so we can both secure our shares without delay.",Alice,1,

500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I'm willing to take a equal share. Let's settle this fairly and quickly to minimize the effects of inflation for both of us.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, while an equal split sounds fair at first glance, I must consider the inflation penalty I face. In round 2, I'm effectively receiving $500000 at 10% discount—about $450000 in round‐1 dollars—whereas if I have the chance to propose in round 3, I might craft an offer that better compensates for my lower inflation rate. I appreciate your push for fairness, but given how these devaluations work in our game, I believe waiting another round could yield a more advantageous outcome for me. So I must reject this proposal.",Alice,2,reject
428571.0,571429.0,"Hi Bob, considering our inflation hurdles, I’ve thought carefully about our next step. In round 3, my share is now worth 20% less than round 1, and based on what we’ve seen, you might be looking at an even steeper devaluation if we wait further. To give you an incentive to settle now and to counteract any potential losses from further rounds, I’m offering you $571429 while I take $428571. This split is designed so that if you accept now, you secure a value that rivals or exceeds what you’d effectively get if we delayed—minimizing our overall inflation losses. I hope you see the mutual benefit in wrapping this up promptly. Looking forward to your agreement.",Alice,3,

480000.0,520000.0,"Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I still believe in a more balanced split. Let's settle this fairly to minimize the effects of inflation for both of us. I hope you accept this offer.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, I appreciate your effort to propose a balanced split despite our differing inflation rates. Though nominally I'm receiving $480000, under round 4 conditions that amounts to about 72.9% of round‐1 value—roughly $349920 for me. Given that waiting further will only exacerbate my devaluation, this offer represents a reasonable compromise and an incentive to settle now. I'm happy to accept this offer so that we both minimize our losses to inflation.",Alice,4,accept
