"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing we settle now with a near‐fair division. Since each passing round costs me 10% of value, I'd prefer we agree immediately. I offer you $550000 and take $450000 – a generous division that reflects my urgent need to avoid inflation. I hope you find this arrangement acceptable so we can both secure our shares without delay. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, considering our inflation hurdles, I’ve thought carefully about our next step. In round 3, my share is now worth 20% less than round 1, and based on what we’ve seen, you might be looking at an even steeper devaluation if we wait further. To give you an incentive to settle now and to counteract any potential losses from further rounds, I’m offering you $571429 while I take $428571. This split is designed so that if you accept now, you secure a value that rivals or exceeds what you’d effectively get if we delayed—minimizing our overall inflation losses. I hope you see the mutual benefit in wrapping this up promptly. Looking forward to your agreement. 
# Bob gain: 571429 
# Alice gain: 428571
