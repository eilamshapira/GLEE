"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 6429 
# Alice gain: 3571 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer. 

Alice is offering:
- Bob (me): $6,429
- Alice: $3,571

This is about a 64.3% / 35.7% split, which gives me the larger share. 

Since this is just the first round, I need to consider if I should hold out for a better deal or accept. If I reject, we move to round 2 where my offer would be worth 10% less to me, and Alice's would be worth 20% less to her. These different inflation rates are important to consider.

Given that I have the majority share already and that waiting would reduce the value for both of us (especially for Alice), this seems like a reasonable first offer.
