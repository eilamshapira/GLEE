"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I'm Alice, I need to maximize my earnings considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money.

Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

My reasoning: I'm starting aggressively, demanding a slightly larger share. I need to account for the steep inflation hitting both of us, but especially Bob. This initial offer gives me a solid foundation and leaves Bob with a reasonable amount to consider in light of his inflation rate. If he rejects, I will consider that he may be aiming for an unreasonable share, and I will adjust to a more balanced proposal in the next round."
