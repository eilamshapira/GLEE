"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze this offer. I would receive $4000. Since this is round 1, the money is worth its full value to me right now. If I reject, I risk the money depreciating by 20% each round. Let's see if I can get a better deal later. However, since Alice's money is also depreciating, it may not be worth the risk.

I will accept for now, to avoid the risk of losing more money.
