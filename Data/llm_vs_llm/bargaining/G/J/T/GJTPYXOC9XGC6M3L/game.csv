8000.0,2000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing an 80/20 split considering our different inflation rates. Since you face 20% inflation each round and I don't, waiting would reduce your purchasing power. If you reject, in the next round your $10000 would only be worth $8000 to you. This offer gives you $2000 now, which is fair given the circumstances.",Alice,1,

5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, I understand the inflation factor, but your initial offer was too low. I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. Even with the 20% inflation affecting me, I'm still getting $4000 in real value (5000 * 0.8), which is much better than your offer of $2000. This is a reasonable compromise - we both walk away with equal nominal amounts.",Bob,2,
