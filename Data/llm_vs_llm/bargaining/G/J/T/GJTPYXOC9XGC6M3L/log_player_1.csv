"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll analyze this strategic game considering the inflation rates (0% for me, 20% for Bob) and make a fair proposal to Bob.

Let me think about the optimal strategy:
- This is an ultimatum game with alternating offers.
- Bob faces 20% inflation per round, so waiting is costly for him.
- I face no inflation, so I can be patient.
- If we reach round 2, Bob would propose a split that's favorable to him, but accounting for my 0% inflation rate.

Given this dynamic, I should propose a split that's better than what Bob would get if he rejected and made a counter-offer in the next round.

""bob_gain"": 2000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing an 80/20 split considering our different inflation rates. Since you face 20% inflation each round and I don't, waiting would reduce your purchasing power. If you reject, in the next round your $10,000 would only be worth $8,000 to you. This offer gives you $2,000 now, which is fair given the circumstances.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the inflation factor, but your initial offer was too low. I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. Even with the 20% inflation affecting me, I'm still getting $4000 in real value (5000 * 0.8), which is much better than your offer of $2000. This is a reasonable compromise - we both walk away with equal nominal amounts. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Bob's counteroffer carefully, considering our different inflation positions.

Bob is offering a 50-50 split ($5000 each). For me, with no inflation, this is worth the full $5000. This is significantly better than my initial offer of keeping $8000 for myself.

If I reject and we go to round 3, I could propose another split, but Bob would face another 20% inflation, making the money worth only 64% of the original value to him. However, there's no guarantee he would accept my next offer either, potentially leading to more rounds and diminishing total value.

Given that Bob's current offer provides me with $5000 (which is quite reasonable in a fair division scenario) and avoids further negotiation rounds, I'll accept this offer.
