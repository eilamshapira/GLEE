"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing an 80/20 split considering our different inflation rates. Since you face 20% inflation each round and I don't, waiting would reduce your purchasing power. If you reject, in the next round your $10000 would only be worth $8000 to you. This offer gives you $2000 now, which is fair given the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Current offer: $2000 for me, $8000 for Alice
2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make an offer
   * But the money will be worth 20% less to me
   * $10000 * 0.8 = $8000 total value for me next round

While Alice is correct about the inflation affecting me, her offer of $2000 is quite low. Even with the 20% inflation penalty, I would be better off rejecting and making a counter-offer next round. With $8000 worth of purchasing power next round, I could propose a more favorable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a strategic counter-offer, considering both our positions:

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the inflation factor, but your initial offer was too low. I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. Even with the 20% inflation affecting me, I'm still getting $4000 in real value (5000 * 0.8), which is much better than your offer of $2000. This is a reasonable compromise - we both walk away with equal nominal amounts.""}"
