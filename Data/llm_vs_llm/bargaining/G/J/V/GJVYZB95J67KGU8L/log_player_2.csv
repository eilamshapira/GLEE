"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a fair 50/50 split: $5000 for you and $5000 for me. Settling in round 1 avoids any inflation penalty on my share, so I hope you find this offer attractive. Letâ€™s wrap this up quickly and fairly! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that inflation reduces the money's value by 5% each round for me, accepting Alice's offer now means I get $5,000 at full value. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, even if I ask for more, the value would be affected by the 5% inflation. A 50/50 split is generally considered fair, and avoiding the inflation penalty is beneficial for me.
