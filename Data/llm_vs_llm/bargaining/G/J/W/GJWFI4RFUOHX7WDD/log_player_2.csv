"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 0 
# Alice gain: 1000000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a counter-offer in the next round that's more fair. Even with the 10% inflation penalty, getting $0 is the worst possible outcome for me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is generous to me but still gives Alice a substantial portion. Given that I face 10% inflation penalty per round while Alice doesn't, I need to secure a good deal now. If Alice rejects this, she risks getting a worse deal in the next round when I would face a 20% total inflation penalty, which would incentivize me to demand even more to compensate for my losses."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make another counter-offer. Even with 19% inflation, getting just $1 is still essentially worthless, so I have nothing to lose by continuing to negotiate. Alice seems to be playing very aggressively, but she should realize that a more balanced split would be better for both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}

I'm increasing my demand to 70-30 split because I need to compensate for the increasing inflation penalty (which will be 27.1% next round if we continue). Alice needs to understand that further delays will only make me demand even more to offset my losses. This is still a reasonable offer as Alice would get $300,000 with no inflation penalty, and we could both end this game now with significant gains."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation pressure by consistently offering me virtually nothing ($1), hoping I'll eventually give in. However, even with 34.39% inflation, accepting $1 is worse than continuing to negotiate. I'll make another counter-offer where I'll need to demand even more to compensate for the mounting inflation penalties. Alice's strategy of offering $1 repeatedly is not constructive for reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000}

I'm now proposing an 80-20 split because I need to compensate for the severe inflation penalty (which will be 40.95% next round if we continue). Alice's repeated $1 offers show she's trying to wear me down with inflation, so I must increase my demands to maintain a reasonable final value. Even with this aggressive split, Alice still gets $200,000 with no penalty, while my $800,000 will be worth much less due to accumulated inflation. If Alice continues to reject reasonable offers, we're both risking worse outcomes - I'll need to demand even more next time to offset inflation, and she risks getting less in my future offers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 478300 
# Alice gain: 521700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. With the 46.86% inflation penalty, my $478,300 will be worth about $254,147 in original value, while continuing to negotiate would subject me to even higher inflation penalties. This is the first reasonable offer Alice has made, and given the mounting inflation pressure, it's better to accept this now than risk further deterioration of value in future rounds."
