Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose a fair split that slightly favors me as the current proposer. Given that we both face inflation penalties, it's in our interest to reach an agreement soon. This is much more balanced than your initial offer. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
