"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be efficient, Bob. Take this offer and let's both walk away happy. I think it's fair given my perspective. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $100,000 and keeping $900,000
2. This is a very uneven split (10% - 90%)
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
4. However, inflation will reduce my money's value by 10% next round
5. The inflation penalty affects me more than Alice (10% vs 5%)
6. Still, even with inflation, I could propose a much more favorable split next round

Given the highly uneven split and that we have plenty of rounds left, I'll reject this offer. I can propose a more balanced split next round, and even with the 10% inflation penalty, I should be able to get a better outcome.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer, acknowledging that we both face inflation penalties but mine is higher:

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, I propose a fair split that slightly favors me as the current proposer. Given that we both face inflation penalties, it's in our interest to reach an agreement soon. This is much more balanced than your initial offer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I rejected your offer, and now it's my turn. I'm giving you a very generous offer this round, as I know the value of money is shrinking. This should be acceptable! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is now offering a 40%-60% split, which is much more reasonable than her first offer
2. The inflation penalty means my $400,000 is actually worth $324,000 (81% of original value)
3. If I reject:
   - Next round I can make an offer, but my money will be worth 27.1% less
   - Alice's inflation penalty is increasing more slowly
4. This offer is significantly better than her first one
5. The inflation penalties are starting to become significant
6. The split is within a reasonable range

Given that:
- The offer is much more balanced
- Inflation is eating into our potential gains
- Further negotiations might lead to worse outcomes due to compounding inflation
- This is actually a decent offer considering the current circumstances
