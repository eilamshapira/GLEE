"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I believe a 50-50 split is the most fair division for both of us. This way we both get an equal share of $5000, which is substantial for both parties. Equal splits are the standard for fairness in most negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
