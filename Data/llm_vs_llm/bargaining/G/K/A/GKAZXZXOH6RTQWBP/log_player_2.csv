"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I made the first move and took the initiative. This is still a fair offer that leaves you with a substantial amount. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing I get $4,000 while she takes $6,000, justifying the uneven split based on her making the first move.

While I could accept this and secure $4,000 immediately, I think we can reach a more equitable arrangement. Since we have multiple rounds available, I'll make a counter-proposal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I believe a 50-50 split is the most fair division for both of us. This way we both get an equal share of $5,000, which is substantial for both parties. Equal splits are the standard for fairness in most negotiations. What do you think?""}"
