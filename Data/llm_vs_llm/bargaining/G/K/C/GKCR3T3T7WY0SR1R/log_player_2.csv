Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000

Even with the inflation, accepting $4,000 is a worse outcome for me than holding out for a potential offer of $4,800 (which would be the equivalent of $6,000 pre-inflation) in the next round."

Round 4

This offer attempts to find a middle ground where I gain more than Alice's previous offer while still leaving her with a reasonable amount that might entice her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 7000

Alice is getting greedier, but I still have a chance to get more.  Accepting $3,000 now is less than the potential $3,360 I could gain by offering her $6,640 in the next round (which, after two rounds of inflation, would be worth $7,000 to her)."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4640, ""alice_gain"": 5360}

I'll make one last attempt to secure a decent amount. This offer is a slight increase for her from the previous round, and hopefully, she'll see it as a reasonable compromise before inflation eats further into the potential gains."
