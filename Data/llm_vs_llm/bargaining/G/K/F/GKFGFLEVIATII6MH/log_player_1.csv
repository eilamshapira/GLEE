"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since you face a 5% inflation penalty per round and I don't, we should reach an agreement quickly. This split recognizes your time pressure while being fair to both of us. If we delay further, your share becomes worth less to you, so this is actually a good deal considering the circumstances.

# Bob gain: 600000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your improved offer. Let's try to meet in the middle here. This offer gives you $420000 now, which is better than waiting more rounds where inflation will continue to reduce your effective gain. At the current 5% inflation per round, delaying further significantly hurts your return. This is a fair deal considering our different inflation rates, and I hope we can agree and conclude our negotiation.

# Bob gain: 580000
