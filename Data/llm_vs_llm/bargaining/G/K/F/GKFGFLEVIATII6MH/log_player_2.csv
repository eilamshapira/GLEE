"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a bit more as a gesture of goodwill to reach a quick agreement. Let's both walk away with a great deal! 
# Bob gain: 525000 
# Alice gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to think about whether Alice's offer is fair. She's offering me $525,000 while she takes $475,000. That's about 52.5% for me and 47.5% for her.

Given that with each passing round, the money loses 5% of its value for Alice but keeps the same value for me, I have a strategic advantage by waiting. If we go to the next round, I can make a counter-offer, and the total value will be worth less to Alice, which might make her more willing to accept a better deal for me.

Since this is only round 1 of 12 possible rounds, and I'm not facing any inflation penalty, I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make an offer that acknowledges the time pressure Alice faces with the 5% inflation penalty while being fair to both of us.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, since you face a 5% inflation penalty per round and I don't, we should reach an agreement quickly. This split recognizes your time pressure while being fair to both of us. If we delay further, your share becomes worth less to you, so this is actually a good deal considering the circumstances.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation issue, so I am making this offer where you get a bigger share. Let's agree quickly before inflation reduces my effective gain even more. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's new offer. She's now offering me $550,000 (55%) while she takes $450,000 (45%).

This is an improvement from her first offer, but not as good as what I proposed. The key factor is the inflation penalty that only affects Alice. After 3 rounds, her share is already worth 9.75% less to her, so her $450,000 is effectively worth about $406,125 to her.

Since we still have 9 rounds left, and each round decreases the value of her money by 5%, I have leverage to potentially get a better deal. However, I also need to be careful not to push too hard and end up with nothing if we can't agree by round 12.

Given that her offer has improved but still doesn't fully account for the inflation asymmetry, I'll reject this offer and make a slightly more favorable counter-proposal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 580000, 
""alice_gain"": 420000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your improved offer. Let's try to meet in the middle here. This offer gives you $420,000 now, which is better than waiting more rounds where inflation will continue to reduce your effective gain. At the current 5% inflation per round, delaying further significantly hurts your return. This is a fair deal considering our different inflation rates, and I hope we can agree and conclude our negotiation.""}"
