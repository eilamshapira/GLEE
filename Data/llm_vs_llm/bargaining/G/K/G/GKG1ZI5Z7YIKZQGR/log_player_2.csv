"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40 in my favor. It's a fair start considering the inflation affects you more. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Alice's offer acknowledges the inflation, a 60-40 split in the first round heavily favors her. I'm willing to negotiate, but not from such a disadvantaged position."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I understand the inflation puts me at a disadvantage, but 60-40 is too skewed. How about we start with 55-45 in my favor and work from there?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. 55-45 in my favor. Considering the inflation, this is a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is just a repeat of her previous offer, ignoring my counter-proposal.  The inflation is a factor, but not enough to accept such an uneven split this early in the game. Alice is clearly trying to pressure me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 525000, ""alice_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""This is a negotiation, Alice. I'm willing to move a bit, but you need to meet me halfway. 52.5-47.5 seems like a reasonable compromise given the circumstances.""}"
