"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I need to consider the actual value I'll get. 
20% of 40 is 8, so the value I'll get is 40 - 8 = 32.
Considering this, I don't think it's a fair offer.
{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less in each round, and this is the second reduction for me, I'll calculate the value I'll actually get:
20% of the initial amount is reduced twice: 
First reduction: 20% of 100 is 20, so 100 - 20 = 80
Second reduction: 20% of 80 is 16, so 80 - 16 = 64
To get a fair share, I should aim for a higher initial amount, considering the reduced value.
Let's propose:
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 48.8% less, I need to consider the actual value I'll get. 
48.8% of 30 is approximately 14.64, so the value I'll get is 30 - 14.64 = 15.36.
Considering this, I don't think it's a fair offer, but I should also think about the next round and how much more the inflation will affect me.
{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money I gain is worth 48.8% less in the previous round, and this is the third reduction for me, I'll calculate the value I'll actually get:
20% of the initial amount is reduced three times: 
First reduction: 20% of 100 is 20, so 100 - 20 = 80
Second reduction: 20% of 80 is 16, so 80 - 16 = 64
Third reduction: 20% of 64 is 12.8, so 64 - 12.8 = 51.2
To get a fair share, I should aim for a higher initial amount, considering the reduced value.
However, I should also be aware that the more rounds we go, the less my share will be worth due to inflation. 
Let's propose a more generous offer to Bob to try to end the game:
{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60}"
