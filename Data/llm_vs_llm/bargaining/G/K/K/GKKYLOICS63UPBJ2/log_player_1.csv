"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since Bob has the power to counter-offer.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest a 55-45 split in my favor, which gives Bob a very reasonable portion while maintaining a small advantage for myself. I want to start with a fair offer that's likely to be accepted, considering that delay due to rejection will cost me 5% per round due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Due to inflation, if I accept now:
   * My $50 is worth $47.50 (5% less)
   * Bob's $50 is worth $40 (20% less)
2. This is actually a decent offer considering:
   * It's a fair 50-50 split of the nominal amount
   * The inflation is hitting Bob harder than me
   * Further delays will reduce value for both of us
   * I can still get a good real value ($47.50)

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because it gives me a fair real value, and continuing the negotiation would only reduce the money's worth further due to inflation."
