Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I think a slightly adjusted split is fairer, considering the value decay. Let's do 5300 for me and 4700 for you. It's a small adjustment that still addresses inflation concerns for both of us and gets us closer to a deal.

# Alice gain: 5300
