51.74,48.26,"Hi Bob, here’s my proposal: I take $51.74 and you get $48.26. Considering that with each round the total value drops by 20%, waiting hurts us both. I believe this division reflects the fair equilibrium‐outcome if we account for the discounting over the 12 rounds. Let’s agree now and avoid any unnecessary loss of value.",Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your reasoning, but I think your offer was slightly biased. Considering the discounting, I'm willing to take a bit more to compensate for the potential loss in future rounds. Let's settle on 55-45 and avoid further losses.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, for round 3 my proposal is as follows: I take $55 and you get $45. With each round the total value declines by 20%, so delaying only hurts both of us. In fact, if you reject and get to propose in the next round, your best outcome (when discounted) would be roughly equivalent. Accepting now secures you a slightly better payoff than waiting. Let's finalize this deal and avoid further loss of value.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
42.0,58.0,"Hi Alice, I see you've shifted your offer, but I still think I can get a better deal. Since the value is declining rapidly, I'm willing to take a bit more risk. I'll offer 58-42, and I believe it's still better for you to accept now rather than waiting for the next round.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
55.56,44.44,"Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for round 5: I receive $55.56 while you get $44.44. If you reject, you'll have the chance to propose in round 6, but given the 20% discount that applies in every round, your best alternative turns out to be equivalent to about $44.44 in round 5 terms. I believe this split reflects our best continuation values and helps us avoid further value loss. Let’s settle now before the pie shrinks any more!",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
40.0,60.0,"Hi Alice, I see you're trying to make a strong case, but I'm not convinced. Given the rapid decline in value, I'm willing to push my luck a bit further. I'll offer 60-40, and I think it's still a relatively fair split considering the circumstances. Let's see if we can settle on this before the value drops even further.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
20.0,80.0,"Hi Bob, here's my proposal for round 7. Given the heavy discounting, every round we delay costs us in real value. If you reject this offer, you'll have the chance to propose in round 8. However, in round 8 the money is worth even less (only about 80% of what it is in round 7), so your best continuation payoff equates to roughly $80 (nominal) in round 7 terms. Therefore, offering you $80 now leaves you no worse off than waiting while avoiding further losses due to inflation. I urge you to accept this proposal to lock in our current value.",Alice,7,
