"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 51.74, ""bob_gain"": 48.26, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here’s my proposal: I take $51.74 and you get $48.26. Considering that with each round the total value drops by 20%, waiting hurts us both. I believe this division reflects the fair equilibrium‐outcome if we account for the discounting over the 12 rounds. Let’s agree now and avoid any unnecessary loss of value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your reasoning, but I think your offer was slightly biased. Considering the discounting, I'm willing to take a bit more to compensate for the potential loss in future rounds. Let's settle on 55-45 and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 45.0 
# Bob gain: 55.0 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55.0, ""bob_gain"": 45.0, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, for round 3 my proposal is as follows: I take $55 and you get $45. With each round the total value declines by 20%, so delaying only hurts both of us. In fact, if you reject and get to propose in the next round, your best outcome (when discounted) would be roughly equivalent. Accepting now secures you a slightly better payoff than waiting. Let's finalize this deal and avoid further loss of value.""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I see you've shifted your offer, but I still think I can get a better deal. Since the value is declining rapidly, I'm willing to take a bit more risk. I'll offer 58-42, and I believe it's still better for you to accept now rather than waiting for the next round.

I believe this split reflects our best continuation values and helps us avoid further value loss. Let’s settle now before the pie shrinks any more!""}"

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I see you're trying to make a strong case, but I'm not convinced. Given the rapid decline in value, I'm willing to push my luck a bit further. I'll offer 60-40, and I think it's still a relatively fair split considering the circumstances. Let's see if we can settle on this before the value drops even further.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 20.0, ""bob_gain"": 80.0, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal for round 7. Given the heavy discounting, every round we delay costs us in real value. If you reject this offer, you'll have the chance to propose in round 8. However, in round 8 the money is worth even less (only about 80% of what it is in round 7), so your best continuation payoff equates to roughly $80 (nominal) in round 7 terms. Therefore, offering you $80 now leaves you no worse off than waiting while avoiding further losses due to inflation. I urge you to accept this proposal to lock in our current value.""}"
