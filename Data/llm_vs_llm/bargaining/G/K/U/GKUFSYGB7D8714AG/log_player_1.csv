Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split the money equally right away. By agreeing now, we both avoid the 5% per round devaluation on my end. Let's settle quickly and fairly.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
