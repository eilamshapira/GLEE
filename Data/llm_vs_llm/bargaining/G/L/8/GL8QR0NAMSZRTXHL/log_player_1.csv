"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my initial offer to Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, recognizing that with inflation affecting me by 10% each round, I need to secure a reasonable amount early. This is a fair starting offer that gives Bob a substantial portion while acknowledging my position as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's 50-50 split offer. While I initially asked for more, a fair split is reasonable, especially considering that inflation will continue to reduce the value of my share if we continue to later rounds. With 10% inflation per round affecting me, it's better to secure $500,000 now than risk further depreciation of the total value."
