"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 262144 
# Alice gain: 737856 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully given the inflation factor for me.

Alice is offering me $262,144, with her taking $737,856. This seems quite uneven, with Alice getting almost 3 times what I would receive. 

I need to remember that with each rejected round, my money loses 20% of its value. So if I reject now and make a counter-offer, I'm already dealing with $800,000 in effective value for the next round.

Given that I have 12 total rounds and this aggressive inflation rate only affects me, I should try to negotiate a better deal, but can't wait too long.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer that accounts for the inflation pressure I face.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing an even 50-50 split of the money. This is fair and reasonable for both of us, and given that I face a 20% inflation penalty with each round while Alice faces no such penalty, it makes sense to reach an equitable agreement quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 327680 
# Alice gain: 672320 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Alice has increased her offer to me from $262,144 to $327,680, which is an improvement. However, I need to consider the inflation factor carefully.

Currently, in round 3, my money is worth 36% less than in round 1. If I reject this offer, in the next round my money will be worth 48.8% less (1 - 0.8^4).

Let's analyze:
- Alice's current offer to me: $327,680
- After 36% inflation, this is worth: $327,680 Ã— 0.64 = $209,715 in original value

If I make another counter-offer and Alice accepts in the next round, my purchasing power would be significantly reduced.

Given the accelerating inflation that only affects me, and the fact that Alice has moved toward a more favorable division, I'll accept this offer.
