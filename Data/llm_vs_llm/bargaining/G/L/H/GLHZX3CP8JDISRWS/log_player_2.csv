"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. It's the first round, so there's no inflation impact yet
2. Alice is offering me 45% of the total ($4,500)
3. If I reject:
   - Next round I can make an offer
   - But Alice's money will be worth 10% less and mine 5% less
   - Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to more inflation

While I could try to negotiate for a better deal, the offer is fairly reasonable and the risk of value loss through inflation makes accepting now attractive. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush.
