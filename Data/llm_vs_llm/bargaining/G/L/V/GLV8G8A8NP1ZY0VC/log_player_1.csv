"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000,""bob_gain"": 4000,""message"": ""I believe this is a fair split for both of us. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. Since you face a 5% inflation penalty per round and I don't, it's in your interest to agree now rather than continue negotiating. This equal division respects both our positions. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
