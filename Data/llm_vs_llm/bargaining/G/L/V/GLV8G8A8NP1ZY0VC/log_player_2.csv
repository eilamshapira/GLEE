"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I believe this is a fair split for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000. This isn't an equal split. 

Since there's no inflation penalty for me (0%), I don't lose value by rejecting and moving to the next round. However, Alice faces a 5% inflation penalty per round, meaning her money would be worth less if we continue.

Given these dynamics, I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-proposal in the next round. Alice has an incentive to accept a more favorable offer to me rather than lose more value to inflation.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more equitable offer that accounts for our different inflation rates.

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. Since you face a 5% inflation penalty per round and I don't, it's in your interest to agree now rather than continue negotiating. This equal division respects both our positions.""}"
