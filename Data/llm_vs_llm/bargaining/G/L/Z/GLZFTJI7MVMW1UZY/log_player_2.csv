Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is hurting me! I need a little more to offset my losses. This is a serious offer. 
# Bob gain: 3700 
# Alice gain: 6300 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is even worse than her first one for me, considering the inflation hasn't affected me yet. I need to signal I'm serious about getting a fair deal."
