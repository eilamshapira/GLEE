"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a fair 60-40 split in my favor, considering I'm making the first move and taking initiative in starting our negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer of a 60-40 split in her favor.

If I reject this offer, I'll make a counter-proposal in the next round, but the total money will be worth 5% less to me (only $95 value to me). If we keep going back and forth, the value continues to decrease for me with each round.

While I'd prefer a more even split, getting $40 now is better than potentially getting less value in future rounds due to inflation.
