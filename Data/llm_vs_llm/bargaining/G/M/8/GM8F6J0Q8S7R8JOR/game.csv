264908.0,735092.0,"Hi Bob, here's my proposal for an immediate agreement: I take $264908 and you get $735092. I’ve worked out the math by looking ahead to round 12 (where you’d be in the driver’s seat but face a 5% per‐round depreciation) and then backwards. In equilibrium, if both of us act rationally over our 12 rounds, you’d expect to get about $773781 when it’s your turn—though that would be discounted by 5% in round 2. This offer gives you roughly what you’d expect by waiting, but without any further loss from depreciation. I believe this is a fair deal for us both. Let’s settle now and avoid the inevitable discount on your share!",Alice,1,

50000.0,950000.0,"Alice, I appreciate your offer but it's not quite fair to me. Since we're playing this game, it makes more sense to aim for a bigger share given the depreciation we're facing.  I propose a split of $950000 for me and $50000 for you. I'm confident this is a fairer offer and I believe we can reach a compromise by the end of these 12 rounds.",Bob,2,

226219.0,773781.0,"Hi Bob, in round 3 I’m offering you $773781 (nominal) and keeping $226219 for myself. Here’s my reasoning: If you reject, you’ll get to propose in round 4. Based on backward‐induction (taking into account your 5% per round depreciation), the equilibrium outcome from round 4 would leave you with a nominal share of $814506.25. However, because money you receive in round 4 is worth only 0.857375 of its face value compared to round 1, your effective value would be 0.857375×814506.25. To be indifferent between accepting now and waiting for your turn, I’ve adjusted my offer so that 0.9025 (the current discount factor for you in round 3) times your share equals that future effective payoff — which works out to about $773781 nominal. Accept this offer now to avoid further depreciation on your share.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
100000.0,900000.0,"Alice, I understand your calculations, but I'm still not comfortable with such an uneven split.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to see a larger share for myself. I'm offering $900000 for me and $100000 for you. This is a much fairer offer than your previous proposals, and I believe it shows my willingness to reach a compromise.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, your offer gives me only $100000, which is far below what I can expect if I propose in the next round. Given that my money isn’t depreciating and knowing that further rounds will only reduce your effective value even more, I believe I can secure a more favorable split by waiting. I look forward to reaching a fair compromise, but for now, I must reject your proposal.",Alice,4,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"Hi Bob, in this round 5 proposal I’m offering you a nominal share of $700000 and keeping $300000 for myself. Remember that by now your money is worth only about 81.45% of its face value compared to round 1, so your effective payoff if you accept now is roughly 0.81451 × 700000 ≃ 570000. If you wait until round 6 to propose your own division, further rounds will only worsen your effective gain because your money will be discounted even more (down to about 77.38% in round 6). Based on a backward-induction analysis and factoring in these depreciation effects, this offer gives you the same effective value you’d expect by waiting, but without any additional loss. I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us. I look forward to settling this now.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
150000.0,850000.0,"Alice, while I appreciate your attempt to be fair, I'm not willing to accept a split that leaves me with such a small share. I'm offering $850000 for me and $150000 for you. This is a significant improvement over your previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the current state of the game.",Bob,6,
,,"Bob, while I appreciate you trying to move towards a more balanced split given the depreciation on your end, the $150000 you're offering me is still lower than what I can expect to secure when it's my turn in round 7. My money remains at full value, and by proposing next round I can design a division that better reflects the bargaining power shift in my favor. I must therefore reject your offer in hopes of achieving a more acceptable outcome for both of us later on.",Alice,6,reject
142857.0,857143.0,"Hi Bob, here’s my proposal in round 7: I will take $142857 and you get $857143. Let me explain: If you reject my offer, you’ll become the proposer in round 8. Based on our game’s structure and the inflation penalty on your money (5% per round, which compounds so that in round 8 your money is worth (0.95)^7 ≈ 0.69834 of its nominal value), you can guarantee yourself an outcome of about $902500 nominal in round 8. That would give you an effective value of 902500 × 0.69834 ≈ $630000. In round 7, your money is discounted by (0.95)^6 ≈ 0.73509, so to make you indifferent between accepting now and waiting, you need a nominal payoff x such that x × 0.73509 = 630000, which yields x ≈ 857143. This offer preserves your continuation payoff while allowing us to settle now before further depreciation occurs. I believe it’s a fair split given the circumstances. Looking forward to your agreement!",Alice,7,

100000.0,900000.0,"Alice, it's getting tight, but I'm still not comfortable with such a small share. I'm offering $900000 for me and $100000 for you. This is a generous offer given the situation, and I believe it's the best way to ensure we both get something before the money depreciates further.",Bob,8,
,,"Bob, while I appreciate your effort, I cannot accept an offer that gives me just $100000 when I can expect a better outcome by waiting until round 9 to propose. In round 9, I'll have the advantage of setting the terms again while your money is discounted even further (around 66.34% of its face value), which means I can structure a division that leaves you with a continuation value similar to what you'd get if you locked in a favorable deal now. By waiting one more round, I can secure a more balanced split that better reflects our respective positions given the inflation on your end. For these reasons, I must reject your current proposal.",Alice,8,reject
97500.0,902500.0,"Hi Bob, in round 9 I’m proposing the following split: I keep $97500 and you get $902500. Here’s my reasoning: At this point, your money is worth about 66.34% of its face value (since 0.95^8 ≈ 0.66342). If you choose to reject my proposal, you'll make the next proposal in round 10, where your money will be discounted even further (to about 63.02% of its nominal value, since 0.95^9 ≈ 0.63025). In round 10, as proposer, you could guarantee yourself nearly all of the $1000000 except for what you’d have to offer me to get my agreement. Based on our backward-induction analysis, your continuation value as proposer in round 10 comes out to be about an effective $598738. To give you exactly this value in round 9—when your discount factor is 0.66342—I’ve calculated that you need to receive a nominal amount of roughly $902500 (since 902500 × 0.66342 ≈ 598738). I hope this shows that by accepting now, you secure the same effective payoff as waiting, but without incurring additional depreciation. I look forward to your acceptance.",Alice,9,

50000.0,950000.0,"Alice, we're running out of time, and the value of my money is dropping fast. I'm offering $950000 for me and $50000 for you. This is a significant share for you, and I believe it's the best way to avoid us both getting nothing. It's time to compromise.",Bob,10,
,,"Bob, I appreciate you trying to close the gap, but I must reject your offer. In round 10 you’re offering me $50000, but if I wait until round 11 I can propose a division that will give me a higher effective payoff—without any depreciation on my side—while still ensuring that you get a continuation value that is more attractive than what you’d get with further rounds. Given that your money is depreciating even more in subsequent rounds, it’s in both our interests to secure a deal that’s closer to our fair continuation values. I look forward to our next round, where I believe I can propose a more balanced split.",Alice,10,reject
50000.0,950000.0,"Hi Bob, here’s my proposal in round 11: I’ll take $50000 and you’ll receive $950000. Here’s my reasoning: If you reject this offer, you’ll be the proposer in round 12. In the final round you could essentially claim nearly all of the $1000000 nominal, but because of inflation your money would be worth only about 56.88% of its face value (roughly, since the discount for you in round 12 is approximately 1 – 0.43 = 0.57). This means that by waiting, your effective payoff would be around $1000000 × 0.57 = ~$570000. In round 11, while my share is full value, the money you receive is discounted by about 59.87% (0.95^10 ≈ 0.5987), so to make you indifferent between accepting now or waiting, your nominal payoff in this round, when multiplied by 0.5987, should equal your continuation value of roughly $570000. Solving 0.5987 × X ≈ 570000 gives X ≈ 950000. By accepting this deal, you secure an effective value of about 950000 × 0.5987 ≈ $570000 without risking further depreciation. I believe this is a fair and logical outcome given our situation. Looking forward to your acceptance.",Alice,11,
