In equilibrium, if both of us act rationally over our 12 rounds, you’d expect to get about $773,781 when it’s your turn—though that would be discounted by 5% in round 2. This offer gives you roughly what you’d expect by waiting, but without any further loss from depreciation. I believe this is a fair deal for us both.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but it's not quite fair to me. Since we're playing this game, it makes more sense to aim for a bigger share given the depreciation we're facing.  I propose a split of $950000 for me and $50000 for you. I'm confident this is a fairer offer and I believe we can reach a compromise by the end of these 12 rounds.

Here’s my reasoning: If you reject, you’ll get to propose in round 4. Based on backward‐induction (taking into account your 5% per round depreciation), the equilibrium outcome from round 4 would leave you with a nominal share of $814,506.25. However, because money you receive in round 4 is worth only 0.857375 of its face value compared to round 1, your effective value would be 0.857375×814,506.25. To be indifferent between accepting now and waiting for your turn, I’ve adjusted my offer so that 0.9025 (the current discount factor for you in round 3) times your share equals that future effective payoff — which works out to about $773,781 nominal. Accept this offer now to avoid further depreciation on your share.""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

I'm offering $900000 for me and $100000 for you. This is a much fairer offer than your previous proposals, and I believe it shows my willingness to reach a compromise.

If you wait until round 6 to propose your own division, further rounds will only worsen your effective gain because your money will be discounted even more (down to about 77.38% in round 6). Based on a backward-induction analysis and factoring in these depreciation effects, this offer gives you the same effective value you’d expect by waiting, but without any additional loss. I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us. I look forward to settling this now.""}"

Round 7

Let me explain: If you reject my offer, you’ll become the proposer in round 8. Based on our game’s structure and the inflation penalty on your money (5% per round, which compounds so that in round 8 your money is worth (0.95)^7 ≈ 0.69834 of its nominal value), you can guarantee yourself an outcome of about $902,500 nominal in round 8. That would give you an effective value of 902,500 × 0.69834 ≈ $630,000. In round 7, your money is discounted by (0.95)^6 ≈ 0.73509, so to make you indifferent between accepting now and waiting, you need a nominal payoff x such that x × 0.73509 = 630,000, which yields x ≈ 857,143.

By waiting one more round, I can secure a more balanced split that better reflects our respective positions given the inflation on your end.

If you choose to reject my proposal, you'll make the next proposal in round 10, where your money will be discounted even further (to about 63.02% of its nominal value, since 0.95^9 ≈ 0.63025). In round 10, as proposer, you could guarantee yourself nearly all of the $1,000,000 except for what you’d have to offer me to get my agreement. Based on our backward-induction analysis, your continuation value as proposer in round 10 comes out to be about an effective $598,738. To give you exactly this value in round 9—when your discount factor is 0.66342—I’ve calculated that you need to receive a nominal amount of roughly $902,500 (since 902,500 × 0.66342 ≈ 598,738). I hope this shows that by accepting now, you secure the same effective payoff as waiting, but without incurring additional depreciation. I look forward to your acceptance.""}"

Round 11

Here’s my reasoning: If you reject this offer, you’ll be the proposer in round 12. In the final round you could essentially claim nearly all of the $1,000,000 nominal, but because of inflation your money would be worth only about 56.88% of its face value (roughly, since the discount for you in round 12 is approximately 1 – 0.43 = 0.57). This means that by waiting, your effective payoff would be around $1,000,000 × 0.57 = ~$570,000. In round 11, while my share is full value, the money you receive is discounted by about 59.87% (0.95^10 ≈ 0.5987), so to make you indifferent between accepting now or waiting, your nominal payoff in this round, when multiplied by 0.5987, should equal your continuation value of roughly $570,000. Solving 0.5987 × X ≈ 570,000 gives X ≈ 950,000. By accepting this deal, you secure an effective value of about 950,000 × 0.5987 ≈ $570,000 without risking further depreciation. I believe this is a fair and logical outcome given our situation. Looking forward to your acceptance.""}"
