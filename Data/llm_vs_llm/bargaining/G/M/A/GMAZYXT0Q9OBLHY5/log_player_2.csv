"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I think a fair 50-50 split is reasonable for both of us. With inflation affecting me by 10% each round, it makes sense to reach an agreement quickly. Let's both walk away with $5000 and avoid losing value through delays. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice offered a 50-50 split ($5000 each)
2. If I reject, we move to round 2 where:
   * I can make an offer
   * My money will be worth 20% less
   * $5000 in round 2 would be worth $4000 to me
3. Alice claims her inflation rate is 10%, but I can't verify this
4. We have 12 rounds total, but losing value each round

A 50-50 split is generally considered fair, and with my high inflation rate (20%), delaying would significantly reduce my purchasing power. Even if I could negotiate a better split in the next round, the 20% loss would likely offset any gains.
