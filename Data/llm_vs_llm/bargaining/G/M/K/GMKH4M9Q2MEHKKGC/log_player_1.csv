"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a reasonable first offer, considering the inflation risk for future rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this split because:
1. It gives me a solid majority while still being fair enough that Bob might accept
2. If Bob refuses, my next opportunity will be worth 20% less to me
3. It's not so extreme that it would likely trigger revenge behavior"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Bob's offer would give me $4500
2. Due to 20% inflation, this $4500 is actually worth $3600 to me (4500 * 0.8)
3. If I reject, we go to round 3 where:
   - I can make a new offer
   - But any amount I get will be worth only 64% of original value (0.8 * 0.8)
   - This means even if I got $6000 in round 3, it would only be worth $3840 to me

Since $3600 (current offer's real value) is not much less than what I could reasonably expect in the next round after inflation, and rejecting would risk getting even less...
