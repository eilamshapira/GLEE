5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Alice, I think a 50/50 split is the fairest approach. We both face time pressure with inflation, so let's agree to an equal division and conclude this negotiation efficiently. This way we both walk away with a fair share.",Bob,2,

4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, I notice you're facing higher inflation than I am (19% vs my 9.75%), which means time is more costly for you. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor, which actually gives you more value than continuing to negotiate further rounds where your inflation will increase even more. Let's conclude this now before both our shares decrease further in value.",Bob,4,
