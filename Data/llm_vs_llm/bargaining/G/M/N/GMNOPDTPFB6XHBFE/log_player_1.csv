# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I notice you're facing higher inflation than I am (19% vs my 9.75%), which means time is more costly for you. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor, which actually gives you more value than continuing to negotiate further rounds where your inflation will increase even more. Let's conclude this now before both our shares decrease further in value. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500
