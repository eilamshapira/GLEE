"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a strategic first offer, considering that Bob's money loses 5% value each round while mine doesn't depreciate. This gives me some negotiating leverage, as Bob might be more inclined to accept a reasonable offer now rather than risk getting less value later.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a firm but not overly aggressive opening offer, giving Bob a substantial share while acknowledging my stronger position due to the inflation mechanics."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
1. Bob is offering me $525,000, which maintains its full value
2. Bob would get $475,000, but due to 5% inflation, it's actually worth $451,250 to him
3. If I reject, we go to another round where I can make an offer, but Bob's portion will be worth even less to him
4. The offer gives me more than half (52.5%) which is fair
5. This is a reasonable improvement from Bob compared to my initial offer

Given that it's a fair offer and that prolonging the negotiation might make it harder to reach a mutually beneficial agreement due to Bob's inflation penalty, I'll accept.
