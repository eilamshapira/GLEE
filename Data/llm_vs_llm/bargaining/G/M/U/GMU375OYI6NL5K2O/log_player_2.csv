"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. It's a 50-50 split which seems fair at first glance
2. However, if I reject this offer, the money will be worth 10% less for me in the next round
3. Alice has no inflation penalty, so she might be incentivized to drag this out
4. Getting $5000 now is better than getting a similar or slightly higher amount later due to the inflation penalty
5. This is a reasonable first offer that gives me half of the total amount
