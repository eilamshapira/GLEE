"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects our positions in the game. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a tempting offer from Alice, but it's the first round, and she gets the lion's share. I think I can negotiate a better deal. Let's see what she proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm aiming for a slightly more balanced split. Let's see what you think of this.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. I came down a bit, but this split acknowledges that I made the first move. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is slightly better than my offer in the previous round, and the value is only going to decrease with each round.  Alice has made it clear she won't go much lower. It's better to accept a decent offer now than risk getting nothing later."
