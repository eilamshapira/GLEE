"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that we're dividing $10,000 and considering the 5% depreciation per round for me (Bob), I should think carefully about this first offer.

Alice has proposed a 50-50 split, which would give me $5,000. This is a fair starting point in many negotiation contexts. However, I need to consider that if I reject and make a counter-offer, Alice might reject it, and then my share would be worth 5% less in the next round.

If I accept now, I get $5,000 with full value. If I reject and negotiations extend multiple rounds, even if I eventually get more than $5,000, the inflation penalty might make it worth less than accepting now.

Given the risk of inflation and the reasonable fairness of a 50-50 split, I'll accept this offer.
