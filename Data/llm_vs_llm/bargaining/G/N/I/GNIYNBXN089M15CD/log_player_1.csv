"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make my offer for the first round. Since we both want to maximize our gain and Bob faces a 10% discount per round, I should propose an offer that's fair but also considers our time preferences.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest this division because we both benefit from an early agreement. While I could wait for later rounds to potentially gain more, this is a reasonable split that gives Bob a substantial portion while allowing me to get a bit more. Let's resolve this quickly so that Bob doesn't lose value due to his 10% discount rate."
