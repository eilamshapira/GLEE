"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this carefully. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100, which means a 40/60 split in her favor. 

If I reject and make a counteroffer next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation. So $100 would effectively be worth $80 to me in the next round. If I were to get, say, $50 in the next round, it would actually be worth $40 to me because of inflation.

Given that Alice's current offer gives me $40, and waiting a round would mean I'd need to secure more than $50 just to break even (due to the 20% inflation), I think accepting is reasonable.
