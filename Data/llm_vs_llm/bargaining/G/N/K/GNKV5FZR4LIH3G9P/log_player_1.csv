"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, as it's important to start with a reasonable offer that has a good chance of being accepted.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

A 50-50 split is fair and equitable for both parties. Since I know the money's value doesn't decrease for me over time, but I'm uncertain about Bob's inflation rate, it's best to make a fair offer that could be accepted immediately rather than risk going to further rounds."
