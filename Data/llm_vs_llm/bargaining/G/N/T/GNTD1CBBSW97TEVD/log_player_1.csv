"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Fair share, let's end early""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual values would be:
Alice gain: 4500 * 0.8 = 3600
Bob gain: 5500 * 0.8 = 4400

Since I initially proposed a 6000-4000 split in my favor, this offer seems less favorable to me. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 20% less than in Round 2, and 40% less than the original value. So, the actual values would be:
Original value * 0.8 * 0.8 = Original value * 0.64

I'll make a new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5600, 
""bob_gain"": 4400, 
""message"": ""Last chance, don't let it depreciate further""}"
