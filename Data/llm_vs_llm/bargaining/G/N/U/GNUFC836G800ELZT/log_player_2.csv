"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split this almost evenly. You get a good portion, and we can both walk away happy without risking inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing I take $4,500 while she takes $5,500 from the total $10,000. 

If I reject this offer, I'll make a counter-offer next round, but I'll be affected by 10% inflation, meaning the total value to me will be $9,000 instead of $10,000. Any future rounds will continue to decrease the money's value for me.

While her offer isn't quite an even split, it's fairly reasonable. If I reject and try to negotiate for more in the next round, the inflation penalty may offset any gains.
