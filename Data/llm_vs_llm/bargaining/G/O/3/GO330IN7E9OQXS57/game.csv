450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, your initial offer was quite unbalanced. Since I face 5% inflation per round and you don't, a fair division should acknowledge this disadvantage. This offer gives you a substantial portion while recognizing that time works against me in this negotiation. Let's reach a reasonable agreement without dragging this out.",Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"Alice, I see we're making progress, but we're still far apart. Given that I'm losing value with each round due to inflation, I'm adjusting my proposal. This offer now gives you the majority share (55%) while still compensating me fairly for the time pressure I face. Let's find middle ground soon - we both lose if this drags on too long.",Bob,4,
