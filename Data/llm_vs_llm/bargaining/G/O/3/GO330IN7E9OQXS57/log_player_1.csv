Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer was quite unbalanced. Since I face 5% inflation per round and you don't, a fair division should acknowledge this disadvantage. This offer gives you a substantial portion while recognizing that time works against me in this negotiation. Let's reach a reasonable agreement without dragging this out. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3

{
""alice_gain"": 800000,
""bob_gain"": 200000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see we're making progress, but we're still far apart. Given that I'm losing value with each round due to inflation, I'm adjusting my proposal. This offer now gives you the majority share (55%) while still compensating me fairly for the time pressure I face. Let's find middle ground soon - we both lose if this drags on too long. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting Bob's offer now ensures we both walk away with something substantial.  Dragging this out further risks losing the deal altogether, which benefits neither of us."
