"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 47.37 
# Alice gain: 52.63 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer gives me $47.37 while she gets $52.63. This is reasonably close to a 50-50 split, but I could potentially get more by making a counter-offer. However, I need to consider that the total amount will decrease by 10% if we move to the next round, meaning we'd only have $90 to split.

After considering the inflation penalty, I think this is a fair first offer. If I reject, we lose $10 in total value, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in subsequent rounds.
