"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a split that accounts for the higher inflation penalty I face (10% vs Bob's 5%). Since any delay hurts me more than Bob, I should offer a reasonable split that Bob would likely accept immediately.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because:
1. It's a fair division that gives me a slight advantage
2. If Bob rejects, in the next round the total value will be worth less for both of us
3. The split is not so extreme that it would provoke Bob to reject out of principle"
