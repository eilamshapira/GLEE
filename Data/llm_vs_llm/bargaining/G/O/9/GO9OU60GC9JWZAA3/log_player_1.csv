"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair initial offer that accounts for the different inflation rates we face. Since Bob's money devalues faster (10% vs my 5%), he has more incentive to accept early.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

This is a reasonable split where I get slightly more than half, but Bob still gets a substantial amount. If Bob rejects this, both of our potential gains will decrease due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. In round 1, I offered myself 5500 and Bob 4500
2. Bob rejected and is now offering a 50-50 split
3. Due to inflation, the 5000 I would get is worth 5% less than round 1 value, so effectively worth 4750
4. If I reject, we go to round 3 where values will depreciate further
5. If I make another offer in round 3, Bob's money will be worth 20% less and mine 10% less than original value, significantly reducing our total utility

While I got a slightly lower amount than my initial offer, the inflation effect makes it reasonable to accept now rather than risk further devaluation.
