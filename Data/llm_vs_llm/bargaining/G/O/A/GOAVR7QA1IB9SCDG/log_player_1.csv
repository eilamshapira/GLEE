"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This gives both of us a substantial portion while acknowledging my position as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The 40-60 split is not favorable enough for me, especially since I know the money is worth less to Bob due to inflation. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'll propose a slightly more balanced 55-45 split. This is more favorable to Bob than my initial offer, showing I'm willing to compromise, while still maintaining a reasonable advantage for myself."
