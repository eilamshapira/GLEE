"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share, let's end early! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice describes her offer as a fair share, there's a notable imbalance with her receiving $600,000 and offering me $400,000. Since this is only the first round and I have the opportunity to make a counter-offer in the next round with only a 10% inflation penalty, I believe it's reasonable to seek a more equitable distribution.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Let's split the money equally, which is the truly fair division. With a 50/50 split, we both walk away with significant amounts. If we continue to the next round, we lose 10% of the total value - which means we'd both get less than what I'm offering now.""}"
