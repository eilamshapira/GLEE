"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose to split the money 60-40, giving me $600,000 and Bob $400,000. This is a fair offer that gives me a good portion while still being reasonable enough for Bob to accept, considering that rejecting would lead to inflation reducing the total value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer. While I understand Bob wants a larger share, $400,000 for me (which is now worth only $380,000 due to 5% inflation) is too low compared to my initial fair offer. Since Bob's money is worth 20% less this round, they seem to be more affected by inflation than I am. I'll make a new proposal in the next round, where I can hopefully find a better compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose a 55-45 split, which is more favorable to Bob than my first offer. Here's my reasoning:
1. My 550,000 is now worth 522,500 due to 5% inflation
2. Bob's portion appears to be more heavily affected by inflation, so offering them a larger share than my first proposal (450,000 vs 400,000) might make them more likely to accept
3. This is still better for me than accepting Bob's previous offer of 400,000
4. If Bob rejects again, the money will continue to lose value for both of us, so there's incentive to reach an agreement now"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer because:
1. My $300,000 would only be worth around $257,220 after the 14.26% inflation
2. Bob's $700,000 is heavily devalued (worth only about $358,400 after their 48.8% inflation)
3. This suggests Bob is being hit much harder by inflation than I am (48.8% vs 14.26%)
4. Since Bob's money is losing value much faster than mine, I have leverage to negotiate a better deal in the next round
5. Even with continued inflation, I should be able to secure a better outcome than $257,220 in effective value"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}

I'm adjusting my offer based on the inflation dynamics:
1. Bob's money is devaluing much faster than mine (48.8% vs 14.26% in last round)
2. This means Bob has more incentive to reach a deal quickly
3. My $650,000 will still be worth around $557,310 after my inflation
4. Bob's $350,000, even with their higher inflation rate, should still be worth more than if we continue to later rounds
5. Given the asymmetric inflation rates, this split actually represents a more balanced outcome in terms of real value than it appears nominally

Since Bob is losing value much faster than I am, they should recognize that accepting this offer now is better than continuing to negotiate while their share loses nearly half its value each time."
