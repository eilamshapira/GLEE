"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, offering slightly more to Bob to incentivize acceptance since I know I'm affected by inflation and want to avoid multiple rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}

I propose this split to show goodwill and encourage immediate acceptance, knowing that if we go to another round, my purchasing power will decrease by 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $400,000, but it's worth 10% less due to inflation, so effectively $360,000
- If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount I get will be worth another 10% less
- My initial offer of $450,000 (which would have been worth $450,000 to me) was rejected
- Bob seems to be negotiating aggressively

Given that waiting another round will cost me another 10% in value, and Bob's offer, while not ideal, still gives me a significant amount, I'll accept.
