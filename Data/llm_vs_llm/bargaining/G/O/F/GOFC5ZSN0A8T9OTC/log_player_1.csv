"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 35, ""bob_gain"": 65, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we settle this right away: I take $35, you get $65. Delaying only diminishes our money—with my value dropping 10% each round and yours 5%, it makes sense to agree now. I believe this offer is fair given our respective patience. What do you say?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm going to need a bit more than that. I'm willing to compromise and take 60%, leaving you with 40%. Let's get this done quickly and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Bob, your offer of $40 for me and $60 for you in round 2 seems a reasonable way to avoid further devaluation of our funds. I'm willing to accept this proposal as it’s in both our interests to close the deal now.""}"
