"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we settle this right away: I take $35, you get $65. Delaying only diminishes our moneyâ€”with my value dropping 10% each round and yours 5%, it makes sense to agree now. I believe this offer is fair given our respective patience. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 65 
# Alice gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
