"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since you face 20% devaluation per round and I don't, this 60-40 split is actually better for you than getting 50% in a later round. If you reject, your next round's money will be worth 20% less. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less each round, and this is the third round, the money I gain is now worth 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 of its original value.

To account for this devaluation, I'll make a new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 30, 
""bob_gain"": 70, 
""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to accept a lower share. Let's end the game before further devaluation.""}"
