"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance. However, I know that:
1. If I reject, I can make the next offer
2. Alice faces a 20% devaluation per round while I face no devaluation
3. This gives me negotiating leverage, as any delay hurts Alice more than me

Given these factors, I can likely get a better deal by rejecting this offer and proposing a split more in my favor in the next round. Alice would be more likely to accept it since her money would be worth less if she rejects.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Given that Alice faces 20% devaluation per round while I don't, I can propose a split more in my favor. After this round, if Alice rejects, her share would be worth another 20% less in the next round, while mine maintains full value. I'll propose a 60-40 split with a logical explanation.

{""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Since you face 20% devaluation per round and I don't, this 60-40 split is actually better for you than getting 50% in a later round. If you reject, your next round's money will be worth 20% less.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to accept a lower share. Let's end the game before further devaluation. 
# Bob gain: 70 
# Alice gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me 70% of the money, which is significantly better than my previous proposal of 60%
2. The inflation has already reduced Alice's purchasing power by 36%
3. If I reject, we go to another round where:
   - I could propose an even higher split in my favor
   - But Alice's money would devalue another 20%
   - There's a risk Alice might reject again, leading to further rounds

Given that this is already a very favorable offer for me (70%), and considering that pursuing an even better deal might lead to unnecessary rounds with risk of worse outcomes, I should accept this offer.
