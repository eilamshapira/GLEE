"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Alice is offering me $400,000 out of $1,000,000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 10% inflation, the money will be worth less to me next round
4. $400,000 now vs ($1,000,000 * 0.9) = $900,000 to divide next round
5. Even if I get a better percentage next round, the absolute value might be lower

I think $400,000 is a reasonable offer, considering:
- It's 40% of the total
- The inflation penalty makes waiting risky
- A bird in hand is worth two in the bush
