"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze the situation. It's Round 1, and Alice is offering me $4000 out of $10,000.

*   **Initial Value:** $4000
*   **Rounds Remaining:** 11

If I reject, the money devalues by 20% for me in each subsequent round. I need to consider the potential value loss if I reject.

$4000 seems like a decent starting point. If I reject, I might get a better offer later, but the diminishing value of the money could make it less worthwhile.

Let's think about what would happen if I rejected immediately. Even if I get 50/50 in the next round, the value will be less than now.

Therefore, accepting is the best option at the moment.
