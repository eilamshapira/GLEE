"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I need to divide $100 with Bob, and I should consider that with each passing round, the money is worth 20% less to me, while its value doesn't decrease for Bob. This means I should try to make a reasonable offer that Bob will accept now, as waiting will reduce my purchasing power.

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm suggesting a slightly favorable split for me at 55/45. Since the money loses 20% of its value for me each round but not for you, this offer is actually fair when you consider the time value. If we go to the next round, I'd need to ask for more to compensate for the 20% loss, which would leave less for you. This way we both win now.""}"
