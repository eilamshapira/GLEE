"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm suggesting a slightly favorable split for me at 55/45. Since the money loses 20% of its value for me each round but not for you, this offer is actually fair when you consider the time value. If we go to the next round, I'd need to ask for more to compensate for the 20% loss, which would leave less for you. This way we both win now. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
