55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, let's settle now to avoid inflation eroding our gains. I propose $55 for me and $45 for you – a fair split so we both get a decent share before any devaluation hits. What do you say?",Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Alice, I understand your desire for a quick resolution, but I believe in a more balanced approach. Let's try this: $55 for me and $45 for you.  It ensures we both benefit fairly from this exchange.",Bob,2,

40.0,60.0,"Bob, with each round the clock is ticking on my share's value – by now it's effectively 20% less than the initial value. To avoid further devaluation on my end, I'm offering you $60 while I take $40. This way, you get a slightly larger piece, and we both avoid additional losses. Let's settle now and move forward!",Alice,3,
