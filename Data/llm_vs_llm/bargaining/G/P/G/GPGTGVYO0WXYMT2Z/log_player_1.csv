"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's settle now to avoid inflation eroding our gains. I propose $55 for me and $45 for you – a fair split so we both get a decent share before any devaluation hits. What do you say?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire for a quick resolution, but I believe in a more balanced approach. Let's try this: $55 for me and $45 for you.  It ensures we both benefit fairly from this exchange. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""Bob, with each round the clock is ticking on my share's value – by now it's effectively 20% less than the initial value. To avoid further devaluation on my end, I'm offering you $60 while I take $40. This way, you get a slightly larger piece, and we both avoid additional losses. Let's settle now and move forward!""}"
