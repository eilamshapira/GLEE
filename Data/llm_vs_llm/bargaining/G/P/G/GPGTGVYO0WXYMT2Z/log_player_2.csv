"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's settle now to avoid inflation eroding our gains. I propose $55 for me and $45 for you – a fair split so we both get a decent share before any devaluation hits. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, with each round the clock is ticking on my share's value – by now it's effectively 20% less than the initial value. To avoid further devaluation on my end, I'm offering you $60 while I take $40. This way, you get a slightly larger piece, and we both avoid additional losses. Let's settle now and move forward! 
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
