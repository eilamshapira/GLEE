"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first move. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement within 12 rounds. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. First offer: $400,000 for me, $600,000 for Alice
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 20% inflation, my next round value would be worth less
4. $400,000 now > $400,000 * 0.8 = $320,000 next round

While I could try to negotiate for a better split, the 20% inflation penalty is significant. A 60-40 split is not unreasonable for a first offer, and trying to get a better deal might leave me worse off due to inflation.

Given the inflation risk and that this is a fairly reasonable first offer, I should accept.
