"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, considering inflation. In Round 1, I offered $600,000 for myself. Now, even though I'm being offered $450,000, the value of my money is reduced by 20%. Therefore, I will calculate the equivalent value of Bob's offer: $450,000 * 0.8 = $360,000

My best offer of the $600,000 I wanted has diminished in value to $480,000

Therefore I will reject the offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, considering the inflation, I need to make a better offer for myself. The money's value to me has decreased even more.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's calculate the real value of my potential gains.

*   **Round 1 Value (Alice's perspective):** $1,000,000
*   **Round 4 Inflation:** 48.8% less

Therefore, my current value: $1,000,000 \* (1 - 0.488) = $512,000

Bob's offer: Alice gains $500,000. Considering inflation, this $500,000 is worth more than my initial offer to Bob
