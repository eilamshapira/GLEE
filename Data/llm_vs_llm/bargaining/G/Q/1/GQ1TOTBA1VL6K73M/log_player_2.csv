"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","While a 50-50 split seems fair on the surface, I need to consider the inflation factor. The money doesn't lose value for me over rounds, but it does for Alice at 5% per round. This gives me a strategic advantage if we continue to later rounds.

If I reject now, I can make a counter-offer that accounts for this asymmetry. Since Alice will face depreciation in future rounds, she has more incentive to reach an agreement sooner.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer that acknowledges the inflation factor while still being reasonable enough that Alice should accept it.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering you $5,500 and Alice $4,500. This slight adjustment from the 50-50 split reflects the fact that waiting becomes more costly for Alice due to the 5% inflation she faces each round. It's in her interest to accept a reasonable offer now rather than potentially facing a less valuable outcome in later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5250 
# Alice gain: 4750 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has improved her offer, giving me $5,250 which is better than the initial 50-50 split, though not as good as my proposal of $5,500. She's acknowledging the inflation factor and moving in my direction.

Given that:
1. The money's value doesn't decrease for me over time
2. Alice is already facing nearly 10% inflation on her share
3. We have 9 more rounds possible, which would significantly devalue Alice's position
4. The offer is reasonable and moving toward my advantage

I'll accept this offer and conclude the negotiation rather than risk a prolonged negotiation that might become less collaborative.
