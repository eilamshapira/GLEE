"Round 1
Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, the money is now worth 10% less for me, so the total amount I'm considering is $100 * 0.9 = $90. I'll make an offer that gives me a bit more than half of this reduced amount.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Alice's offer, I'll get $45, but its value is 19% less than the original, so I'll calculate the ""real"" value as $45 / 0.81 â‰ˆ $55.56 (in terms of the original value).

On the other hand, if I reject this offer, the money will be worth even less for me in the next round. Given that Alice's offer gives me a significant amount, and considering the decreasing value of the money, I think it's a good idea to accept.
