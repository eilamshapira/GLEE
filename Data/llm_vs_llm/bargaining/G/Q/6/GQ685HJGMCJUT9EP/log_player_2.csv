Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is hitting us hard. This offer is still better for you than what you offered last round considering I have the inflation penalty. Let's end this and get some money! 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is trying to use the threat of inflation to pressure me into a bad deal.  While her offer is slightly better than her first offer, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. I'm willing to gamble that she's feeling the pressure of inflation as much as I am."
