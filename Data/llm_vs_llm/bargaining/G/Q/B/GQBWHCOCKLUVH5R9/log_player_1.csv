"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my first offer to divide the $10,000. Given that we're facing inflation of 20% per round for me, I should aim for a fair division that takes this into account.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose an equal split of $5,000 each. This is a fair division that gives us both the same amount, and allows us to finish the negotiation quickly before inflation reduces the value for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I notice that Bob is experiencing much less inflation (only 5% per round) compared to my 20% per round. This means delaying agreement hurts me more than it hurts Bob, which explains his aggressive first offer. Still, I need to find a reasonable middle ground.

{""alice_gain"": 4500,
""bob_gain"": 5500}

I'm proposing a slightly adjusted split that acknowledges the inflation difference between us. This gives Bob more than half but is more balanced than his previous offer. Since the inflation is affecting me more severely, it's better for both of us to reach an agreement quickly rather than continue negotiating."
