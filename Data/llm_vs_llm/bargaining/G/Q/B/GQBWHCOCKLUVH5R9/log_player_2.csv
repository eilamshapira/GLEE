Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This offer is now barely better for me than Alice's original offer in round 1, considering the inflation. While I'd prefer to get more, it's too risky to reject and hope for a better offer in later rounds as the inflation will continue to erode the value."
