"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly down the middle, Bob. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing an even 50-50 split, which gives me $5,000. 

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, I'll be dealing with 10% inflation, meaning the total value to me will only be $9,000. Even if I could get all of that (which is unlikely), I'd only receive $9,000, which is worse than taking $5,000 now.

A 50-50 split is fair, and accepting now maximizes my value given the inflation penalty.
