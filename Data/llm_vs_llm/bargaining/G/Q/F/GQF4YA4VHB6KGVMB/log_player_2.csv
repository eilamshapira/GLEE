"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","While the 50-50 split is fair on its face, I need to consider the inflation effect. If I reject this offer, I'll make a counteroffer next round, but the total amount will be worth 5% less to me. That means the $10,000 would be worth $9,500 to me in the next round. Even if I were to get all $10,000 in the next round (which is unlikely Alice would accept), it would be worth less than getting $5,000 now.
