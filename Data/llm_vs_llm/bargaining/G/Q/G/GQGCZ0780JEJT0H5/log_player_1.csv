"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair but slightly advantageous split for myself, considering I'm making the first move and there's inflation risk if negotiations extend.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

My reasoning: This is a reasonable first offer giving me a slight advantage while still being fair enough that Bob might accept. If Bob rejects, the next round's money will be worth 10% less to me, so there's incentive to reach an agreement quickly."
