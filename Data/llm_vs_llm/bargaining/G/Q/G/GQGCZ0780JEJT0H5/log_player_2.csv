"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer gives me $4,500 out of the $10,000, which is 45% of the total. If I reject and go to the next round, I'll face 5% inflation, meaning any amount I get will be worth less to me.

Let me think about this: If I make a counter-offer in round 2, the maximum value I could get would be $10,000 Ã— 0.95 = $9,500 in effective value. So even if I demanded most of that, I'm already at a disadvantage compared to taking $4,500 now.

While Alice's offer gives her more than me, it's not extremely unfair, and the inflation penalty makes waiting risky for me.
