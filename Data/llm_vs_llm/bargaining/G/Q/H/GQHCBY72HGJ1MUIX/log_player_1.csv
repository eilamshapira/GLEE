"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less each round, the initial $1,000,000 is now worth $950,000.

I analyze the offer:

*   **My gain:** $500,000 (before inflation, now worth less)
*   **Bob's gain:** $500,000 (before inflation, now worth less)

Considering I can propose in the next round, I can try to get more.

Therefore, I will **reject** this offer.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 3. Remember that the money is now worth less than in the previous rounds due to inflation. Let's assume the starting $1,000,000 is still the base.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 620000, ""bob_gain"": 380000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze Bob's offer in Round 4.

*   **Alice Gain:** $450,000.
*   **Bob Gain:** $550,000.
*   **Inflation Impact:** The money is worth 14.26% less than in Round 1.

To determine if I should accept, I need to consider the expected value of the next round. It's complex to calculate the exact impact of inflation as it compounds over each round. However, the general trend is that money becomes less and less valuable over time.

Given that the offer is relatively even, and that rejecting means potentially getting less in the future due to inflation, I should accept the offer.

```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
