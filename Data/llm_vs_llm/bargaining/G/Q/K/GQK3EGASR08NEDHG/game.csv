600000.0,400000.0,"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm proposing a more balanced split. With $600000 for you and $400000 for me, we both get substantial amounts. Remember that both of us face inflation penalties with each round (20% for me, 5% for you), so it's in our mutual interest to reach an agreement quickly. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the time pressure.",Bob,2,
