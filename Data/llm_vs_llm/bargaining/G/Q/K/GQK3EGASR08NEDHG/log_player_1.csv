"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm proposing a more balanced split. With $600000 for you and $400000 for me, we both get substantial amounts. Remember that both of us face inflation penalties with each round (20% for me, 5% for you), so it's in our mutual interest to reach an agreement quickly. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the time pressure. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
