"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair proposal. I take 800k, and you take 200k. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $200,000 while she gets $800,000, which is an 80-20 split in her favor. 

I should keep in mind that with each round, my money loses 20% of its value while Alice's only loses 5%. This means delaying puts me at a significant disadvantage.

Let me calculate: If I reject now, the next round I'd need to propose something better than $200,000, but that amount would already be worth only $160,000 to me due to the 20% inflation on my side.

While I don't think this is an optimal split given the total amount, the inflation penalty makes immediate resolution attractive.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I need to make a strategic counteroffer that considers the inflation penalties we both face. Since my money loses value faster (20% per round) than Alice's (5% per round), I should propose a reasonable split that Alice would accept now.

{""bob_gain"": 400000,
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm proposing a more balanced split. With $600,000 for you and $400,000 for me, we both get substantial amounts. Remember that both of us face inflation penalties with each round (20% for me, 5% for you), so it's in our mutual interest to reach an agreement quickly. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the time pressure.""}"
