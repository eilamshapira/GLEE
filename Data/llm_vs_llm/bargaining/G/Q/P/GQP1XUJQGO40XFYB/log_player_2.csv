"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether Alice's offer of $2500 for me and $7500 for her is worth accepting, given that delaying would reduce the value of money for me by 20% per round.

If I reject and propose in round 2, the total would be worth only 8000 to me due to 20% inflation. Even if I could get a 50-50 split in round 2 (which isn't guaranteed), I'd get 4000, which is still better than the current 2500. However, Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to even more inflation.

Given the significant imbalance in Alice's initial proposal and the fact that I still have room to negotiate even with inflation, I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll offer a more balanced split while acknowledging the inflation factor that affects me. Since we're in round 2, I'm already facing 20% inflation on my end, but I need a fair division.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an equal 50-50 split, which I believe is fair to both of us. While I understand we're in round 2 and inflation affects me, a balanced division respects both our interests in this negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 6667 
# Alice gain: 3333 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer considering the inflation affecting me.

In round 3, I face 36% inflation, meaning each dollar is worth only 64% of its original value to me. With Alice's offer of $6667 for me, the effective value to me is:
$6667 Ã— 0.64 = $4267

This is significantly better than her first offer ($2500), and better than what I'd effectively get if I proposed a 50-50 split in round 4 after another round of inflation.

Since Alice has moved substantially in my favor and the inflation penalty makes further negotiation increasingly costly for me, I'll accept this offer.
