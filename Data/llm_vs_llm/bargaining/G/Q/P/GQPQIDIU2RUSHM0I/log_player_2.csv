"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. 

Alice is offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance. However, I need to account for the different inflation rates we face:
- My inflation rate is 10% per round
- Alice's inflation rate is 5% per round

If I reject and make my own offer in round 2, the total value will already be reduced. My $50 would be worth $45 after one round of inflation, while Alice's $50 would be worth $47.50.

Since this is a fair initial offer and inflation will hurt both of us (especially me) with each passing round, accepting this even split now is the rational choice.
