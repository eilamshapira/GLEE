Although I would prefer a larger share, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly. Delaying further significantly erodes the value of any potential winnings for both of us.
* **Uncertainty:** I don't know how inflation is affecting Bob's perception of the deal. He might be more resistant to accepting offers as time goes on if he's experiencing less inflation.
* **Fairness:** While not ideal, a 50/50 split is objectively fair. Accepting shows a willingness to compromise and avoids the risk of walking away with nothing."
