Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, since we couldn't agree on 50/50 and your last offer was too skewed, how about we try a 55/45 split in my favor this time? Let's find a middle ground before the value drops too much. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

I need to push Alice towards a more favorable split before the inflation eats away at the potential gains too much."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, given the increasing impact of inflation, especially on your side, I propose a 60/40 split in my favor this time. It's a compromise from my last offer, considering the urgency to settle before the value diminishes further. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is not ideal, but the inflation is hurting me badly.  It's better to take a smaller share than risk getting nothing at all."
