"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a slightly favorable split for me, but still fair enough that Bob might accept rather than risk inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose taking $5,500 for myself and giving $4,500 to Bob. This way, we both get a substantial amount, and Bob might prefer taking this deal now rather than letting inflation eat into the total value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept now, I'll get $4,500, but due to 10% inflation, it's actually worth $4,050 to me
2. If I reject, I can make another offer, but any amount I get will be worth 20% less in the next round
3. Bob seems to be trying to mirror my first offer, but reversed
4. Since inflation is affecting my gains but not Bob's, waiting longer puts me at a disadvantage

Given these factors, this offer isn't great but waiting will likely make things worse for me. I should accept now before inflation reduces my potential gains further.
