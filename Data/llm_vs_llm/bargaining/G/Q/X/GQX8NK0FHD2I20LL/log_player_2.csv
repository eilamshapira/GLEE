"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me 4500$ out of 10000$
2. It's a fairly balanced split (45% vs 55%)
3. It's the first round, so I have more chances to negotiate
4. The money doesn't lose value for me over rounds
5. I could potentially get a better deal, and I don't risk much by rejecting

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a slightly more balanced offer, but still favorable to me since I know the money doesn't lose value for me:

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split because:
1. It's still a reasonable division (55/45)
2. It's the mirror image of Alice's first offer
3. If Alice rejects, she risks further rounds where the money might be worth less to her
4. If Alice accepts, we both get a substantial amount"
