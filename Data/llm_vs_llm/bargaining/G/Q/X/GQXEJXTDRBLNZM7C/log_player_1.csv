"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that I take $60 and you take $40. This seems like a fair starting point for me, considering I initiated the proposal. Let me know what you think!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose that I receive $52.63 and you receive $47.37. If we delay further, the total value drops even more. I believe this split reflects our future bargaining positions, ensuring that you get as much as you would expect by waiting. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 47.37 
# Bob gain: 52.63 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
