"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a fair 60-40 split. This is reasonable considering the inflation penalties we both face, and you'll get a solid $4000 right now rather than a depreciated amount later. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to think through this offer carefully given our different inflation penalties.

If I reject, I'll make a counteroffer next round, but my money will be worth 20% less, while Alice's will only depreciate by 5%. 

Looking at Alice's offer of $4000 to me and $6000 to her:
- If I accept now, I get $4000
- If I reject and propose next round, the total value is reduced, and Alice might reject my counteroffer, leading to further depreciation

Given the significant difference in our inflation penalties (20% vs 5%), Alice has a stronger position in later rounds. The 60-40 split isn't equal, but considering the asymmetric inflation penalties, it's not unreasonable.
