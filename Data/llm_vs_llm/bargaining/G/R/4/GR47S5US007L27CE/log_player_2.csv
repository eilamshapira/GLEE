"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair starting point, considering I'm the one making the first offer.  Let's see what you think. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll need to consider this offer carefully. While I appreciate Alice making the first proposal, the distribution seems quite uneven at $1,000 for me and $9,000 for Alice.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I think we can find a more balanced division, and I'll make a counter-proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for starting the negotiation. I'm proposing an even 50-50 split which I believe is fair for both of us. This way we both benefit equally from the money.""}"
