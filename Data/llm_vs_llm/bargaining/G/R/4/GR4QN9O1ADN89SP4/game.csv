450000.0,550000.0,"Given that you face 10% depreciation per round while I face 5%, this split is actually favorable for both of us if we agree now. If we continue to the next round, you'll lose more value than I will. Let's make a deal now and both walk away with more value.",Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I understand your point about depreciation, but I am also the one making the proposals now. My depreciation is a factor, but so is your desire to end the game with a reasonable amount. Let's meet in the middle. 55/45 split. Accept this time!",Alice,3,
