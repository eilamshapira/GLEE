"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given that you face 10% depreciation per round while I face 5%, this split is actually favorable for both of us if we agree now. If we continue to the next round, you'll lose more value than I will. Let's make a deal now and both walk away with more value. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
