"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's agree on this generous offer from my side, a 60/40 split for me. It's fair considering the game dynamics and inflation! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $400,000 for me, $600,000 for Alice

2. If I reject:
- Next round I can make an offer
- Money will be worth 5% less for me (I'll feel the loss)
- Money will be worth 10% less for Alice (she'll feel it more)
- This gives me negotiating leverage in the next round

3. Alice's starting position of 60/40 isn't particularly generous, especially since:
- She's losing value faster than I am (10% vs 5%)
- I'll have the power to make the next offer
- She'll be more motivated to accept my next offer due to her higher inflation rate

4. Decision:
I should reject this and make a counter-offer in the next round where I can propose a more favorable split, knowing Alice will be under more pressure to accept due to her higher depreciation rate.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a strategic offer:

Given that Alice faces 10% depreciation while I face 5%, I should propose a more favorable split for me, but not so extreme that she'll definitely reject it. If she rejects, she'll face more value loss than I will in the next round.

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Given that you face 10% depreciation per round while I face 5%, this split is actually favorable for both of us if we agree now. If we continue to the next round, you'll lose more value than I will. Let's make a deal now and both walk away with more value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point about depreciation, but I am also the one making the proposals now. My depreciation is a factor, but so is your desire to end the game with a reasonable amount. Let's meet in the middle. 55/45 split. Accept this time! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Current offer: $450,000 for me, but worth 9.75% less than initial value
- Real value for me: $450,000 * (1 - 0.0975) = $406,125

2. If I reject:
- Next round I can make an offer
- My depreciation will increase to about 15%
- Alice's depreciation will increase to about 29%
- The difference in our depreciation rates (14%) is getting larger

3. Alice's 55/45 split is more reasonable than her initial offer
- She's moved significantly from her initial 60/40 position
- She's offering me more despite having less valuable money herself
- The offer is fair considering the current round

4. Decision:
I should accept this offer because:
- The increasing depreciation rates make future negotiations more costly for both
- The split is reasonable
- The gap between our depreciation rates isn't worth the risk of another round
