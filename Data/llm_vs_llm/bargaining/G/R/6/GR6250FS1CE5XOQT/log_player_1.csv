"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to consider that inflation affects the value of future rounds, more significantly for me than for Bob. In the first round, I want to make a reasonable offer that Bob is likely to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose we split the $100 with $60 for me and $40 for Bob. This is a fair offer considering that if Bob rejects it, inflation will reduce the total value for both of us, but more severely for me. Since I'm affected more by delay, it makes sense for me to offer a generous portion to Bob to encourage immediate acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider the effects of inflation on my decision. At this point, the $40 I would receive is worth only 80% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $32 in round 1 value. Meanwhile, Bob's $60 is worth 95% of its original value to him, equivalent to $57 in round 1 value.

If I reject and we go to round 3, inflation will reduce my gains by another 20% (down to 64% of original value), while Bob's will only be reduced by another 5% (down to 90.25% of original value). This asymmetric inflation puts me at a disadvantage if the negotiation continues.

Given these considerations:
