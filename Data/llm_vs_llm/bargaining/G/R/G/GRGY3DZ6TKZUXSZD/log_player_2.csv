Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, how about a 475000 for me and 525000 for you? It's a bit more in your favor this time, Bob. Let's see if we can settle this round. 
# Bob gain: 525000 
# Alice gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While not ideal, accepting this offer makes the most sense given the circumstances. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The longer this goes on, the less that $1,000,000 is actually worth. Accepting now cuts my losses from inflation.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is getting closer to a more reasonable split. While her gain is slightly higher than what mine would be if we split it evenly in this round, it's not drastically different.
* **Uncertainty:** I don't know how inflation is affecting Alice. If it's impacting her less, she has less incentive to make a significantly better offer. 

It's better to take a slightly smaller piece now than risk getting even less later."
