"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50-50 split is more fair. Since we're both facing inflation (though possibly at different rates), an equal split respects both our interests. Let's settle this quickly and both walk away with a good deal. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
