"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split this fairly. I think this is a good start! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","While I appreciate the effort to start a negotiation, the offer seems imbalanced. Given that the money is worth 20% less for me each round, I should consider the time value, but a 40-60 split still feels too skewed in Alice's favor.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50-50 split is more fair. Since we're both facing inflation (though possibly at different rates), an equal split respects both our interests. Let's settle this quickly and both walk away with a good deal.""}"
