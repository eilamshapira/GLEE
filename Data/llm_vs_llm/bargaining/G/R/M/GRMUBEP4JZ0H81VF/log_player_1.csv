Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given that you face higher inflation (20%) than I do (5%), waiting costs you more. This 60-40 split reflects that reality while still giving you a significant portion. I suggest we agree now to maximize both our gains. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
