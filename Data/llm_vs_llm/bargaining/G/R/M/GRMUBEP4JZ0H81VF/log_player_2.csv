"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's keep it simple and fair by splitting the amount equally. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

1. The offer is a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance.
2. However, inflation affects Alice more severely (20% per round) than me (5% per round).
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round where:
   - My share would be worth 5% less
   - But Alice's share would be worth 20% less
4. This gives me negotiating leverage for a better split in the next round.

Given this analysis, I'll reject this offer to aim for a more favorable split.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since I rejected the 50-50 split, I should propose a split that accounts for our different inflation rates while still being reasonable enough for Alice to accept.

Given that Alice faces 20% inflation per round compared to my 5%, I'll propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which reflects this disadvantage while still giving Alice a substantial portion.

{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Given that you face higher inflation (20%) than I do (5%), waiting costs you more. This 60-40 split reflects that reality while still giving you a significant portion. I suggest we agree now to maximize both our gains.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your point. How about meeting in the middle with a 45-55 split? This acknowledges the inflation impact on us both while ensuring fairness. Letâ€™s settle this now! 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice has acknowledged the inflation difference and moved towards my position with a 55-45 split in my favor.
2. Current inflation impact:
   - My share is worth 9.75% less than round 1
   - Alice's share is worth 36% less than round 1
3. If I reject:
   - Next round my share would be worth about 15% less
   - Alice's share would be worth about 56% less
4. The offer is reasonable and the inflation cost of continuing negotiation is significant for both of us

Given that Alice has made a meaningful concession and further delay would significantly reduce the value for both of us, I'll accept this offer.
