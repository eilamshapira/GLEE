"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 79.17 
# Alice gain: 20.83 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if this offer is fair and whether I might get a better deal in the next round, taking into account the 5% inflation for me and 20% inflation for Alice.

Alice is offering me $79.17 and taking $20.83 for herself. This is actually quite favorable to me as I would get about 79% of the total amount.

If I reject and make a counter-offer, the total value decreases - for me by 5% and for Alice by 20%. This means Alice has a stronger incentive to agree early, and she's already offering me a generous portion.

Given the favorable split and the fact that I'll lose value if we continue to another round, I'll accept this offer.
