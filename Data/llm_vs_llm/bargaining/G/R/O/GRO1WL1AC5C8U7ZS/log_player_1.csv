"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split, but slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose that I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable split that gives both of us a substantial portion, with a small advantage to me as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept now:
   * I would get $45, but with 20% inflation = $36 effective value
   * Bob would get $55 with 5% inflation = $52.25 effective value

2. If I reject and make a new offer next round:
   * The money will be worth even less (40% less for me, 10% less for Bob)
   * Even if I propose a better split, Bob might reject again

Given that inflation is hitting me harder than Bob, and the offer isn't terrible (45-55 split), I should probably accept now before the money loses more value.
