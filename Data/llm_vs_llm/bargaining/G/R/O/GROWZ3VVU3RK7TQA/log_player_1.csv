"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, considering I'm making the first move and taking initiative in starting our negotiation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55-45 split in my favor, as I believe it's a more balanced and fair division considering we both have equal stakes in the negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
* If I accept now, I'll get $450,000 with 5% inflation, so effectively $427,500
* If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount I get will be worth 10% less than original value
* Bob's current offer is reasonably fair, and waiting another round would mean more value lost to inflation
* My best alternative (making a new offer) would likely face rejection and lead to even more value loss
