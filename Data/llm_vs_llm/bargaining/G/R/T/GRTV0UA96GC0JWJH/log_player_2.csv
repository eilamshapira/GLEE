"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. I'm being offered $400,000 out of $1,000,000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 20% inflation, any money I get next round will be worth 20% less to me
4. If I reject, my $400,000 would effectively become worth $320,000 next round

Since rejecting would mean losing significant value due to inflation, and $400,000 is a substantial amount (40% of the total), I'll accept this offer.
