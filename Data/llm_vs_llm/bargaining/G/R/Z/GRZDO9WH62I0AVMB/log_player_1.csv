"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","For the first round, I'll make a reasonable offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob with each passing round, I'll try to be somewhat generous to encourage Bob to accept.

Here's my offer:
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

This way, I get 55% of the money, and Bob gets 45%. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, the actual value I'd get from Bob's offer is:
600000 * 0.95 = 570000

And for Bob, the money he gains is worth 20% less, so the actual value he'd get is:
400000 * 0.80 = 320000

Considering this, Bob's offer seems quite generous towards me. I think I'll accept it to avoid further inflation and potential losses.
