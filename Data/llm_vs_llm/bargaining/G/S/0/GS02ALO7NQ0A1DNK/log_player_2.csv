"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, Bob.  A slight advantage for me seems fair since I'm taking the risk with inflation in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $450,000 for me, $550,000 for Alice
2. If I reject, in the next round:
   - I can make a counter-offer
   - But the money will be worth 5% less to me
   - $1,000,000 * 0.95 = $950,000 total value for me next round

While Alice's offer isn't perfectly equal, it's reasonably fair. If I reject:
- Best case: I might get more in the next round
- Risk: Further negotiations could lead to more losses due to inflation
- The 5% inflation would mean I need to get significantly more to make up for the loss in value

Given the substantial inflation penalty and the relatively fair initial offer, accepting is the better choice.
