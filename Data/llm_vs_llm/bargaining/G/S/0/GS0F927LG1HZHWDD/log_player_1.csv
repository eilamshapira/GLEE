"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 955000, ""bob_gain"": 45000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I’d like to settle immediately. Since every extra round devalues the pie—and given our different rates of devaluation (5% for me, 10% for you)—I propose that I take $955,000 and you get $45,000. If you reject, you’d soon be in the proposer’s seat but your money would be worth much less (around $45,000 in today’s value) once the discounting is taken into account. To avoid the further loss in value for both of us, I believe it’s optimal to agree now. Looking forward to your response!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand we have different inflation rates, but your initial offer was extremely unbalanced. I'm proposing an equal 50-50 split, which is $500000 each. This is fair and gives us both substantial value. If you reject this, we'll lose another round of value - your money will be worth 5% less and mine 10% less. Let's settle on this balanced division now rather than continue losing value through prolonged negotiations. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate the fairness of a 50-50 split, but I believe that since I'm next to propose—and knowing that my funds depreciate less quickly than yours—a better deal can be negotiated when I'm the proposer. I'm looking forward to making my offer in round 3.""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 100000, ""bob_gain"": 900000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for Round 3. If we reject an offer now, we both suffer further devaluation – in my case at a 5% per round rate (now at a multiplier of 0.9025) and in yours at 10% per round (now at 0.81). Thinking ahead, if you reject and become the proposer in Round 4, you could secure nearly the full pie, but your money would then be discounted further (to about 0.729 of its original value). To make you indifferent between waiting and accepting now, I’m offering you $900,000 nominal, which gives you an effective value of roughly 0.81×900,000 = $729,000 in today’s terms. I would receive $100,000 nominal—worth about 0.9025×100,000 = $90,250. This split matches the best alternative for you if you wait, so I hope you see the wisdom in settling now rather than losing additional value. I look forward to your response!""}"
