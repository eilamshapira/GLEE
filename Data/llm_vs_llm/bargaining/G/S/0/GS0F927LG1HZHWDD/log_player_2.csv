"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’d like to settle immediately. Since every extra round devalues the pie—and given our different rates of devaluation (5% for me, 10% for you)—I propose that I take $955000 and you get $45000. If you reject, you’d soon be in the proposer’s seat but your money would be worth much less (around $45000 in today’s value) once the discounting is taken into account. To avoid the further loss in value for both of us, I believe it’s optimal to agree now. Looking forward to your response! 
# Bob gain: 45000 
# Alice gain: 955000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's proposal. In round 1, she's offering me $45,000 out of $1,000,000, which is only 4.5% of the total.

If I reject, I'll make a proposal in round 2. At that point, the money will be worth 10% less to me, but I can propose a much more favorable split. Since money devalues faster for me than for Alice, there is indeed time pressure, but her current offer is extremely unbalanced.

Even with the devaluation, I could offer a much more equitable split in the next round that would benefit me significantly more than $45,000.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced division that accounts for our different inflation rates while still being fair.

""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand we have different inflation rates, but your initial offer was extremely unbalanced. I'm proposing an equal 50-50 split, which is $500,000 each. This is fair and gives us both substantial value. If you reject this, we'll lose another round of value - your money will be worth 5% less and mine 10% less. Let's settle on this balanced division now rather than continue losing value through prolonged negotiations.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for Round 3. If we reject an offer now, we both suffer further devaluation – in my case at a 5% per round rate (now at a multiplier of 0.9025) and in yours at 10% per round (now at 0.81). Thinking ahead, if you reject and become the proposer in Round 4, you could secure nearly the full pie, but your money would then be discounted further (to about 0.729 of its original value). To make you indifferent between waiting and accepting now, I’m offering you $900000 nominal, which gives you an effective value of roughly 0.81×900000 = $729000 in today’s terms. I would receive $100000 nominal—worth about 0.9025×100000 = $90250. This split matches the best alternative for you if you wait, so I hope you see the wisdom in settling now rather than losing additional value. I look forward to your response! 
# Bob gain: 900000 
# Alice gain: 100000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has significantly improved her offer, now giving me $900,000 out of the $1,000,000, which is 90% of the total.

She's right about the inflation impact. At this point (round 3):
- For me, money is worth 81% of its original value (19% less)
- For Alice, money is worth 90.25% of its original value (9.75% less)

With this offer, I would effectively get $900,000 × 0.81 = $729,000 in round 1 value terms.

If I reject and we go to round 4, money would be worth 72.9% of original value to me, and I'd need to propose something very favorable to get a better outcome than the current offer.

This is a surprisingly good offer that accounts for our different inflation rates and gives me the majority of the money.
