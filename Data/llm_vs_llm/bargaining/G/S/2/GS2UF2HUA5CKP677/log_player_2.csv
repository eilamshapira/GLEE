"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a counter-offer in the next round. Since Alice faces 10% inflation per round while I don't, I have leverage to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering that Alice faces 10% inflation per round while I don't. If she rejects this, her next round's money will be worth 10% less, giving her more incentive to accept a reasonable offer now."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a counter-offer in the next round. Since Alice's money continues to devalue by 10% each round while mine maintains its value, I have a stronger negotiating position. Her $900,000 is already worth less than it was in round 1, and this trend will continue."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}

I propose a 70-30 split in my favor. Alice needs to understand that with each passing round, her share becomes worth less due to the 10% inflation she faces. Her $300,000 now is worth more than a larger amount in future rounds. This is still better for her than continuing to negotiate while facing increasing inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a counter-offer in the next round. Alice's $800,000 is now worth only about $525,000 in round 1 value due to the compounding 10% inflation she faces. My position continues to strengthen as her money loses value while mine maintains its worth. It's in her best interest to agree to a more balanced split soon."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 750000, ""alice_gain"": 250000}

I propose a 75-25 split. Given that Alice's money has already lost over 34% of its value and will continue to depreciate by 10% each round, this offer of $250,000 now is worth more to her than a larger amount in future rounds. With 6 rounds left, her negotiating position will only get weaker due to inflation. This is a reasonable offer considering the circumstances."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll continue negotiating. Alice's $700,000 is now worth only about $372,000 in original value due to the 46.86% inflation she's experienced. With 5 rounds remaining and her money continuing to lose 10% value each round, while my money maintains its value, I can still negotiate for a better split. The inflation pressure on her side should encourage a more favorable agreement soon."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000}

I propose an 80-20 split. At this point, Alice's share is subject to nearly 50% inflation, and with each passing round, she loses another 10% of value. Her $200,000 now is worth more than a larger amount in later rounds due to the compounding inflation she faces. With only 4 rounds left and her money continuously devaluing, this offer provides her with more real value than waiting for future rounds. It's in her best interest to accept this offer now rather than face even greater value loss in subsequent rounds."
