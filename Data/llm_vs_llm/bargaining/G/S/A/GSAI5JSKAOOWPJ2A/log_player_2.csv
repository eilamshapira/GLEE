"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. 
- Alice is offering me $30 out of $100
- If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me
- So in the next round, $100 would only be worth $80 to me
- Making it harder to negotiate a better deal

While $30 is not a great split, rejecting might put me in a worse position since any future gains will be reduced by 20%. Getting $30 now is better than potentially getting $40 later when it's worth less.
