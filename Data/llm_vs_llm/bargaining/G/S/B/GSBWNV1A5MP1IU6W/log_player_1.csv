"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, considering inflation and the new offer:

My share is now worth 10% less, so the equivalent value is 500,000 * 0.9 = 450,000.

I will **reject** this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 3, considering the earlier rejection and the ongoing inflation:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, calculating the impact of inflation and assessing Bob's offer in Round 4:

*   **My inflation:** My share is now worth 27.1% less than in Round 1. This means my 550,000 would be worth approximately 550,000 * (1-0.271) = 400,950
*   **Bob's inflation:** Bob's share is worth 48.8% less than in Round 1. This means his 450,000 is worth approximately 450,000 * (1-0.488) = 230,400

I need to make a decision based on the current value. Given the diminishing returns and the possibility of getting nothing, I'm going to **accept** this offer, as my offer in round 3 was rejected.
