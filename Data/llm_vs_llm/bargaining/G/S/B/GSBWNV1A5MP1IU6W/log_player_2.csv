"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Alice's offer of $400,000 for me and $600,000 for her. This is a 40%-60% split in her favor.

Let me think about this strategically. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation. So the $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $800,000 to me in the next round.

If I accept now, I get $400,000. If I reject and propose a better split next round, even if I managed to get 50% ($500,000), that would only be worth $400,000 to me after the 20% inflation. Any delay risks further depreciation.

Given that we have 12 rounds potentially, and I don't know how inflation affects Alice, I should probably negotiate for a better deal, but the first offer isn't terrible considering the inflation penalty I face.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split while acknowledging the inflation pressure I'm facing.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split that's fair to both of us. Given that I face 20% inflation per round, it's in my interest to reach an agreement quickly, and I believe this even division represents a fair compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice has rejected my fair 50-50 split and is now offering me an even worse deal than before - $300,000 instead of the initial $400,000. I also have new information: Alice faces inflation too, but at a lower rate than I do (19% vs. my 36% so far).

If I reject this offer, in the next round the money will be worth even less to me. However, Alice's decreasing offer suggests she may be trying to exploit my higher inflation rate by dragging this out.

Let me reconsider the game theory here:
- If I accept, I get $300,000
- If I reject, the money will depreciate further for both of us, but more severely for me
- We have 9 more rounds maximum, and if we don't agree, we both get nothing

Since Alice faces inflation too (albeit less than me), there's still incentive for her to reach a deal. Her reduced offer signals she's willing to play hardball, but I still have negotiating power.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll adjust my offer based on what I've learned about our different inflation rates. Since Alice has less time pressure than I do, I need to make a more appealing offer while still protecting my interests.

{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000}

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split for Alice while still securing a reasonable amount for myself. Given that we both face inflation (though mine is higher at 36% vs your 19%), it makes sense to reach an agreement soon. This 45-55 split acknowledges your stronger position while still being fair enough to both parties. We're both better off agreeing now than continuing to let inflation diminish the total value."
