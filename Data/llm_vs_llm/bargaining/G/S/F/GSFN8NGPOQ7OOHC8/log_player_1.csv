"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I should make a fair offer to Bob in this first round, considering that if he rejects my offer, he'll get to make a proposal in the next round. Since I don't have any inflation effects, the money's value remains the same for me across rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an equal split of the $10,000, which is fair and gives both of us the same amount. This balanced approach should be acceptable to Bob."
