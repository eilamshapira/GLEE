"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make my initial offer to Bob. I want to be fair but also account for the different inflation rates we face.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm offering you $45, Bob. Since my inflation rate (10%) is higher than yours (5%), I'm suggesting I take a slightly larger portion now so we can both maximize our total value. Let's resolve this quickly to avoid inflation reducing our total money."
