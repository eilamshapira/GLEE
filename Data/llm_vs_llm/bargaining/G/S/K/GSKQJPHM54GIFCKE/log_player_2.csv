"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer gives me $40 out of the $100. If I reject and move to the next round, the total value decreases by 10% for me, meaning I'd be dividing $90 worth of value in the next round (from my perspective). 

Let me consider this. If I reject now, I get to make a proposal in the next round, but the total value is lower. $40 now is more than $45 (half of $90) in the next round. Also, there's no guarantee Alice would accept my counterproposal.

Given the inflation penalty, I think this is a reasonable offer.
