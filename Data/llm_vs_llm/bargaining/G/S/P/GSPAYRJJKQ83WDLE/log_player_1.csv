"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Split it evenly, no need to wait!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is affecting me, let's settle this quickly. I'm offering you $450000, which is still a substantial amount. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect on me (5% less) and Bob's generous offer, I'll calculate the actual value I'd get:

$450,000 * 0.95 = $427,500

It's a decent offer, but I think I can get a better deal. I'll reject it for now.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $450,000 for me and $550,000 for him, I'll try to make a more balanced offer. Considering the inflation effect, the total value of the money is decreasing, so I'll aim for a fair split.

{""alice_gain"": 520000, 
""bob_gain"": 480000, 
""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation hit you're taking""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a bigger hit from inflation, so I need a bit more. Let's settle this before we both lose too much value. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect on me (14.26% less) and Bob's offer, I'll calculate the actual value I'd get:

$400,000 * 0.8574 = $342,960

This offer seems quite low, especially since Bob is getting a larger share. I think I can get a better deal, so I'll reject it for now.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $400,000 for me and $600,000 for him, I'll try to make a more balanced offer. Considering the inflation effect, the total value of the money is decreasing rapidly for both of us, so I'll aim for a fair split.
