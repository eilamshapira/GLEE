700000.0,300000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose that out of the $1000000, I'll receive $700000 and you'll receive $300000. This offer is made in the spirit of avoiding any delay losses from inflation—let’s lock this in now rather than risk devaluation in later rounds. I believe this is a fair and efficient split for both of us.",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your opening offer. However, I believe a more equitable split is in order. Considering the potential for inflation to erode the value of our earnings over subsequent rounds, I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This ensures a fairer outcome for both of us while acknowledging the inherent risks of prolonged negotiations. Let's settle this swiftly and securely.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can both do better by further negotiating. Given that my share's value remains stable while your share continues to be affected by inflation in subsequent rounds, I prefer to proceed to the next round where I can present a counterproposal.",Alice,2,reject
322656.0,677344.0,"Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for round 3: I’ll take $322656 and you’ll get $677344. I’ve calculated this split by considering our respective bargaining positions and the fact that while my share isn’t affected by inflation, your share loses about 5% of its value each round. In effect, by accepting this offer now you receive an effective value that at least matches (if not exceeds) what you could secure in the next round. I believe this proposal is fair and optimal given the circumstances—let’s settle it now before further discounts bite!",Alice,3,

375000.0,625000.0,"Alice, it's clear we both want to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's be efficient.  I'm proposing a 62.5/37.5 split.  This acknowledges the time pressure from inflation while still offering you a significant share.  Let's avoid further delays and finalize the deal now.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, I appreciate your effort to expedite our agreement, but I must decline this offer. While I recognize the time pressure from inflation, my portion maintains full value while your share already faces a 14.26% discount. This imbalance means that your effective gain falls short of what you'd ideally aim for in the long run. I'm inclined to negotiate further to find a more balanced proposal that properly accounts for these differences. Let's continue the discussion.",Alice,4,reject
449000.0,551000.0,"Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for round 5: I propose that I receive $449000 and you receive $551000. I've calculated this split by equating the effective value you'd get from your share—given the current inflation discount of about 18.55% (i.e. a factor of 0.8145) in this round—to the immediate amount I receive, ensuring that you get roughly the same effective dollar value if you accept now or if you wait. Since any delay further will only worsen your nominal value due to inflation, this split is a fair offer that protects both our interests. I believe this is the optimal balance for both of us; let's settle this and avoid any further losses.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, time is ticking and we both lose with each passing round. I'm sticking to my guns on this one.  A 60/40 split is fair considering the circumstances. It provides a clear advantage for me while still offering you a substantial sum. Let's end this now and secure our shares.",Bob,6,
,,"Bob, I appreciate your effort to move things forward, but I'm not comfortable accepting a 60/40 split that gives me $400000. Even though your share is discounted by 22.62%, that amount still leaves a notable imbalance between our sides. Given that my portion retains its full value while yours is eroded by inflation, I believe I can craft a proposal in the next round that better reflects our respective positions. Let's keep negotiating to reach a fairer agreement.",Alice,6,reject
360000.0,640000.0,"Hi Bob, considering that in this round your money is worth roughly 73.3% of its nominal value due to inflation, I've recalculated a division that aims to protect your effective earnings while still recognizing the cost of delay. In this proposal, I receive $360000 (full value for me) and you receive $640000 nominally, which translates to an effective amount of about $640000 × 0.733 ≈ $469000. This effective figure is in line with what you stood to gain in your previous proposal before discount adjustments, and waiting further would only reduce your share further. I believe this is a fair and pragmatic solution for both of us. Let's finalize this deal now to avoid any additional erosion of value.",Alice,7,
