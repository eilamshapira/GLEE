"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a proposal for the division of $10,000. Given that the money loses 5% of its value for me with each passing round, it's in my interest to reach a fair agreement early. 

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose an equal split of $5,000 each. This is fair and allows us both to walk away with a significant amount rather than risking further rounds where the total value decreases for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I notice that Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation penalty that affects only me. Since the money loses 5% value for me each round, let me make a reasonable counter-offer.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}

I'm proposing $5,200 for me and $4,800 for Bob. This slightly higher amount for me helps offset the inflation penalty I'm facing, while still giving Bob a substantial portion. It's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon before further inflation erodes my share's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I see that Bob is continuing to push for more money as the rounds progress, taking advantage of the inflation penalty that affects only my share. Let me make a more strategic offer.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm proposing $5,500 for me and $4,500 for Bob. This adjustment helps compensate for the increasing inflation penalty I'm facing (which is now over 14% and will continue to grow). This is still a fair offer that gives Bob a substantial portion while acknowledging the disadvantage I face with each passing round. It would be in both our interests to reach an agreement now rather than continuing further rounds where we both risk getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4250 
# Bob gain: 5750 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I notice Bob is steadily reducing his offers to me while increasing his own share. Given the mounting inflation penalty that only affects me, I need to adjust my strategy.

{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200}

I'm proposing $5,800 for me and $4,200 for Bob. This adjustment is necessary because with each round, my actual gain decreases significantly due to the inflation penalty (now over 22% and growing). Taking into account this penalty, my effective gain would be much closer to an equal split. We're now in round 7 of 12, and if we reach round 12 without agreement, we both get nothing. It's increasingly in both our interests to reach a deal soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I see that Bob continues to decrease his offers to me with each round, taking full advantage of the inflation penalty that only affects my share. At this point, we're entering the final third of our negotiation window.

{""alice_gain"": 6200, ""bob_gain"": 3800}

I'm proposing $6,200 for me and $3,800 for Bob. With the inflation penalty now exceeding 30% and growing, this offer would actually give me an effective value closer to $4,300 (after the 30.17% reduction), which is still less than half of the original $10,000. This offer acknowledges the significant disadvantage I face due to inflation while still providing Bob with a substantial amount. We have only a few rounds left, and we both risk getting nothing if we can't reach an agreement, so it's in our mutual interest to find common ground now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3750 
# Bob gain: 6250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","We're now at round 11 of 12, which means this is the second-to-last opportunity to reach an agreement before we both get nothing. I need to be strategic while accounting for the severe inflation penalty I'm facing.

{""alice_gain"": 6400, ""bob_gain"": 3600}

I'm proposing $6,400 for me and $3,600 for Bob. With the inflation penalty now at nearly 37%, my effective gain would be approximately $4,033 (after the 36.98% reduction), which is less than Bob's $3,600 in actual value. If we don't reach an agreement in this round or the next, we both walk away with nothing. This offer provides Bob with a substantial amount while attempting to compensate for the significant inflation disadvantage I face. Let's try to find common ground now rather than risk both of us getting nothing."
