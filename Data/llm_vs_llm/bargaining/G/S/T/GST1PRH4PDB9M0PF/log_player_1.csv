"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split since it's the first round, offering slightly more to Bob to make it attractive for acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 480000, ""bob_gain"": 520000}

I propose to give Bob $520,000 and keep $480,000 for myself, which I think is a fair and generous initial offer that respects both parties."
