"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. This is a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
2. However, if I reject, I can make my own offer in the next round
3. But due to 20% inflation, if I reject:
   * The $5000 offered now would be worth the equivalent of $4000 in the next round
   * Even if I could get a better split next round, I'd need to get significantly more to make up for the inflation loss

Given the substantial inflation penalty and the fact that this is a fair split, accepting now is better than risking a worse outcome after inflation.
