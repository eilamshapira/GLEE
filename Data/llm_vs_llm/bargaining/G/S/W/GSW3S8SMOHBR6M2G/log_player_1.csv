"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, the $4000 offered to me is actually worth $4000 * 0.8 = $3200 to me.

Considering this, I don't think the offer is fair.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 20% less in the second round and another 20% less in this round, so it's worth 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 of the original value. The money Bob gains is worth 5% less in the second round and another 5% less in this round, so it's worth 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025 of the original value.

To make a fair offer, I'll take this into account.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 48.8% less, the $4500 offered to me is actually worth $4500 * (1 - 0.488) = $4500 * 0.512 = $2304 to me.

Considering this, I think the offer is not very favorable to me, but I also need to consider that the value of the money will continue to decrease if I reject it.
