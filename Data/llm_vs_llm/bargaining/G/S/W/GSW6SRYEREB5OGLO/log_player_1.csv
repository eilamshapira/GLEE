Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a fair split where I get $550,000 and you get $450,000. With 5% inflation each round, it's in both our interests to agree quickly. This offer gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging that inflation affects me more with each passing round.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I need to ensure my share is fair too. I propose I get $525000 and you get $475000. This way, we both get a fair share considering the inflation risk for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
