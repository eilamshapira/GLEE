Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a fair split where I get $550000 and you get $450000. With 5% inflation each round, it's in both our interests to agree quickly. This offer gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging that inflation affects me more with each passing round. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000
