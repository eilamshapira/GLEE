"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's do a 55/45 split. You'll still end up with a nice sum. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll calculate the actual value I'd get:

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I'll multiply my gain by 0.95:
450000 * 0.95 = 427500

This is the actual value I'd get if I accept the offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since this is Round 3, the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round (which was already 5% less than the original), so it's now worth 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025 of the original value. The money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the previous round (which was already 20% less than the original), so it's now worth 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 of the original value.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 650000, 
""bob_gain"": 350000, 
""message"": ""My turn again, let's make it 65/35""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet closer to the middle with a 52.5/47.5 split. It's a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","To calculate the actual value I'd get, I'll consider the inflation. The money I gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, which means it's worth 0.8574 of the original value (1 - 0.1426 = 0.8574). 

So, I'll multiply my gain by 0.8574:
475000 * 0.8574 = 406867.5

This is the actual value I'd get if I accept the offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since this is Round 5, the money I gain is worth 19.01% less than in the first round (calculated as 1 - (0.95^4)), so it's now worth 0.8099 of the original value. The money Bob gains is worth 59.2% less than in the first round (calculated as 1 - (0.8^4)), so it's now worth 0.4096 of the original value.

Here's my offer for Round 5:

{""alice_gain"": 700000, 
""bob_gain"": 300000, 
""message"": ""Time to get a better deal, 70/30 split""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly at 50/50. It's the fairest option at this point. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","To calculate the actual value I'd get, I'll consider the inflation. The money I gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round, which means it's worth 0.7738 of the original value (1 - 0.2262 = 0.7738). 

So, I'll multiply my gain by 0.7738:
500000 * 0.7738 = 386900

This is the actual value I'd get if I accept the offer.

Considering the significant decrease in value for Bob's gain, I think this is a relatively good offer.
