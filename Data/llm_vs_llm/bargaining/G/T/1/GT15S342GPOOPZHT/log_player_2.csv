"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly and avoid inflation losses 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer to split the $100 evenly is fair, giving us both $50. With inflation reducing the value by 5% each round, accepting now would be the most economical choice. If I reject and we go another round, the total value decreases, and we'd both likely end up with less.
