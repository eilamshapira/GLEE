"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer. She's proposing that I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000 out of the $10,000 total.

If I reject and we go to the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation. That means the $10,000 would effectively be worth only $8,000 to me in the next round. My maximum potential gain would then be $8,000 (if I propose keeping everything and Alice accepts).

The $4,000 Alice is offering me now is 40% of the total. If I reject, even if I propose a better split for myself in the next round, I'm already losing 20% to inflation.

I think it's better for me to accept this offer rather than risk further rounds with inflation reducing the value.
