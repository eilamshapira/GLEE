"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it evenly, fair for both 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

The offer is a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance. However, if I reject, I can make my own offer next round. But I need to consider that:

1. The money will be worth 5% less next round due to inflation (so $10,000 becomes $9,500 in value for me)
2. Alice would then have the power to reject my offer, leading to further rounds and more value loss

With a 50-50 split, I'd get $5,000 right now. If I reject and go to next round, I'd be working with money that's worth $9,500 to me. Even if I managed to get a better percentage in the next round, I might end up with less actual value due to the inflation effect.

The current offer is fair and avoiding inflation is important, so I'll accept.
