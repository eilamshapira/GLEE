"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it equally. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage and we can both walk away happy. Deal? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
