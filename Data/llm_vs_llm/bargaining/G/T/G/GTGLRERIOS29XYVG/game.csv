600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, to avoid the cost of waiting (since each additional round reduces my share by 10%), I'm proposing that we settle now: I'll receive $600000 and you'll receive $400000. I believe this is a fair and efficient split given the circumstances. Looking forward to your prompt acceptance!",Alice,1,
