"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to avoid the cost of waiting (since each additional round reduces my share by 10%), I'm proposing that we settle now: I'll receive $600000 and you'll receive $400000. I believe this is a fair and efficient split given the circumstances. Looking forward to your prompt acceptance! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer is $400,000 for me and $600,000 for Alice
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 20% less for me in the next round
3. If I reject and propose in the next round, my maximum potential gain would be $800,000 (after 20% inflation = $640,000)
4. Alice revealed that she faces 10% inflation, which is less than my 20%
5. Given the asymmetric inflation rates, Alice has a stronger negotiating position
6. $400,000 now is better than potentially getting less in future rounds due to inflation

While a 40/60 split isn't perfectly equal, given the inflation pressure I face and the risk of further negotiations, this is actually a reasonable offer.
