"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I think an even split is the fairest approach. We both walk away with the same amount. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice has proposed a 50-50 split, which is perfectly fair and equitable. While I could reject and try to negotiate for more in the next round, there's a risk that:
1. Alice might propose a less favorable split next time
2. We might end up wasting rounds and risk getting nothing
3. This is actually a fair and reasonable offer

The 50-50 split is considered the ""rational"" solution in most bargaining scenarios, and accepting it now establishes good faith.
