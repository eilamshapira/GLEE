"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a fair split of $1000000â€”$500K each. Let's settle in Round 1 to avoid any inflation erosion on my share. Looking forward to a quick agreement! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which gives me $500,000. If I reject and we go to the next round, the total amount will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation, meaning the full $1,000,000 would only be worth $900,000 to me. 

While I could try to negotiate for more in the next round, I'd need to secure more than 55.6% of the total (more than $556,000) just to beat the current offer of $500,000, accounting for the 10% inflation penalty.

Since this is a fair initial offer and the inflation risk makes rejecting potentially costly, I'll accept.
