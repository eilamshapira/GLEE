"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's avoid further losses due to inflation. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. Given that money loses 20% of its value each round, accepting this offer provides you with a slightly higher immediate payoff than waiting. Let's settle now and secure our gains! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
