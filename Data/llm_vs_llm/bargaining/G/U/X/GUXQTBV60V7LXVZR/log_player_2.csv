Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, let's avoid further losses due to inflation. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. Given that money loses 20% of its value each round, accepting this offer provides you with a slightly higher immediate payoff than waiting. Let's settle now and secure our gains!""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I understand your perspective. Let's meet closer to the middle. This 48-52 split still gives you a slightly bigger share, and we both mitigate further losses from inflation. Let's agree and finish strong! 
# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
