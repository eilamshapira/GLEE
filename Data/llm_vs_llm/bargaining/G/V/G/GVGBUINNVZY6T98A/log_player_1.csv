"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your initial offer. I think we can find something a bit more balanced, how about a 55-45 split? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Thanks for your counter-offer, Bob. I understand where you're coming from, but given the inflation effect, I feel a 45-55 split isn't quite fair to me at this point. Let's see if we can find a better middle ground in the next round.""
