600000.0,400000.0,"Let's make this fair and efficient. I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, considering the 5% inflation penalty I face with each round. This way we both walk away with a good deal without wasting value on negotiations.",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Since you face a 5% inflation penalty per round while I don't, you have more incentive to reach a quick agreement. However, I still want to be fair. This 55-45 split gives you $450000 now, which is better than getting a larger nominal amount that's worth less due to inflation in future rounds. Let's conclude this efficiently.",Bob,2,
