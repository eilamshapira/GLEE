"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's make this fair and efficient. I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, considering the 5% inflation penalty I face with each round. This way we both walk away with a good deal without wasting value on negotiations.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since you face a 5% inflation penalty per round while I don't, you have more incentive to reach a quick agreement. However, I still want to be fair. This 55-45 split gives you $450000 now, which is better than getting a larger nominal amount that's worth less due to inflation in future rounds. Let's conclude this efficiently. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With the 5% inflation penalty, if I wait another round, any amount I get will be worth 10% less than round 1 value.

Bob's offer of $450,000 at 5% inflation is worth $427,500 in round 1 terms.
If I reject and we continue to round 3, even if I managed to get $600,000, it would be worth $540,000 in round 2 terms, or $513,000 in round 1 terms.

While this isn't as good as my initial proposal, the inflation penalty makes it risky to continue negotiating. Bob's reasoning is sound, and this is still a substantial amount.
