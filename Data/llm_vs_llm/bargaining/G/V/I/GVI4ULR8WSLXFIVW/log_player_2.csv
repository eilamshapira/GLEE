"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make this fair and efficient. I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, considering the 5% inflation penalty I face with each round. This way we both walk away with a good deal without wasting value on negotiations. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice wants a 60-40 split in her favor, arguing that she faces a 5% inflation penalty per round while I face no penalty.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round:
1. Her share would be worth 5% less to her
2. I could propose a more favorable split for myself
3. She might reject, but each round reduces the value for her further

Since I don't face any inflation penalty, I can afford to negotiate for a better deal. A 60-40 split in her favor seems too generous given my stronger negotiating position.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a strategic counter-offer, considering our different positions regarding inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Since you face a 5% inflation penalty per round while I don't, you have more incentive to reach a quick agreement. However, I still want to be fair. This 55-45 split gives you $450,000 now, which is better than getting a larger nominal amount that's worth less due to inflation in future rounds. Let's conclude this efficiently.""}

This offer is reasonable because:
1. It acknowledges our asymmetric inflation positions
2. It offers Alice a substantial amount that's worth more now than a larger amount later
3. It's fair enough that it should be attractive to accept rather than risk further inflation penalties"
