60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we split it 60-40 in my favor. It's a fair start considering the game's dynamics. What do you think?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
30.0,70.0,"Alice, I propose that I receive $70 and you get $30. Given our current position and the potential effects of delay (and inflation uncertainties on your end), I believe settling now is in both our best interests. Let's conclude this quickly and fairly.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, I understand your proposal, but given the inflation affecting my share, I believe it's too skewed in your favor. Let's see if we can find a more balanced solution in the next round.",Alice,2,reject
50.0,50.0,"Bob, considering the inflation impact on my side and the need to reach a fair agreement, I propose we split it 50-50 this round. It's equitable and takes into account the urgency to settle. What do you say?",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
20.0,80.0,"Alice, I understand the pressures you feel from the inflation, but every round further reduces the real value of your share. To avoid further devaluation, I'm offering a settlement now: I receive $80 and you receive $20. Although nominally it might seem lopsided, waiting any longer will only hurt your effective gains even more. Let's agree to this deal now and put an end to the erosion.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, while I understand your point about the inflation, accepting $20 now, which is worth even less due to the compounded effect, is not in my best interest. Let's try to find a more balanced solution in the next round.",Alice,4,reject
40.0,60.0,"Bob, given the significant impact of inflation on my side, I'm proposing a 40-60 split in your favor this round. It's a compromise that acknowledges the urgency to settle while still considering the diminishing value of my share. Let's end this game on a fair note.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
7.0,93.0,"Alice, time is not on our side—every extra round further erodes the value of your share. Right now, while my amount retains full value, your $7 (which in today's terms is worth only about 7 × 0.4096 ≈ $2.87) is better than what you can expect if you delay further. I’m offering you this deal in round 6 to wrap things up immediately. Accepting now spares you even deeper losses from inflation. Let's settle this promptly.",Bob,6,
,,"Bob, given the severe impact of inflation on my share, I agree to your offer. Let's end the game here to avoid further losses.",Alice,6,accept
