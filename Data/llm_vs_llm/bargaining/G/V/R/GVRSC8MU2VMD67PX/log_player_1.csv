"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose that I receive $70 and you get $30. Given our current position and the potential effects of delay (and inflation uncertainties on your end), I believe settling now is in both our best interests. Let's conclude this quickly and fairly. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{

  ""message"": ""Bob, I understand your proposal, but given the inflation affecting my share, I believe it's too skewed in your favor. Let's see if we can find a more balanced solution in the next round.""

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the pressures you feel from the inflation, but every round further reduces the real value of your share. To avoid further devaluation, I'm offering a settlement now: I receive $80 and you receive $20. Although nominally it might seem lopsided, waiting any longer will only hurt your effective gains even more. Let's agree to this deal now and put an end to the erosion. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Bob, while I understand your point about the inflation, accepting $20 now, which is worth even less due to the compounded effect, is not in my best interest. Let's try to find a more balanced solution in the next round.""

  ""message"": ""Bob, given the significant impact of inflation on my side, I'm proposing a 40-60 split in your favor this round. It's a compromise that acknowledges the urgency to settle while still considering the diminishing value of my share. Let's end this game on a fair note.""

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, time is not on our side—every extra round further erodes the value of your share. Right now, while my amount retains full value, your $7 (which in today's terms is worth only about 7 × 0.4096 ≈ $2.87) is better than what you can expect if you delay further. I’m offering you this deal in round 6 to wrap things up immediately. Accepting now spares you even deeper losses from inflation. Let's settle this promptly. 
# Alice gain: 7 
# Bob gain: 93 
Do you accept this offer?","{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Bob, given the severe impact of inflation on my share, I agree to your offer. Let's end the game here to avoid further losses.""
