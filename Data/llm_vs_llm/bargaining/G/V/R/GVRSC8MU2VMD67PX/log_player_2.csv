"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split it 60-40 in my favor. It's a fair start considering the game's dynamics. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Alice, I propose that I receive $70 and you get $30. Given our current position and the potential effects of delay (and inflation uncertainties on your end), I believe settling now is in both our best interests. Let's conclude this quickly and fairly.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering the inflation impact on my side and the need to reach a fair agreement, I propose we split it 50-50 this round. It's equitable and takes into account the urgency to settle. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 80, ""alice_gain"": 20, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand the pressures you feel from the inflation, but every round further reduces the real value of your share. To avoid further devaluation, I'm offering a settlement now: I receive $80 and you receive $20. Although nominally it might seem lopsided, waiting any longer will only hurt your effective gains even more. Let's agree to this deal now and put an end to the erosion.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, given the significant impact of inflation on my side, I'm proposing a 40-60 split in your favor this round. It's a compromise that acknowledges the urgency to settle while still considering the diminishing value of my share. Let's end this game on a fair note. 
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 93, ""alice_gain"": 7, ""message"": ""Alice, time is not on our side—every extra round further erodes the value of your share. Right now, while my amount retains full value, your $7 (which in today's terms is worth only about 7 × 0.4096 ≈ $2.87) is better than what you can expect if you delay further. I’m offering you this deal in round 6 to wrap things up immediately. Accepting now spares you even deeper losses from inflation. Let's settle this promptly.""}"
