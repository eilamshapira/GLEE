60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, I propose that I take $60 and you take $40. With only 12 rounds to decide and potential inflation uncertainties, settling now ensures you secure a solid outcome rather than risk later losses. What do you say?",Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, let's split things a bit more evenly. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair deal for both of us to settle quickly.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
42.0,58.0,"Hi Bob, I’m proposing a split where I get $42 and you get $58. I realize that under inflation your money is slipping in value—with your share being worth 10% less in this round, $58 now is effectively about $52.20 compared to round 1 dollars. Bearing in mind that further rounds will only worsen your effective gain, this offer safeguards you against more losses while keeping things reasonably close to what you aimed for earlier. Let’s settle now to avoid further depreciation.",Alice,3,
