"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that I take $60 and you take $40. With only 12 rounds to decide and potential inflation uncertainties, settling now ensures you secure a solid outcome rather than risk later losses. What do you say?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's split things a bit more evenly. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair deal for both of us to settle quickly. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 42, ""bob_gain"": 58, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I’m proposing a split where I get $42 and you get $58. I realize that under inflation your money is slipping in value—with your share being worth 10% less in this round, $58 now is effectively about $52.20 compared to round 1 dollars. Bearing in mind that further rounds will only worsen your effective gain, this offer safeguards you against more losses while keeping things reasonably close to what you aimed for earlier. Let’s settle now to avoid further depreciation.""}"
