"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects our positions in the game. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""My turn now, let's make it a bit more interesting, shall we?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my turn to make it interesting.  This is the same split you offered me, but with inflation, it's a much better deal for me now. Don't let this opportunity slip away! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $4500 I would gain is actually worth approximately $2800 (due to 36% reduction in value from the original amount). 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Considering the inflation, I need to make a more favorable offer to myself to compensate for the loss in value.

{""bob_gain"": 6500, 
""alice_gain"": 3500, 
""message"": ""Inflation is biting, Alice. I need a better split to make it worth my while. Let's end this game with a deal that works for me.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want to maximize our gains. Let's be pragmatic and end this with a 50/50 split.  The longer we wait, the less we both get! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $5000 I would gain is actually worth approximately $4080 (due to 59.04% reduction in value from the original amount, but since it's 50% of the original 10000, it's 50% * 10000 * (1 - 0.5904) = 5000 * 0.4096 = 2048 + 2048 = 4096, which is roughly $4080, but I will use the 50% split to simplify, so 5000).

However, if I reject this offer, the value will decrease even further. A 50/50 split might be the best I can get at this point.
