"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. While $40 is a substantial amount, it's less than half of the total $100, and since I'll have the opportunity to make a counter-offer in the next round, I believe I can negotiate for a fairer split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a more equitable split, slightly in my favor since Alice's first offer was notably uneven.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I suggest this split because it's closer to an even division while maintaining a small advantage, which might be more acceptable to Alice than her initial uneven proposal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a much more reasonable offer from Alice. While it's still slightly in her favor, it's close to an even split and much better than her initial offer of 40/60. If I reject, we'll continue negotiating, but there's a risk that further negotiations might lead to a worse outcome. Given that this is a fairly reasonable split, I'll accept.
