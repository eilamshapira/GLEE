"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. Take this generous offer and we both walk away with something. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $100,000, keeping $900,000 for herself
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 10% less to me next round
3. However, this split (10%-90%) is quite unfair, and I'll have the power to make a counter-offer next round
4. Even with the 10% penalty, I can offer a much more equitable split next round
5. Alice has no inflation penalty, so she might be trying to take advantage of my time pressure

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split, considering that:
1. Money is now worth 10% less to me
2. Alice has no inflation pressure
3. I should propose something fair but attractive enough for Alice to accept

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""This is a fair 50-50 split. We both walk away with half a million dollars. There's no reason for either of us to be greedy, and this way we can both be happy with the outcome.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and the value is decreasing. I'm offering you a significant amount, let's settle this now and avoid getting nothing. 
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me evaluate this:

1. Alice has increased her offer from $100K to $150K, but it's still a very uneven split (15%-85%)
2. The money is now worth 19% less to me, so this $150K is effectively worth about $121.5K
3. We still have 9 rounds left, but my position weakens with each round
4. Alice is clearly trying to exploit my time pressure
5. However, I can still make a better counter-offer next round, even with the 28% penalty

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I believe I can still negotiate a better deal, even with the inflation penalty."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that:
1. Money is now worth 28% less to me
2. Alice has consistently shown she wants a larger share
3. I need to make an offer attractive enough for Alice while still being fair to me
4. Time pressure is mounting

I'll adjust my offer to be more appealing to Alice while still maintaining a reasonable position for myself:

{""bob_gain"": 400000,
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm showing good faith by offering you a larger share (60-40 split). This is a fair compromise that acknowledges your stronger position while still being reasonable to both of us. Let's not waste more time and risk getting nothing.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm being realistic.  This is a good deal considering how much the value decreases with each round. Don't let greed get the best of us. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has increased her offer to $200K (from previous $150K)
2. With 34.39% inflation, this $200K is worth about $131.2K to me
3. We're now in round 5 of 12, so we're almost halfway through
4. Alice is gradually increasing her offers ($100K → $150K → $200K)
5. My negotiating position is weakening significantly with each round
6. If this pattern continues, I might get a better offer in the next rounds, but the inflation will eat into any gains
7. The risk of getting nothing is becoming more real

While this is still not a great split (20-80), considering the inflation penalty and the risk of further value decay, I should probably accept this offer.
