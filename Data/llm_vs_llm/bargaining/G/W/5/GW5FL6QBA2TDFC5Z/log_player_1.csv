"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make my first offer to Bob. Since I know that with each passing round, the money is worth 20% less for me due to inflation, I should try to secure a fair deal now.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm offering an even split of the $100, which seems fair to both parties. This way, we can both walk away with a reasonable amount without risking the effects of inflation in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'm getting less than an even split, the inflation effect means that if I reject and go to another round, any amount I would receive would be worth 20% less again. Taking $40 now (worth $40) is better than potentially getting a higher nominal amount in the next round that would be worth even less due to inflation."
