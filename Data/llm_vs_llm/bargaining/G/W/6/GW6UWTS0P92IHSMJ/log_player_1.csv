"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a reasonable offer that gives both of us a good share, considering I need to account for potential inflation if negotiations drag on.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a fair offer that gives me a slight advantage as the first mover, but still leaves Bob with a substantial share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I'll get $40, but with 5% inflation, it's worth $38
- If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount I get will be worth another 5% less
- Bob seems to be pushing for a larger share
- We still have 10 rounds left, but continuing to negotiate means losing more value to inflation
- Getting $38 in real value now is better than risking further devaluation
