"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

This is the first round, and Alice has offered me $400,000 (40%) while keeping $600,000 (60%) for herself.

While this isn't an equal split, it's still a substantial amount of money. I could make a counter-offer in the next round, but there's some risk involved:
1. Alice might reject my counter-offer
2. While I don't face inflation, continuing negotiations could lead to a worse outcome if we can't reach an agreement

Given that $400,000 is still a significant sum and there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal accepted in future rounds, I'll accept this offer.
