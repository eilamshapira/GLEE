Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's money is worth 10% less each round, and this is the third round, the total value of the money for Bob has decreased by 19% (10% in round 2 and another 9% of the remaining 90% in round 3). For me, the value remains the same. Considering this, I'll make a new offer.
