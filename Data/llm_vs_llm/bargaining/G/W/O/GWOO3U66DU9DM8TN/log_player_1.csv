"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I'm playing as Alice, inflation hurts me, and I need to make an offer to Bob. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob is offering me $4000 and taking $6000 for himself. Since this is Round 2, the $4000 I would receive is worth 10% less. So, it's effectively worth $4000 * 0.9 = $3600 to me.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's my turn to propose again. In Round 3, the money I gain is worth 20% less than in Round 1 (10% less each round). So, I need to take this into account. Let's try to find a solution that Bob will hopefully accept, while also giving me a reasonable return.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500
}
```"
