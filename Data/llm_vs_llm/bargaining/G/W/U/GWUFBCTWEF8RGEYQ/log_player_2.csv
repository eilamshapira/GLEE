Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Before making an offer, I want to calculate the effective values for both Alice and me due to inflation.

For Alice, the money is worth 95% of the previous round's value each round. So, the effective values for Alice are:
- Round 4: $100 * (1 - 0.05)^3 = $85.74

For me, the money is worth 80% of the previous round's value each round. So, the effective values for me are:
- Round 4: $100 * (1 - 0.20)^3 = $51.20

Given this, let's make an offer that considers the decreasing value of the money for both of us.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Let's calculate the effective values for the next round to understand our positions better:

For Alice, the money is worth 95% of the previous round's value each round. So, the effective values for Alice in the next round would be:
- Round 6: $100 * (1 - 0.05)^5 = $77.37

For me, the money is worth 80% of the previous round's value each round. So, the effective values for me in the next round would be:
- Round 6: $100 * (1 - 0.20)^5 = $40.96

Given the significant drop in value for me, I need to strategize to ensure I get a fair share before the money loses too much value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I am trying to balance between getting a higher share due to the significant inflation impact on me and making an offer that Alice might accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The effective value for me in this round is:
- Round 7: $100 * (1 - 0.20)^6 = $32.77

The effective value for Alice in this round is:
- Round 7: $100 * (1 - 0.05)^6 = $73.51

Given the significant drop in value for me, accepting this offer ensures I get some value before the money loses even more worth. If I reject this offer, the effective value for me in the next round would be:
- Round 8: $100 * (1 - 0.20)^7 = $26.21

Therefore, accepting the offer now is a better strategy to secure some value."
