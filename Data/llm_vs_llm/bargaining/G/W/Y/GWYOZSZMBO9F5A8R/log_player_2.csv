"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair and split it 50/50. What do you say, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer. She's proposing a 50/50 split, which would give us each $50. This is a fair starting offer, but I need to consider the inflation factor as well.

If I reject and we go to the next round, the money would be worth 5% less to me. However, I would get to make a counter-offer. Given that this is a fair initial offer and the risk of inflation reducing my potential gains, I'll accept.
