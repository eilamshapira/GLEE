"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. This is the first round, so no inflation has occurred yet
2. Alice is offering me 40% of the pot
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but:
   - My money will be worth 5% less
   - Her money will be worth 10% less
   - She might reject my offer
4. While 40/60 isn't an even split, it's a reasonable offer considering:
   - I have the inflation advantage in later rounds
   - We need to reach agreement within 12 rounds
   - A bird in hand is worth two in the bush

Given these factors, I'll accept the offer. It's a decent enough split and avoiding inflation is valuable.
