"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1, keeping in mind the potential for inflation in future rounds:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

My reasoning: I'm starting with a proposal where I get a slightly larger share, but it's not so greedy that Bob will immediately reject it. I hope Bob will see it as a fair starting point and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze Bob's offer.

*   **Bob's Offer:** Alice gets $350,000, Bob gets $650,000.

*   **Inflation:** My money is worth 20% less, Bob's is worth 5% less.

Let's consider what happens if I reject and we go to Round 3. My share will be worth even less (another 20% reduction on top of the existing 20%). While Bob's inflation is lower, it's still a factor.

Here's a calculation to help me decide:

*   **Value of Bob's offer to Alice:** $350,000 * (1 - 0.20) = $280,000 (in Round 1 dollars)

While this is significantly less than my initial offer, rejecting means further devaluation. If I assume a similar offer in Round 3 (or even slightly better), the inflation will likely erode the value even further.

Therefore, I will accept this offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
