Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, the $500,000 offered to me is actually worth $500,000 * 0.95 = $475,000.

Considering this, I think the offer is not in my favor.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 5% less in each of the two rounds that have passed (total 10% less), and the money Bob gains is worth 20% less in each of the two rounds that have passed (total 36% less, but for the division, we consider the value after two rounds for Bob: 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64).

However, for the division, I'll consider the original amount and make an offer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 14.26% less, the $450,000 offered to me is actually worth $450,000 * 0.8574 = $385,815.

Considering this, I think the offer is not in my favor, as I would expect a larger share due to the greater decrease in value for Bob.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 19.26% less (5% more than the previous 14.26%), and the money Bob gains is worth 59.2% less (10.4% more than the previous 48.8%, but for the division, we consider the value after four rounds for Bob and five rounds for me, however for the offer I consider the decrease after 4 rounds for Bob: 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.4096 and for me 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.8145, then for the fifth round 0.95 * 0.8145 = 0.7738 and for Bob 0.8 * 0.4096 = 0.3277, then the ratio is 0.7738 / 0.3277 = 2.36).

However, for the division, I'll consider the original amount and make an offer.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 22.62% less, the $400,000 offered to me is actually worth $400,000 * 0.7738 = $309,520.

Considering this, and the fact that the value of the money for Bob has decreased significantly more, I think the offer is not in my favor.

I'll make an offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us.
