Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Before making my offer, I want to calculate the value of the money for both players after inflation.

For Bob (me), the money is worth 52% of the original value due to 20% loss in value per round and for Alice, the money is worth 90% of the original value after 5% decrease per round.

Let's make an offer that reflects this change in value. I could ask for more.

  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""description"": ""This offer reflects the change in value due to inflation.""

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","As we have entered round 6, the money I gain is worth 68.8% of the original value after experiencing 20% inflation per round. For Alice, the money is worth 81.4% of the original value after experiencing 5% inflation per round.

Keeping the inflation in mind, I will propose a division that benefits me more since the value of the money is decreasing faster for me than for Alice.
