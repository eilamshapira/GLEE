"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me make a strategic first offer. Since I know inflation will affect me more severely (20% vs 10% per round), I want to make a reasonable proposal that Bob is likely to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this 60-40 split because:
1. It gives me a good portion while still being fair enough to Bob
2. If Bob rejects, both of us will lose value due to inflation
3. It's better than risking further rounds where my money would be worth less"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

If I accept:
* I get $4500, but due to 20% inflation, it's worth $3600 in Round 1 terms
* Bob gets $5500, worth $4950 in Round 1 terms due to 10% inflation

If I reject and we go to Round 3:
* Money will be worth even less (40% less for me, 20% less for Bob)
* Even if I propose a better split next round, the severe inflation impact on my share makes it risky

While this isn't as good as my initial offer, the inflation penalty makes it better to accept now rather than risk another round where my money would be worth significantly less.
