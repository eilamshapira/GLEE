"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","For the first round, I'll make a fair offer considering the inflation that affects my gains in later rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose this division because while an even split might seem fair, the 10% inflation penalty only applies to me in future rounds. If we don't reach an agreement quickly, my share becomes less valuable each round, so I believe this split acknowledges that disadvantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer of a 50-50 split. While I initially asked for more due to my inflation disadvantage, a fair split is reasonable at this early stage where the inflation impact is still minimal (only 10% reduction in value for me). Getting a deal done quickly is in my interest to minimize the inflation effect, and a 50-50 split in round 2 is better than continuing to later rounds where my negotiating position would weaken further."
