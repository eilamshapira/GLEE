"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether this is a fair offer or if I should make a counteroffer, keeping in mind the 5% inflation penalty per round.

Alice is offering me $400,000 (40%) while keeping $600,000 (60%) for herself. If I reject and make a counteroffer in round 2, the total amount will be worth $950,000 due to 5% inflation. 

While her offer isn't equal, it's substantial. However, I believe I can propose a more equitable split in the next round. Since we have many rounds remaining and the first inflation hit is relatively small, I'll reject this offer to seek a more balanced division.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more equitable split while acknowledging that we've already lost some value due to inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose an equal split where we each receive half of the original amount. This is the fairest division, and accepting it now will prevent further loss of value through inflation."
