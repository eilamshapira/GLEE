"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2857 
# Alice gain: 7143 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether this is a fair offer, given the inflation rates. 

Alice is offering me $2,857 out of $10,000, which is about 28.6% of the total.

If I reject, we move to round 2 where I can make an offer. However, due to inflation, the money will be worth 20% less to me and 10% less to Alice.

Let me analyze:
- If I accept now: I get $2,857
- If I reject: In the next round, the $10,000 is worth only $8,000 to me and $9,000 to Alice
- Even if I proposed a better split in round 2, I need to account for this inflation

Since the offer gives me less than a third of the total and I have a higher inflation rate than Alice, I believe I can make a better offer in the next round that would be more favorable to me.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to make a strategic offer that accounts for our different inflation rates.

Since I'm facing 20% inflation per round while Alice faces 10%, I'm more pressured to reach an agreement quickly. However, I still want a fair share of the money.

If Alice rejects my offer, in round 3 the total would be worth $6,400 to me (20% less than $8,000) and $8,100 to Alice (10% less than $9,000).

I'll propose a more balanced split that gives Alice incentive to accept rather than continuing to another round.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2857 
# Alice gain: 7143 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this situation.

Alice has offered me the same amount ($2,857) as in Round 1, but due to inflation, this money is now worth 36% less to me than it would have been in Round 1. 

If I reject and we go to Round 4:
- My inflation would increase further (another 20%)
- The $10,000 would be worth even less to me
- I'd be making the next offer, but Alice could reject again

Given our different inflation rates (my 20% vs Alice's 10% per round), Alice has a strategic advantage by delaying. She's offered me the same nominal amount, knowing it's worth less to me now.

At this point, the $2,857 with 36% inflation is better than risking another round where my money would lose even more value.
