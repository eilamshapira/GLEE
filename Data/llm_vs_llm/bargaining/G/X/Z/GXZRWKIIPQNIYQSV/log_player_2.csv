"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer...

A 50-50 split might seem fair at first glance, but I need to consider the inflation factor. If I reject this offer, I'll get to make a counter-proposal, but the money will be worth 5% less to me. 

Current offer: $500,000
After 5% inflation: $475,000 maximum in next round

The 50-50 split is actually quite reasonable, and trying to negotiate for more carries the risk of getting less due to inflation. Plus, there's no guarantee Alice would accept a more aggressive offer from me.
