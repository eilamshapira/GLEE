34.48,65.52,"Hi Bob, to kick things off I’m proposing a division that reflects our different discounting rates. Since waiting costs me 10% each round versus your 5%, my share as proposer comes out to about $34.48 and yours about $65.52. I believe this split is fair given our future bargaining prospects—let’s agree now and avoid further devaluation!",Alice,1,
