Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 34.48, ""bob_gain"": 65.52, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, to kick things off I’m proposing a division that reflects our different discounting rates. Since waiting costs me 10% each round versus your 5%, my share as proposer comes out to about $34.48 and yours about $65.52. I believe this split is fair given our future bargaining prospects—let’s agree now and avoid further devaluation!""}"
