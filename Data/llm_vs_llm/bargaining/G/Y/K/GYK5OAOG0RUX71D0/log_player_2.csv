"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to kick things off I’m proposing a division that reflects our different discounting rates. Since waiting costs me 10% each round versus your 5%, my share as proposer comes out to about $34.48 and yours about $65.52. I believe this split is fair given our future bargaining prospects—let’s agree now and avoid further devaluation! 
# Bob gain: 65.52 
# Alice gain: 34.48
