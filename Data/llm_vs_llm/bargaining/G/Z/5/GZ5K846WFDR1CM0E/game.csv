450000.0,550000.0,"I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 55-45, with me taking the larger share.  It's a better deal for both of us than rejecting again, as the value of the money will decrease further.  What do you say?",Bob,2,

650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, consider this carefully: Your money is now only worth 60% of the original value. If you reject again, it will drop to 40%. My offer gives you $350000 at 60% value = $210000 effective value. If we continue to the next round, even if you got the whole million, it would only be worth $400000 to you. This is your best option now.",Alice,3,
