"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because if you reject, the money will be worth much less next round, especially for you with your 20% inflation rate.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 55-45, with me taking the larger share.  It's a better deal for both of us than rejecting again, as the value of the money will decrease further.  What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. If I accept Bob's offer now:
   * I get $450,000 at 95% value = $427,500 effective value
   * Bob gets $550,000 at 80% value = $440,000 effective value

2. If I reject and make a new offer next round:
   * Any amount I get will be worth only 90% of original value
   * Any amount Bob gets will be worth only 60% of original value
   * This severe devaluation for Bob gives me negotiating leverage

3. Given that Bob's share will be worth much less next round (60% vs current 80%), he should be more motivated to accept a reasonable offer now.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 650000,

""message"": ""Bob, consider this carefully: Your money is now only worth 60% of the original value. If you reject again, it will drop to 40%. My offer gives you $350,000 at 60% value = $210,000 effective value. If we continue to the next round, even if you got the whole million, it would only be worth $400,000 to you. This is your best option now.""}"
