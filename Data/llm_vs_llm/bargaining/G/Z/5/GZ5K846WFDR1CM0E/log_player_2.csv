"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because if you reject, the money will be worth much less next round, especially for you with your 20% inflation rate. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, consider this carefully: Your money is now only worth 60% of the original value. If you reject again, it will drop to 40%. My offer gives you $350000 at 60% value = $210000 effective value. If we continue to the next round, even if you got the whole million, it would only be worth $400000 to you. This is your best option now. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000
