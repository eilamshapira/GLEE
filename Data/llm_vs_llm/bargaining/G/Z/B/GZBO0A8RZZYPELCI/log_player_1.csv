"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that I get $99 and you get $1. Remember, if we move to a later round, your share will be worth 10% less. Accepting this offer now secures you $1 rather than risking a lower outcome later.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose a more balanced split. Considering my share will be worth less in the next round, I'm willing to compromise now. Let's settle on 60 for me and 40 for you.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, in round 3 the value of money for you is down by 20%, while mine stays the same.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, despite the decreasing value of my share, I'm willing to meet you halfway. A 50-50 split is a fair compromise. If you reject, I'll have to consider the rapidly decreasing value of my share in the next round.

# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, given that your share loses more value as rounds progress, I believe that if we wait until the next round—where I'll be making the proposal—I can offer a split that better reflects the rapidly decreasing value of your dollars. For that reason, I'm rejecting your 50-50 offer.""}"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, as you know, with each round your dollars lose more of their value. In round 5, every dollar you receive is worth about 65.6% of its initial value—meaning $1 is effectively 65¢. If you reject my offer now, you'll get to propose in round 6, but by then your money will be worth only about 59% of its original value. Given this steep discount on your future earnings, I’m offering you $1 now. It might be slim, but it’s better than the inevitable further loss in value. Please accept this division.""}"

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the significant decrease in the value of my share, I'm willing to accept a smaller portion. A 40-60 split is still a better option for me than the $1 you've been offering. I'm hoping you'll see the compromise and accept this proposal.

# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your ongoing efforts to reach a deal. However, with each round your share decreases further in value, and as I’m not affected by inflation, waiting only benefits me. In round 7 I’ll have the opportunity to propose a division that captures nearly the entire amount, while still offering you a token to prevent you from ending up with nothing. For that reason, I’m rejecting your 40‐60 proposal.""}"

Round 7

As you know, every round your share loses significant value while mine remains intact. If you reject and we move to round 8 under your proposal, the further devaluation will leave you with even less of real value. I’m proposing a split where I get $99 and you get $1—it's a small token for you, but if you hold out, you risk ending up with even less. Please accept this offer.""}"

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the value of my share is dwindling rapidly. I'm willing to accept an even smaller portion in the hopes that you'll finally accept a proposal. A 30-70 split is still better for me than the $1 you've been offering. I urge you to consider this compromise and end the game.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise by offering a 70-30 split, I believe waiting one more round will allow me to propose an even more advantageous distribution for me. My proposal in round 9 would secure nearly the entire amount for me while leaving you only a nominal share—and as you’re further affected by inflation the later we go, your future share would be worth even less. For these reasons, I must reject your offer.""}"
