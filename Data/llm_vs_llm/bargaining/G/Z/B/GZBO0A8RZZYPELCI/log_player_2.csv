"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I get $99 and you get $1. Remember, if we move to a later round, your share will be worth 10% less. Accepting this offer now secures you $1 rather than risking a lower outcome later. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, 
""alice_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Alice, I propose a more balanced split. Considering my share will be worth less in the next round, I'm willing to compromise now. Let's settle on 60 for me and 40 for you.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in round 3 the value of money for you is down by 20%, while mine stays the same. If you reject, you'll get to propose in round 4—but by then your dollars will be worth even less. I'm offering you $1 (which is effectively 80 cents for you) because if you hold out, you risk ending up with nothing. Please accept this offer. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4

""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Alice, despite the decreasing value of my share, I'm willing to meet you halfway. A 50-50 split is a fair compromise. If you reject, I'll have to consider the rapidly decreasing value of my share in the next round.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, as you know, with each round your dollars lose more of their value. In round 5, every dollar you receive is worth about 65.6% of its initial value—meaning $1 is effectively 65¢. If you reject my offer now, you'll get to propose in round 6, but by then your money will be worth only about 59% of its original value. Given this steep discount on your future earnings, I’m offering you $1 now. It might be slim, but it’s better than the inevitable further loss in value. Please accept this division.

# Alice gain: 99

Round 6

""alice_gain"": 60, 
""message"": ""Alice, considering the significant decrease in the value of my share, I'm willing to accept a smaller portion. A 40-60 split is still a better option for me than the $1 you've been offering. I'm hoping you'll see the compromise and accept this proposal.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, we're now in round 7. As you know, every round your share loses significant value while mine remains intact. If you reject and we move to round 8 under your proposal, the further devaluation will leave you with even less of real value. I’m proposing a split where I get $99 and you get $1—it's a small token for you, but if you hold out, you risk ending up with even less. Please accept this offer.

""alice_gain"": 70, 
""message"": ""Alice, the value of my share is dwindling rapidly. I'm willing to accept an even smaller portion in the hopes that you'll finally accept a proposal. A 30-70 split is still better for me than the $1 you've been offering. I urge you to consider this compromise and end the game.""}"

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, we’re now in round 9. Given that your share faces even steeper devaluation if we continue, your best option is to secure a token amount now. I'm offering you $1—while it may seem small, it's much more than what you'll effectively get if we drag this out any further. Please accept this offer and conclude the game.
