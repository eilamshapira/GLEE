This offer is getting worse!  I need to push for a better split before inflation eats away at my potential gains."

I'm slightly lowering my initial ask, hoping Alice might be more amenable now that we're closer to a potential agreement."

The trend is going in the wrong direction. It feels like Alice is trying to take advantage of the inflation working against me. I need to hold firm."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

Let's get straight to the point: a 50/50 split is the fairest option.  It avoids any further losses due to inflation and ensures we both walk away with a significant sum."
