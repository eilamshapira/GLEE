Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This offer is better than what I offered in the previous round, considering the inflation for Alice.  It's better to accept a slightly less favorable deal now than risk getting even less in future rounds."
