"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 19% less for me than in the first round (10% less in round 2 and another 10% less of the 90% remaining in round 3, which is 9%, so 10% + 9% = 19% total decrease). I'll try to make a more favorable offer.
