"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm proposing an even 50-50 split, which I think is the fairest approach. We both face inflation risks if we drag this out, so let's find a mutually beneficial agreement. This even split respects both our interests and prevents further value loss. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
