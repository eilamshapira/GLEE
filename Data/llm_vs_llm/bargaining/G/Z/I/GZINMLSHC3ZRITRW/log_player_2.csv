"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split this fairly. I propose 60 for me, 40 for you. This is a good starting point, and we can avoid losing value to inflation. Let's get this done quickly! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I take $40 while she gets $60. While this isn't an even split, I need to consider the inflation factor - if I reject, the money loses 5% of its value for me in the next round.

If I reject, the maximum I could propose next round would be from a total of $95 (due to my 5% inflation). And if we continue for multiple rounds, the value will keep decreasing.

While I might be able to negotiate for more by making a counter-proposal, I need to weigh that against the guaranteed $40 right now.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counter-offer that acknowledges the inflation factor while seeking a more balanced split.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm proposing an even 50-50 split, which I think is the fairest approach. We both face inflation risks if we drag this out, so let's find a mutually beneficial agreement. This even split respects both our interests and prevents further value loss.""}"
