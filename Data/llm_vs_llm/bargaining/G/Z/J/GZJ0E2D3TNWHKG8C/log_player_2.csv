"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is clearly an unfair split where Alice takes 90% of the money. Since the inflation rates affect Alice (20%) more severely than me (5%), I can make a counter-offer in the next round, and she will have more incentive to accept a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. Here's my reasoning:
1. It's a much fairer split than Alice's initial 90-10 proposal
2. Due to the higher inflation rate affecting Alice (20% vs my 5%), she has more incentive to accept now rather than continue negotiating
3. While not exactly equal, the 60-40 split acknowledges my slightly stronger negotiating position due to the inflation rate difference"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because:
1. It's a reasonable 40-60 split, much better than the initial 90-10 offer
2. If I reject, my next offer would be affected by 14.75% inflation (original 5% + 9.75%), while Alice would face 56% inflation
3. The absolute value I receive ($400,000) is still significant, and accounting for the 9.75% inflation, I'd get equivalent of about $361,000 of original value
4. Further negotiation rounds would erode the total value for both of us, and there's no guarantee of getting a better deal"
