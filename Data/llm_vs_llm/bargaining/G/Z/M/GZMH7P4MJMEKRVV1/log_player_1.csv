"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"":800000,""bob_gain"":200000,""message"":""Let's start with a solid division. I propose we take 800k for me and 200k for you. It's a fair starting point!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 50-50 split, which is fair for both of us. Remember, your money loses 20% value each round, while mine only loses 5%. A fair split now is better than waiting. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
