"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a solid division. I propose we take 800k for me and 200k for you. It's a fair starting point! 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice is offering me $200,000 out of $1,000,000
2. If I reject, I can make my own offer next round
3. The money will be worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Alice each round
4. Alice's offer gives me only 20% of the total, which is quite low
5. Given the higher inflation rate for Alice (20% vs my 5%), she has more incentive to reach a deal quickly

I'll reject this offer. With Alice's higher inflation rate, I can likely negotiate a better deal, and the 5% loss I'll take next round is worth it for the opportunity to make a counter-offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that Alice has a much higher inflation rate (20% vs my 5%), I'll propose a more balanced split while emphasizing our mutual interest in reaching an agreement quickly.
