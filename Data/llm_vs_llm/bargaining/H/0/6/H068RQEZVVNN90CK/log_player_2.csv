"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split of $50 each. This is the most equitable solution, and we can both walk away with a good amount rather than risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:
1. With inflation, $50 now is better than $50 later
2. Each round reduces my potential gain by 10%
3. 50-50 is a fair split
4. If I reject, next round I can propose, but Alice might reject and the money would be worth less

This is actually a good first offer. If I reject, my $50 would be worth $45 in the next round even if I get the same amount. There's also risk of getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds.
