"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
- Alice is offering me $40 out of $100
- While not a 50-50 split, it's still a significant amount
- There's no inflation penalty for me, but I don't know if Alice faces any
- If I reject, I can make a counter-offer, but Alice might reject it
- A bird in hand is worth two in the bush

Although I could try to negotiate for more, there's risk in rejection and the offer is reasonable enough. I'll accept.
