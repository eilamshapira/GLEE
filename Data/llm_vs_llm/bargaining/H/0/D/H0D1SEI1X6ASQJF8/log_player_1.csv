"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, so I propose a 52/48 split in your favor. Let's close the deal and avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is still worth the same, but Bob's offer is now worth less to him due to inflation, I'll consider his proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect on Bob's value, I'll make a new offer. Since Bob's value decreases by 5% each round, his offer in Round 2 was worth 95% of the original value, and now it's worth 90% of the original value (0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025). I'll try to take advantage of this.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Inflation is eating into your share, let's settle before it's too late""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this back-and-forth is pointless. Let's end this with a fair and equal 50/50 split.  Any longer and we both lose out significantly. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","An equal split, considering the inflation effect on Bob's value. Since Bob's value has decreased by 14.26% (1 - 0.8574, where 0.95*0.95*0.95 = 0.8574), I have the upper hand.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With Bob's value decreasing further, I'll make an offer that takes into account the significant loss in value he's experiencing.

{""alice_gain"": 580000, 
""bob_gain"": 420000, 
""message"": ""Time is money, and for you, time is running out - accept this offer before inflation eats away more""}"
