Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is money, and for you, time is running out - accept this offer before inflation eats away more 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

While not ideal, accepting a 42/58 split is now the best course of action.  

Here's why:

* **Significant Inflation:**  The 18.55% inflation already represents a substantial loss. Waiting any longer will only worsen the situation for me.
* **Downward Trend:** Alice's offers have consistently favored her, and there's no indication she'll agree to a more equitable split.
* **Certainty vs. Risk:** Accepting now guarantees a sizable sum, whereas rejecting it risks getting an even worse offer later."
