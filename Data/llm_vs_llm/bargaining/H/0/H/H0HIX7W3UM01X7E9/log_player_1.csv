"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair initial offer, considering that inflation will affect future rounds for me. I'll propose a balanced split.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split, which is fair for both parties and avoids the risk of rejection and subsequent value loss due to inflation."
