"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully, taking into account the 20% inflation penalty per round for me.

Alice has offered an even 50-50 split of the $1,000,000, which means $500,000 for each of us.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value to me will already be reduced by 20% (worth only $800,000 to me). Even if I were to get all of that in round 2, it would be less than the $500,000 I can get right now.

Given the significant inflation penalty I face and the fair nature of the initial offer, accepting is the rational choice.
