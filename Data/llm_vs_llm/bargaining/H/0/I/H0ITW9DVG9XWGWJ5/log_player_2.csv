"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly, Bob. I propose you get $4000 and I get $6000. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing that I get $4,000 and she gets $6,000. This isn't an even split, and I believe we can find a more equitable arrangement.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I think a fair split would be 50-50, giving us each $5000. This is the most equitable division and would benefit us both equally.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the 50/50 offer, but let's be realistic. I'm proposing a compromise: $5500 for me and $4500 for you.  Time is ticking and the value is decreasing! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice is now affected by inflation (19% less value for her), while I'm not affected by inflation yet. Her offer has improved from the first round, but it's still not quite equal. She's offering me $4,500 while taking $5,500 for herself.

Since inflation is only affecting her so far, and we still have several rounds remaining, I believe we can reach a more balanced agreement.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5200, 
""alice_gain"": 4800, 
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concerns about inflation affecting your gains. Let's meet closer to the middle - I'll take $5200 and you'll get $4800. This takes into account the inflation effect on your side while still being close to fair. We should reach an agreement soon to minimize inflation impact.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close, but we need to settle this quickly. I'm feeling the inflation pinch!  How about $5100 for me and $4900 for you? It's a slight edge to me, acknowledging the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering a more balanced split now - $4900 for me and $5100 for her. The inflation is significantly affecting her (34.39% less value), while I'm still not affected. Her offer has improved considerably from previous rounds, and we're now quite close to an even split.

Given that inflation continues to affect Alice more than me, and we're approaching a fair division, I'll accept this offer to conclude our negotiation.
