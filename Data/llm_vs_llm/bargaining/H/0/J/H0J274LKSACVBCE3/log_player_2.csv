"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 6000 and you take 4000. It's a good starting point! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

If I reject this offer:
- In the next round, I can make a counter-offer
- However, my money will be worth 20% less, so any amount I get will only be worth 80% of its nominal value
- Alice's money will only depreciate by 5%

With the current offer:
- I get $4000 at full value
- Alice gets $6000, which is a 60-40 split in her favor

While I could try to negotiate for a better split, the steep 20% inflation penalty for me means I risk getting less value by rejecting. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush, especially with such high inflation.
