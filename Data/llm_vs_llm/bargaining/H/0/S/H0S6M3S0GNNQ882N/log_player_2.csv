Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough decision as the value is decreasing rapidly. However, getting $5000 after a 36% reduction is still better than risking getting a worse offer in the next round where the value would be reduced by almost 50%."
