"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I think I can bring more to the table. How about a 60/40 split? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{

  ""message"": ""I understand your proposal, Bob, but given the inflation affecting my share, a 40/60 split isn't favorable for me. Let's see if we can find a better balance in the next round.""

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
