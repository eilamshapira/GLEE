"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it evenly, no need to wait! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if I should accept Alice's offer or make a counter-proposal.

Alice is offering an even 50-50 split ($500,000 each). However, with inflation, if I reject and move to the next round, the money will be worth 10% less to me. This means waiting would reduce the value of the entire pot to me.

If I reject now, I can make my own offer next round, but the $1,000,000 will only be worth $900,000 to me then. Even if I could get a larger percentage in round 2, I'd need to get more than 55.6% ($500,000/$900,000) of the pot to beat Alice's current offer.

Given the inflation penalty and the risk of further negotiations, Alice's fair 50-50 split is reasonable.
