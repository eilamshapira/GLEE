"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 692612 
# Alice gain: 307388 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether I should accept this offer, I need to consider the value of the money after the first round. Since the money is worth 10% less for me with each passing round, and this is the first round, the value remains at 100% for my consideration. However, I should also think about future rounds and the decreasing value for both of us.

Given that Alice's offer gives me $692,612 and her $307,388, it seems quite favorable to me at first glance. But, I should consider the potential for negotiation and the fact that the value decreases more significantly for Alice (20% per round) than for me (10% per round).

Considering it's the first round and I have a significant advantage in the proposed split, I might be inclined to reject it to see if I can get an even better deal in the next round, given the differential in value decrease. However, the risk of losing value over rounds, especially with Alice's more significant decrease, suggests that securing a good deal early might be wise.

For now, I will choose to reject the offer to see if I can negotiate a better split in the next round, considering the decreasing value of money over time for both parties.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that the money is worth 10% less for me in this round compared to the previous, and 20% less for Alice, I need to make an offer that takes into account the decreasing value but also aims to be attractive enough for Alice to accept, considering her steeper loss.

The original amount was $1,000,000. For me, it's now worth $900,000 (after a 10% decrease), and for Alice, it's worth $800,000 (after a 20% decrease).

To make a fair but advantageous offer, I'll consider splitting the original $1,000,000 in a way that favors me slightly more than the previous offer, given the decreasing value. However, I must ensure it's not so one-sided that Alice would rather wait for the next round.

Let's propose a split where I get 70% of the original amount, and Alice gets 30%. This translates to:

- My gain: $700,000
- Alice's gain: $300,000

This offer is less favorable to me than Alice's initial offer but considers the value decrease. Given Alice's larger decrease in value, she might find this offer more appealing than risking further decreases.
