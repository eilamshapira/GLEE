"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering we both want to avoid inflation eating into our gains.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This is a fair compromise given the inflation we're facing, and I believe it's a good way to start the negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think this through:
* If I accept now, I get $4500, but it's worth 10% less due to inflation, so effectively $4050
* If I reject, we go to the next round where:
   * Any amount will be worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob
   * I can make a new offer, but Bob might reject again
* Bob's current offer is reasonable given the inflation rates
* The longer we negotiate, the less value we both get
