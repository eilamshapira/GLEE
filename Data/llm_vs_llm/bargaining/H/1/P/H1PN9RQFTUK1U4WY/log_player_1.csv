"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60/40 seems reasonable""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn, 55/45 seems more reasonable to me 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same, but Bob's offer gives me less than my initial offer, and considering Bob's gain is worth 10% less to him, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 55/45 and he rejected my initial 60/40 offer, I'll try to meet him in the middle. Also, considering the inflation effect on Bob's gain, I might have an advantage.

```

  ""alice_gain"": 5750,
  ""bob_gain"": 4250,
  ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground, 57.5/42.5 is a fair compromise""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Equal split, considering the inflation, it's a good deal for me 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","An equal split! Considering the inflation effect on Bob's gain, which is now 27.1% less, an equal split is actually more favorable to me. Since the money I gain is still worth the same, I'll accept this offer.
