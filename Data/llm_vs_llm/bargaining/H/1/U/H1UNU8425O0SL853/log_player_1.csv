"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Split it evenly, fair deal""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slight advantage this round, knowing you'll want a better deal later. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the fact that the money I gain is worth 10% less, I'll calculate the effective value of Bob's offer:

My gain: 40 * 0.9 = 36 (due to 10% inflation)

This doesn't seem like a good deal for me. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a better split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less in each round, and this is the third round, I'll calculate the effective value:

Round 1: 100%
Round 2: 90%
Round 3: 81% (due to 10% inflation in each round)

To make up for the lost value, I'll try to negotiate a better split. Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 57, 
""bob_gain"": 43, 
""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a fair deal for both of us""}"
