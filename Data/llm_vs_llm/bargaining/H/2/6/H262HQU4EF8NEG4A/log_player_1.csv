"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair opening offer, considering that Bob faces a 5% depreciation per round while I don't. This gives me some negotiating leverage, but I want to start reasonably.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

This is a reasonable first offer giving me a slight advantage but still leaving Bob with a substantial sum. Since Bob faces 5% depreciation per round, they have an incentive to accept a fair offer early rather than drag out negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Bob is offering an even 50-50 split. However, I know that:
1. I have no inflation penalty, so waiting doesn't hurt me
2. Bob loses 5% value each round
3. We still have 10 rounds left
4. If Bob doesn't accept my next offer, their next counter-offer will be worth even less to them

Given these factors, I can likely get a better deal by making another offer in the next round. Bob's position weakens with each round due to inflation, while mine stays the same.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob rejected my first offer of 5500/4500 and countered with 5000/5000, which I rejected, I'll increase my share slightly. Bob is now facing 10% total depreciation on their portion (5% from each passed round), so they should be more inclined to accept a deal that favors me slightly more.

{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200}

This offer gives me a better position while still leaving Bob with a significant amount. Given that Bob's portion is now worth about 10% less to them due to inflation (so their 4200 is effectively worth about 3780 to them), they should consider accepting this rather than letting their position weaken further in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Bob has moved from their previous 50-50 offer to 5200/4800, showing some willingness to negotiate
2. However, Bob's position continues to weaken (now at 14.26% depreciation)
3. We still have 8 rounds left
4. The 4800 Bob wants is actually worth only about 4116 to them due to inflation
5. I can likely get a better deal by waiting, as my position remains strong with no depreciation

Since I'm in a stronger position and Bob's value continues to decrease, I should reject this offer and propose a more favorable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that Bob has shown some movement (from 50-50 to 52-48) but is now facing about 15% depreciation, I'll increase my demands further. Their position continues to weaken while mine remains stable, and we still have plenty of rounds left.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This offer gives me 60% of the total. For Bob, their 4000 is actually worth around 3400 due to inflation at this point. They should seriously consider accepting this offer because:
1. Their value will continue to decrease with each round
2. I can afford to wait as I face no depreciation
3. The gap between our positions will naturally widen due to the inflation mechanic
4. If they reject, my next offers will likely be even less favorable for them"
