"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing I get $4,500 while she gets $5,500 of the $10,000.

If I reject, the money will be worth 5% less to me next round, meaning the total value to me would be $9,500. I could then propose a different split. However, if we go through multiple rounds, the inflation penalty will continue to reduce the money's value for me.

Given that inflation only affects me, not Alice, I should be mindful of prolonging negotiations. While I could propose a more favorable split next round, we risk getting into a protracted negotiation where both of us might lose out.

Let me reject this first offer and propose something a bit more favorable in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll now make a counter-offer that's fair but also accounts for the inflation pressure I'm facing.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an even 50-50 split which gives us both $5,000. This is fair and equitable, and I hope Alice will accept this balanced division rather than prolonging negotiations further, which would only reduce the total value I can receive due to the 5% inflation penalty per round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Alice has rejected my fair 50-50 split and is now offering me even less than her initial offer. The inflation is already affecting the value of what I can receive, and we're now in round 3 with a 9.75% inflation penalty for me.

Let me analyze this:
- Alice is offering me $4,200, which after the 9.75% inflation penalty is worth about $3,790 to me in round 1 terms
- If I reject and we move to round 4, I'll face a 14.26% inflation penalty (5% more)
- The longer this goes, the worse my position becomes due to the asymmetric inflation

While I'm not pleased with Alice reducing her offer, I need to be strategic given the inflation pressure that only affects me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to be strategic here. Alice seems to be leveraging the inflation pressure against me, but continuing this pattern will hurt us both if we don't reach an agreement.

{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200}

I'm offering a compromise where Alice gets a slight advantage ($5,200 vs $4,800), recognizing the inflation asymmetry between us. This is a reasonable offer that gives Alice more than half while still securing a fair amount for myself, considering the circumstances. Prolonging negotiations further would significantly diminish the value I can receive, and I hope Alice recognizes this balanced proposal as a path to mutual agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice Alice continues to reject reasonable offers and is now offering me even less ($4,000). With the inflation penalty now at 18.55%, my $4,000 would be worth about $3,258 in round 1 terms.

The pattern is clear: Alice is strategically exploiting the inflation asymmetry by dragging out negotiations, knowing my position weakens each round while hers remains unchanged.

If we continue this pattern for several more rounds, I might end up with very little. Given the significant inflation penalty already incurred and the risk of getting nothing if we reach round 12 without agreement, I should accept this offer rather than risk further devaluation.
