Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5800,
""bob_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Bob, the value is decreasing with each round. I'm willing to compromise slightly, but 58/42 is my final offer.""
}
``` 

This offer attempts to strike a balance between maximizing my potential gains and securing a deal before inflation erodes the value further. It's crucial to convey a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the value is decreasing, but I believe we can find a better compromise. How about 40/60? 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this is the same division Bob initially offered, accepting is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money has decreased significantly. Waiting longer means getting even less.
* **Bob's Potential Strategy:** Bob might be aiming for a 50/50 split, and continuously rejecting offers could lead to a worse outcome for me in later rounds.
* **Certainty:** Accepting now guarantees a reasonable payout, whereas continuing carries the risk of getting a much smaller amount if we fail to reach an agreement."
