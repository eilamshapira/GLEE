"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a fair 50-50 split, but I need to consider the inflation effect. If I reject, I'll make an offer next round, but the total value will be worth 5% less to me. Let me think strategically about this.

If I accept now, I get $5,000.
If I reject and make a counter-offer, I'd be working with money that's worth 5% less to me, so the $10,000 would effectively be worth $9,500 to me.

Since Alice is offering me a fair 50-50 split right away, and rejecting would only reduce the value of any future agreement, I should accept this offer.
