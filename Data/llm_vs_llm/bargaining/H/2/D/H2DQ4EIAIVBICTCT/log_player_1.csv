"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a strategic first offer. Since Bob faces a 20% depreciation per round while I don't, he has an incentive to accept sooner rather than later. However, I don't want to be too aggressive in my first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a reasonable starting point that gives Bob a significant portion while acknowledging my stronger negotiating position due to the asymmetric inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Bob offered me 45% ($450,000) and wants 55% ($550,000) for himself
2. For Bob, this $550,000 is actually worth only $440,000 (80% of original value) due to inflation
3. If I reject, we move to round 3 where I can make another offer, but Bob's portion will be worth even less to him
4. We still have 10 more rounds, and Bob's money will continue to depreciate
5. Given my stronger position (no depreciation), I can likely get a better deal

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer since I believe I can get a better deal in the next round, especially since Bob's portion continues to lose value while mine doesn't."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's money is now worth only 64% of its original value (after two rounds of 20% depreciation), I can make a stronger offer in my favor. However, I still need to make it attractive enough for Bob to consider.

{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}

I propose a 65-35 split. For Bob, his $350,000 is actually worth only $224,000 due to the two rounds of depreciation. If he rejects this, his future gains will be worth even less. This offer balances my advantage while still giving Bob a meaningful amount that he might accept rather than risk further depreciation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob is offering a 50-50 split
2. For Bob, his $500,000 is actually worth only $256,000 (51.2% of original value) due to three rounds of inflation
3. My $500,000 maintains its full value
4. If I reject, we go to round 5, where Bob's money will be worth even less (only about 41% of original value)
5. Given that Bob's money continues to rapidly depreciate, and I still have a strong negotiating position with 8 rounds remaining

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer. Even though a 50-50 split might seem fair at first glance, Bob's rapidly depreciating position means I can likely negotiate a better deal in the next round. The fact that Bob moved from demanding 55% to offering 50% shows the pressure of depreciation is affecting his strategy."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With four rounds of depreciation, Bob's money is now worth only about 41% of its original value. His negotiating position is getting weaker with each round, so I can make a stronger offer in my favor.

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

I propose a 70-30 split. For Bob, his $300,000 is actually worth only about $123,000 due to the four rounds of depreciation. While this might seem aggressive, Bob needs to consider that:
1. If he rejects, his future gains will be worth even less
2. We're already in round 5 of 12, so the depreciation effect is significant
3. He's shown willingness to move towards more balanced offers
4. This is still better than risking further rounds where his share would be worth even less"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob is offering me 55% ($550,000) and wants 45% ($450,000)
2. For Bob, his $450,000 is actually worth only $147,435 (32.77% of original value) due to five rounds of inflation
3. My $550,000 maintains its full value
4. If I reject, we go to round 7, where Bob's money will be worth even less (only about 26.2% of original value)
5. We still have 6 rounds remaining, and Bob's position continues to weaken
6. Bob's offers have gradually improved for me (from 45% to 50% to now 55%)

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer. While Bob is offering me more than before, his rapidly weakening position due to inflation means I can likely get an even better deal in the next round. The fact that he's had to increase his offers to me shows he's feeling the pressure of the depreciation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With six rounds of depreciation, Bob's money is now worth only about 26.2% of its original value. His negotiating position is very weak, and he's shown a pattern of gradually increasing his offers to me.

{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}

I propose a 75-25 split. For Bob, his $250,000 is actually worth only about $65,500 due to the six rounds of depreciation. This offer is strategic because:
1. It continues the trend of increasing my share, but not so aggressively that Bob would definitely reject
2. For Bob, rejecting this means facing even worse depreciation in future rounds
3. We're more than halfway through the rounds (round 7 of 12)
4. His previous offer of giving me 55% shows he's willing to accept a smaller share
5. If he rejects, his future gains will be worth even less, and we risk getting nothing if we reach round 12 without agreement"
