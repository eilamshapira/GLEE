"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly and avoid inflation losses. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer.

Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which gives me $50. This is a fair division in principle, but I need to consider the inflation factor. If I reject, the total value will be worth 20% less to me in the next round (so the $100 becomes worth $80 to me). Even if I were to get a better percentage in the next round, the total amount would be less valuable.

If I reject and propose in the next round, the maximum I could reasonably hope for would be around $60-70 of the now less valuable $80 (equivalent to $48-56 of original value). And Alice might reject that anyway.

A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, especially with inflation eroding value. The fair split now is better than risking a less valuable pot later.
