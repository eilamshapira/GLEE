"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's fairly split the money! I'm offering $550000 for me and $450000 for you. This is a great deal for both of us, considering the risk of inflation as we go on. Let's secure a win now! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $450,000 out of $1,000,000
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 20% less for me in the next round
3. If I make a counter-offer, Alice might reject it, leading to further rounds and more inflation
4. The split is relatively fair (55/45)
5. Getting $450,000 now is better than risking getting less in future rounds due to inflation

This is a reasonable first offer, and considering the inflation penalty, securing a good amount now seems wise rather than risking diminishing returns in future rounds.
