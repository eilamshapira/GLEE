"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100. 

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but the money will be worth 5% less to me. So the total pot will effectively be worth $95 to me in round 2.

$40 right now is better than potentially getting a larger share of a smaller pot later, especially since Alice might reject my counter-offer and we could end up in multiple rounds of negotiation, further reducing the value due to inflation.

While a 40-60 split isn't exactly equal, it's a reasonable first offer and the inflation penalty makes accepting now more attractive than risking further rounds.
