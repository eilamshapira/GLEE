600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. With the 20% inflation affecting me each round, waiting will significantly reduce the value I receive. This is a fair offer that gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging my disadvantage due to inflation.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Alice, considering the inflation affecting us differently, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This offer takes into account the value decrease for me and still provides you with a significant share. Let's settle this round to avoid further loss in value.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I understand we both face inflation, but mine is substantially higher at 20% per round compared to your 5%. Let's meet in the middle with this 55-45 split in my favor. This accounts for my greater inflation disadvantage while still giving you a fair share. Accepting now will maximize value for both of us before further rounds erode our gains.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, given the significant impact of inflation on both of us, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This offer reflects the cumulative effect of inflation on my share, yet still ensures you receive a considerable amount. It's crucial we settle soon to preserve value for both of us.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
520000.0,480000.0,"Bob, I'm adjusting my offer to a 52-48 split in my favor. The inflation impact on me is now nearly 60% while yours is only about 19%. This offer is more favorable to you than my previous ones, acknowledging we both need to conclude this soon. My disadvantage from inflation is growing exponentially larger with each round, and this split fairly accounts for that while still giving you a substantial portion.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"Alice, with inflation now significantly affecting both of us, I propose a 65-35 split in my favor. My inflation rate, though lower, is still substantial, and this offer ensures I receive a fair amount considering the value loss over rounds. Your share, while reduced, remains significant given the urgency to settle before further depreciation. Let's end this round to secure what we can.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Bob, I'm proposing a straight 50-50 split. At this point, my gains have lost over 73% of their value while yours have only lost about 27%. This equal division acknowledges both our positions while being fair. Further negotiations will significantly harm both of us, but especially me. This is my final compromise - an even split is objectively fair, and we need to conclude this negotiation before both of us lose too much value.",Alice,7,
