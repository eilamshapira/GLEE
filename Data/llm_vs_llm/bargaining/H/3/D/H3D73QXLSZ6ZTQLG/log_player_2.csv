Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. With the 20% inflation affecting me each round, waiting will significantly reduce the value I receive. This is a fair offer that gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging my disadvantage due to inflation.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we both face inflation, but mine is substantially higher at 20% per round compared to your 5%. Let's meet in the middle with this 55-45 split in my favor. This accounts for my greater inflation disadvantage while still giving you a fair share. Accepting now will maximize value for both of us before further rounds erode our gains.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm adjusting my offer to a 52-48 split in my favor. The inflation impact on me is now nearly 60% while yours is only about 19%. This offer is more favorable to you than my previous ones, acknowledging we both need to conclude this soon. My disadvantage from inflation is growing exponentially larger with each round, and this split fairly accounts for that while still giving you a substantial portion.

My inflation rate, though lower, is still substantial, and this offer ensures I receive a fair amount considering the value loss over rounds.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm proposing a straight 50-50 split. At this point, my gains have lost over 73% of their value while yours have only lost about 27%. This equal division acknowledges both our positions while being fair. Further negotiations will significantly harm both of us, but especially me. This is my final compromise - an even split is objectively fair, and we need to conclude this negotiation before both of us lose too much value. 
# Bob gain: 500000
