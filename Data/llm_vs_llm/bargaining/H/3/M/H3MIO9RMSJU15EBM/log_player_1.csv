"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make the first proposal to divide the $10,000 between Bob and me. Given that I face 5% inflation with each passing round, I should aim for a fair proposal that Bob is likely to accept without delay.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an even 50/50 split, which is fair for both of us. This way we can both benefit equally from the money without losing value to inflation in later rounds."
