"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair on the surface. However, I should take into account the asymmetric inflation rates.

If I reject and we go to the next round, I'll be able to make my own offer, but the money will be worth 10% less to me while only 5% less to Alice. This means a 50-50 split now is better for me than the same percentage split in future rounds due to the higher inflation rate I face.

Given these circumstances, I'll accept the equal split now.
