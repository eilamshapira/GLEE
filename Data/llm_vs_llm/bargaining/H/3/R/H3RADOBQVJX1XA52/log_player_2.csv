"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this... Alice's offer would give me $400,000 while she keeps $600,000. That's not exactly an equal split, but if I reject, the total amount will decrease by 10% next round. Even if I could get a better percentage in the next round, I'd be dealing with $900,000 total instead of $1,000,000.

I'll reject this offer because I believe we should start with a more equitable split, and I can still propose a better deal even with the 10% reduction.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split while acknowledging that we should reach an agreement soon to avoid losing value.
