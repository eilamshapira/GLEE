"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. It's important to consider the effects of inflation and the time limit. I need to make an offer that Bob finds appealing enough to accept, but also maximizes my gains.

Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

Rationale:

*   **Initial Value:** I'm starting with a proposition that favors me slightly, assuming that at the beginning, Bob may be willing to concede a bit more to secure a deal early and avoid the risks of further rounds and inflation.
*   **Appealing to Bob:** 4000$ is still a substantial amount and should be appealing enough for Bob to consider, especially since it's the first round.
*   **Maximizing My Gain:** I'm aiming to secure a larger portion for myself while still ensuring a reasonable offer for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob rejected my initial offer. This tells me he's playing hardball, or thinks he can get a better deal. Also, I see his offer for Round 2. I need to calculate the actual value of the offer, considering the inflation for both of us.

Alice's inflation: 10%
Bob's inflation: 20%

Alice's Gain (Nominal): $4000
Bob's Gain (Nominal): $6000

Adjusted Alice's Gain (Value for Alice in Round 2) = $4000
Adjusted Bob's Gain (Value for Bob in Round 2) = $6000 * (1 - 0.20) = $4800

Let's see what my gain would be if I rejected and tried making an offer next turn. With the new inflation, and with the round getting closer to the deadline, I think it would be a better idea to accept this offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
