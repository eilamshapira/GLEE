"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a reasonable offer considering the inflation dynamics.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because my inflation rate is higher (20% vs your 10%), so the money devalues faster for me. If we go to another round, both of us will lose value, but I'll lose more. This offer maximizes our combined value.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's aim for a fair split of 50-50. This way, we share equally without further devaluation impacting our gains. I hope this works for you. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate if accepting Bob's 50-50 offer in round 2 is better than continuing to round 3.

With 20% inflation for me, $500,000 in round 2 is equivalent to $500,000 Ã— 0.8 = $400,000 in round 1 value.

If I reject and we go to round 3, I'd need to make a new offer, but the money would depreciate further (worth only 64% of original value to me). Even if I could get a larger share, the total value would be significantly less.

Bob's offer of 50-50 is reasonable considering the inflation pressure, and accepting now gives me more value than continuing to negotiate with increasing inflation.
