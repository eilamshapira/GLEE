"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because my inflation rate is higher (20% vs your 10%), so the money devalues faster for me. If we go to another round, both of us will lose value, but I'll lose more. This offer maximizes our combined value. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
