"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer is $400,000 for me and $600,000 for Alice
2. If I reject, we move to the next round where I can make an offer
3. However, due to 5% inflation per round for me:
   * My $400,000 in this round is worth $400,000
   * If I wait one round, any amount will be worth 5% less to me

Given that:
- The offer isn't terrible (40% for me, 60% for Alice)
- Inflation will hurt my negotiating power in future rounds
- There's risk in prolonged negotiation
- Alice may be less likely to accept a much more favorable offer to me

However, I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round, even accounting for the 5% inflation.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer while accounting for the 5% inflation that affects me:

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. This is equitable for both of us, and given the time pressure and inflation factor, it's in our mutual interest to reach an agreement soon.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle of our previous offers 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $420,000, which due to 9.75% inflation is actually worth $379,050 to me
2. This is a slight improvement from her first offer
3. If I reject:
   * Next round will have 14.25% inflation for me
   * I can make another offer, but my negotiating power is decreasing
   * Alice knows she has an advantage due to the inflation factor
4. We've already used 3 of 12 rounds
5. There's a risk of getting nothing if we can't agree in time

While I'd prefer a more equal split, the inflation is significantly impacting my position, and Alice's offer is showing some movement in my direction. Given the deteriorating value of future offers for me, I should accept this offer now.
