"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for Round 1, taking into account the effects of potential inflation in later rounds:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

My reasoning: I'm aiming for a slightly favorable split for myself to account for my lower inflation rate. I believe this is a reasonable starting point that Bob might accept."
