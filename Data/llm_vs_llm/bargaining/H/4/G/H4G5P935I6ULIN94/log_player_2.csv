"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 10% less to me (and 5% less to Alice). That means the $100 total would effectively be worth $90 to me and $95 to Alice.

With the current offer:
- I get $40
- Alice gets $60

If I reject and propose next round, I'd need to get significantly more than $40 to make up for the 10% devaluation. Also, Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to further devaluation.

While the split isn't fully equal, $40 is a reasonable amount, and the risk of getting less due to inflation in future rounds makes this offer acceptable.
