"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair initial offer, considering that money loses value faster for me (20% per round) than for Bob (10% per round). Since we both need to reach an agreement and I want to make it attractive for Bob to accept early, I'll propose:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

This is a reasonable split that gives me a slight advantage while still being attractive to Bob. If he declines, the total value will decrease for both of us, making it less optimal to delay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Due to inflation, if I accept:
   * My $400,000 is worth only 80% of original value = $320,000 effective value
   * Bob's $600,000 is worth 90% = $540,000 effective value

2. If I reject:
   * Next round will have even higher inflation
   * I'll have another chance to make an offer
   * But the total pie will be smaller for both of us

3. This offer gives Bob a significant advantage ($540,000 vs $320,000 effective value)
   * I believe I can get a better deal by making another offer
   * Even with inflation, I should be able to secure more than $320,000 effective value

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that we're now in round 3, I need to consider that:

1. For me, money is now worth 60% of original value (after two rounds of 20% decrease)
2. For Bob, money is worth 81% of original value (after two rounds of 10% decrease)
3. We need to reach an agreement soon to avoid further value loss

I'll make a more compromising offer than my first one, but still trying to compensate for my higher inflation rate:

{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000}

This offer gives Bob more than my initial proposal while still protecting my interests. Given the inflation rates, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 285714 
# Bob gain: 714286 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. If I accept:
   * My $285,714 at 51.2% value = $146,286 effective value
   * Bob's $714,286 at 72.9% value = $520,714 effective value

2. If I reject:
   * Next round money will be worth even less
   * We've already gone through 4 rounds
   * The disparity in our effective values is becoming quite large

3. This is a very unfavorable split:
   * Bob is taking over 70% of the nominal amount
   * Even accounting for inflation, the effective value gap is huge
   * I believe I can still get a better deal by making another offer

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","At this point, I need to make a more strategic offer considering:

1. We're in round 5, money has significantly devalued
   * For me, it's worth 40.96% of original value (after four rounds of 20% decrease)
   * For Bob, it's worth 65.61% of original value (after four rounds of 10% decrease)
2. We've used nearly half our rounds
3. Need to make an offer that's more likely to be accepted to avoid further value loss

I'll make a more generous offer to increase chances of acceptance:

{""alice_gain"": 475000, ""bob_gain"": 525000}

This gives Bob a slight majority while still protecting my interests enough. The declining value of money makes it crucial to reach an agreement soon, and this offer should be attractive enough for Bob to seriously consider accepting."
