"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing I get $4,500 while she gets $5,500 of the $10,000. This is slightly in her favor.

Since there's no inflation for me, I don't lose value by continuing to negotiate. I have 11 more rounds potentially, and if I reject, I'll be able to make a counter-offer in the next round. I think I can propose a more favorable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more balanced while still being reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I suggest an even 50-50 split, which would be fair to both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice has increased her offer to me slightly from $4,500 to $4,600, while taking $5,400 for herself. I also see that she's experiencing 19% inflation on her end, which means any delay is costing her more than it costs me, since I have 0% inflation.

Since I don't lose value by continuing to negotiate and Alice is facing significant inflation, I have strategic leverage. I can likely get a better offer in future rounds as the inflation pressure on Alice increases.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice is experiencing inflation (19% so far) and I'm not, I have some negotiating leverage. However, I also want to be fair enough that she accepts rather than dragging this out further. I'll propose a more equitable split that acknowledges her inflation concerns.

{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200}

I'm offering Alice a majority of the money while improving my position from her last offer. This is a reasonable compromise that accounts for both our interests."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice has again slightly improved her offer to me (now $4,700), while her inflation has increased significantly to 34.39%. This means her $5,300 is effectively worth much less to her than it would have been in earlier rounds.

Given that I experience no inflation and she's facing increasing pressure from inflation, I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. The longer this goes, the more incentive she has to reach an agreement.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that Alice is now experiencing 34.39% inflation and I'm still at 0%, her urgency to reach an agreement should be increasing. I'll propose a split that's more favorable to me but still gives her a significant portion to incentivize acceptance.

{""bob_gain"": 5100, ""alice_gain"": 4900}

I'm proposing that I get $5,100 and Alice gets $4,900. This gives me a slight majority while still keeping the offer within a reasonable range that acknowledges we both need to reach an agreement within our remaining rounds."
