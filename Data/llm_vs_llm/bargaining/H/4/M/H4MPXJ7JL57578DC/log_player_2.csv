"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given Alice's offer, I need to consider whether to accept or proceed to the next round.

Current offer: I get $4000, Alice gets $6000.

If I reject, I'll make a counter-offer in the next round. For me, the money doesn't lose value (0% inflation). But for Alice, the money will be worth 20% less in the next round.

I believe I can propose a better split for myself in the next round, especially since Alice faces significant time pressure due to her 20% inflation rate.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll now make my counter-offer. I need to consider that Alice faces 20% inflation per round, which gives me some leverage.

Alice originally offered me $4000, keeping $6000 for herself. Given her time pressure (20% inflation), I can propose a more favorable split for myself while still making it rational for her to accept rather than delay further.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

With this offer, I'm proposing a reversal of Alice's original offer. Since Alice would only get the equivalent value of $3200 (80% of $4000) if she rejects and we go to another round, this should be a rational choice for her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's latest offer in Round 3.

Current offer: I get $4,200, Alice gets $5,800.

Key considerations:
- I face 0% inflation, so $4,200 has full value for me
- Alice faces 36% inflation so far (cumulative from previous rounds)
- If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in Round 4
- But if we go to Round 4, Alice will face even more inflation (likely 48-50%)

Alice has slightly improved her offer from $4,000 to $4,200 for me. However, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal, especially since Alice's time pressure continues to increase with each round. The inflation significantly weakens her bargaining position.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll now make my counter-offer. Alice faces significant time pressure with 36% inflation already and would face approximately 50% inflation if she rejects this offer.

Her last offer gave me $4,200, which shows she's starting to concede more to me due to her inflation pressure. I should propose an offer that's better for me but still rational for Alice to accept given her time constraints.

{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500}

With this offer, I'm giving Alice $3,500. If she rejects and we go to another round, her money would be worth about 50% less, meaning any future offer would need to exceed $7,000 for her to get equivalent value to accepting $3,500 now. This makes accepting this offer the rational choice for her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me evaluate Alice's latest offer in Round 5:

Current offer: I get $4,400, Alice gets $5,600.

Key considerations:
- I face 0% inflation, so $4,400 has full value for me
- Alice now faces 59.04% inflation from the first round
- Alice has again improved her offer from $4,200 to $4,400
- If I reject, Alice will face approximately 67% inflation in the next round

Alice continues to increase her offers incrementally, showing the pressure of inflation is affecting her strategy. However, given her severe inflation penalty (almost 60%), I still have significant leverage.

The difference between our positions continues to grow with each round. While $4,400 is better than her previous offers, I believe I can still negotiate a more favorable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll now make my counter-offer. Alice is under extreme time pressure with 59.04% inflation already, and would face approximately 67% inflation if she rejects this offer and moves to round 7.

Her offers have been gradually improving ($4000 → $4200 → $4400), showing she recognizes her weakening position. Given her significant inflation penalty, I should make an offer that reflects my stronger bargaining position while still being rational for her to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000}

With this offer, I'm giving Alice $3,000. If she rejects and we go to another round, her money would be worth about 67% less, meaning the $3,000 now is worth more to her than even a much larger amount in future rounds. Since $3,000 now is worth more than $5,000 in the next round for her (due to inflation), this should be a rational offer for her to accept."
