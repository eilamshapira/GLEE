517378.0,482622.0,"Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I get $517378 and you get $482622. This offer is calculated so that, if you were to reject it, your best alternative in the next round (factoring in the 20% devaluation) would yield about $482622 relative to today’s full value. I believe this is a fair division given our limited rounds. Let’s agree now and avoid further loss in value.",Alice,1,
