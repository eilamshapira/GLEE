"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 517378, ""bob_gain"": 482622, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I get $517,378 and you get $482,622. This offer is calculated so that, if you were to reject it, your best alternative in the next round (factoring in the 20% devaluation) would yield about $482,622 relative to today’s full value. I believe this is a fair division given our limited rounds. Let’s agree now and avoid further loss in value.""}"
