"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I get $517378 and you get $482622. This offer is calculated so that, if you were to reject it, your best alternative in the next round (factoring in the 20% devaluation) would yield about $482622 relative to today’s full value. I believe this is a fair division given our limited rounds. Let’s agree now and avoid further loss in value. 
# Bob gain: 482622 
# Alice gain: 517378 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Current offer to me: $482,622
2. If I reject:
   * Next round value: $800,000 (20% less than $1M)
   * If I propose a very favorable split next round, I could get more
   * But Alice could reject, leading to further devaluation
   * After several rejections, we risk getting nothing

Alice's reasoning is strategic, and her offer is actually quite reasonable:
- It's close to a 50-50 split (48.2% vs 51.7%)
- The difference isn't worth the risk of further devaluation
- Given the 20% devaluation per round, getting a better deal becomes increasingly difficult

This is a good first-round offer that gives me a substantial portion while avoiding the risk of value loss through continued negotiation.
