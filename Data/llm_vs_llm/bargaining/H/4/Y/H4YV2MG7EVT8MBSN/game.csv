550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob! I'm proposing a fair division that slightly favors me as the first mover. This is a reasonable split that gives you a substantial portion, and we can avoid the risk of running through all 12 rounds and both getting nothing.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
475000.0,525000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I think a more balanced split would be fair considering we both want to avoid the risk of getting nothing after 12 rounds.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
525000.0,475000.0,"Hi Bob, I understand your counterproposal, but I still think I deserve a bit more as the first mover. I've reduced my request to 525k, which is a fair compromise between our positions. This gives you a very substantial 475k, and we avoid risking everything by drawing this out too long.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
487500.0,512500.0,"Hi Alice, I see we're getting closer. Considering we've both made concessions, I think a split closer to 50/50 is reasonable. This offer still gives you a slight advantage for being the first mover, but also acknowledges my position.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
510000.0,490000.0,"Hi Bob, I see we're converging. I've moved down significantly from my initial position. This 51/49 split is very fair and recognizes both our positions - just a slight advantage to me as the first mover. Let's finalize this deal now rather than risking further rounds that could lead to neither of us getting anything.",Alice,5,

495000.0,505000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate the movement towards a more balanced split. Given we're so close, I'm willing to meet you almost in the middle, with just a slight adjustment in my favor to reflect the fact that we're now well into the negotiations and the first mover advantage is diminishing.",Bob,6,
