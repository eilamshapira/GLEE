{
""alice_gain"": 525000,
""bob_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your counterproposal, but I still think I deserve a bit more as the first mover. I've reduced my request to 525k, which is a fair compromise between our positions. This gives you a very substantial 475k, and we avoid risking everything by drawing this out too long.""

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I see we're getting closer. Considering we've both made concessions, I think a split closer to 50/50 is reasonable. This offer still gives you a slight advantage for being the first mover, but also acknowledges my position.

""bob_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I see we're converging. I've moved down significantly from my initial position. This 51/49 split is very fair and recognizes both our positions - just a slight advantage to me as the first mover. Let's finalize this deal now rather than risking further rounds that could lead to neither of us getting anything.""

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the movement towards a more balanced split. Given we're so close, I'm willing to meet you almost in the middle, with just a slight adjustment in my favor to reflect the fact that we're now well into the negotiations and the first mover advantage is diminishing. 
# Alice gain: 495000 
# Bob gain: 505000
