"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm proposing a fair division that slightly favors me as the first mover. This is a reasonable split that gives you a substantial portion, and we can avoid the risk of running through all 12 rounds and both getting nothing.

# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your counterproposal, but I still think I deserve a bit more as the first mover. I've reduced my request to 525k, which is a fair compromise between our positions. This gives you a very substantial 475k, and we avoid risking everything by drawing this out too long.

""alice_gain"": 487500,

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see we're converging. I've moved down significantly from my initial position. This 51/49 split is very fair and recognizes both our positions - just a slight advantage to me as the first mover. Let's finalize this deal now rather than risking further rounds that could lead to neither of us getting anything.

""alice_gain"": 495000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the movement towards a more balanced split. Given we're so close, I'm willing to meet you almost in the middle, with just a slight adjustment in my favor to reflect the fact that we're now well into the negotiations and the first mover advantage is diminishing.""}"
