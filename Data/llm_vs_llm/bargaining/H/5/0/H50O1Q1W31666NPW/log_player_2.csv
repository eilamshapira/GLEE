"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's start with a fair split favoring me slightly. This gives us both a good amount of money in the first round before inflation hits too hard. Accept this and we both win! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:

1. The total amount is $10,000, and she's offering me $4,500 (45%)
2. It's the first round, so there's no inflation yet
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer, but the total will be worth 20% less ($8,000)
4. The split is relatively fair, though slightly in her favor
5. Getting $4,500 right now is better than risking further negotiations with inflation

While I could try to negotiate for a 50-50 split, the risk of inflation eating into our gains makes this a reasonable offer. It's better to secure a good amount now than risk losing value through extended negotiations.
