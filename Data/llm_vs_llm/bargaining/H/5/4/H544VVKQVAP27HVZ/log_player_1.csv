"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split while accounting for the possibility of future rounds and inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest a slightly favorable split for me while still giving Bob a substantial portion. If Bob refuses, the next round's $100 will be worth only $90 to me due to inflation, so this is a reasonable first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this... 

Due to 10% inflation, if I accept this offer now, the $50 I would receive is actually worth $45 to me. If I reject and make a new offer next round, I'll face another 10% inflation, making the next round's dollars worth even less to me.

Given that:
1. This is a fair 50-50 split
2. Rejecting would lead to further value loss due to inflation
3. We don't know Bob's inflation rate
4. We still have many rounds left but each delay costs me money

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because while it's not ideal, the inflation penalty makes waiting costly for me, and this is a reasonable compromise."
