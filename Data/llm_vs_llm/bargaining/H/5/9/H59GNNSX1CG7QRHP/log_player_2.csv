"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me after each round, I'll make a more favorable offer to Alice to increase the chances of her accepting it.

{""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""message"": ""More reasonable split, considering inflation""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer, still a good deal 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the 9.75% decrease in value for me, the actual value of Alice's offer is approximately:

420000 * 0.9025 = 379050

This is still a significant amount, but I'll think about the potential future offers and the decreasing value due to inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth even less for me now (5% less each round, so 14.76% less than in the first round), I'll make a more generous offer to Alice to increase the chances of her accepting it.
