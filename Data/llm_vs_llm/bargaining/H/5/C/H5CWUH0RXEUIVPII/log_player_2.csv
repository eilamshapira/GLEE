"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split reflects the importance of early agreement. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $400,000 for me
2. If I reject and go to next round:
   * The money will be worth 20% less to me
   * Maximum I could propose would be worth $800,000 (80% of original value)
   * But Alice might reject that, leading to further rounds and more inflation

While 60-40 split in Alice's favor isn't ideal, it's still a substantial amount. Given the significant inflation penalty and uncertainty of future rounds, accepting this reasonable first offer is probably better than risking further devaluation.
