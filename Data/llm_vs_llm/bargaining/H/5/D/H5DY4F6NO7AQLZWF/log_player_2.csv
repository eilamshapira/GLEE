"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically.

The current offer is $4,000 for me and $6,000 for Alice.

If I reject, we move to the next round where:
- I can make an offer
- But my money will be worth 20% less
- Alice's money will only be worth 5% less
- This means the $10,000 total will effectively be worth $8,000 for me and $9,500 for Alice

Given the significant inflation penalty I face (20%), getting $4,000 now is better than risking a negotiation where my bargaining power is reduced by such a large depreciation.

While the split isn't entirely in my favor, it's reasonable enough given the inflation risk I face.
