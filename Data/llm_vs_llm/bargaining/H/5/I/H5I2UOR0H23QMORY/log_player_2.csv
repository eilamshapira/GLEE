"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically. 
$400,000 is a substantial amount, but it's less than half of the total $1,000,000. 

Given that:
1. This is just the first round
2. I can make a counter-offer next round
3. There's no inflation effect for me
4. I have bargaining power with many rounds remaining

I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer, but still slightly in my favor. Since there are many rounds left and no inflation affecting me, I can afford to be reasonable while still seeking a good deal.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I propose a 55-45 split, which is more equitable than the previous offer while giving me a slight advantage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is actually a worse offer than her first one - she's asking for more despite her money being worth less due to inflation (650K vs 600K initially), while offering me less (350K vs 400K initially).

Given that:
1. We still have 9 rounds left
2. I'm not affected by inflation
3. Alice is experiencing 19% inflation, so her money is worth less each round
4. She should be more motivated to reach a deal due to her inflation penalty

I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice is experiencing inflation (her money is worth 19% less), while I'm not affected, I can leverage this to make an offer that looks better for her in nominal terms while still being advantageous for me.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split. Given that Alice is facing inflation, she might be more inclined to accept a slightly lower nominal amount now rather than risk further devaluation of her share in later rounds. This offer is still reasonable enough that it could lead to an agreement, while improving my position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer is even worse than her previous ones. Let's analyze:
1. She's asking for 700K (but it's worth only 459,220 to her due to 34.39% inflation)
2. She's offering me only 300K (lower than both her previous offers of 400K and 350K)
3. We still have 7 rounds left
4. Her inflation penalty is getting more severe (34.39% now vs 19% before)
5. I'm still not affected by inflation

Given that her money is worth significantly less now, she should be more motivated to reach a deal quickly. There's no reason for me to accept a lower amount when I have more negotiating leverage due to her inflation problem.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that Alice's money is now worth 34.39% less, she should be more motivated to reach a deal. However, my previous offer of 60-40 was rejected, so I need to find a better balance that she might accept while still taking advantage of my stronger position.

{""bob_gain"": 575000, ""alice_gain"": 425000}

I'm slightly reducing my demand from the previous 60-40 split to a 57.5-42.5 split. This is still advantageous for me but might be more acceptable to Alice because:
1. Her share (425K) is higher than my last offer (400K)
2. With inflation making her money worth less each round, she should be motivated to reach a deal soon
3. This is still a fair offer considering I'm not affected by inflation
4. We're about halfway through the rounds, so the pressure to reach a deal is increasing"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 275000 
# Alice gain: 725000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze this offer:
1. Alice is asking for 725K, but due to 46.86% inflation, it's only worth about 385K to her
2. She's offering me even less than before (275K vs previous 300K)
3. Her inflation penalty has increased significantly (46.86%)
4. We still have 5 rounds left
5. I'm still not affected by inflation

This offer is getting worse with each round. She's asking for more nominal money while offering me less, even though her money is worth much less due to inflation. Her strategy doesn't make sense as she should be more eager to reach a deal given her severe inflation penalty.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that Alice's money is now worth 46.86% less, I need to craft an offer that recognizes both our positions:

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm reducing my demand slightly from my last offer (575K-425K) to a 55-45 split. Here's my reasoning:

1. Alice's 450K, even with 46.86% inflation (worth ~239K to her), is still better than continuing to negotiate while facing increasing inflation
2. We're now in round 8 of 12, so time pressure is building
3. I'm showing willingness to compromise by reducing my share
4. This is still a good deal for me since I'm not affected by inflation
5. If Alice rejects this more generous offer, I can still make more aggressive offers in later rounds as her inflation penalty increases"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze this latest offer:
1. Alice's 750K is only worth about 323K to her (after 56.95% inflation)
2. She's offering me even less (250K vs previous 275K)
3. Her inflation penalty is now severe at 56.95%
4. Only 3 rounds remain after this
5. I'm still not affected by inflation

Her strategy continues to be puzzling - she's asking for more nominal money while offering me less, even though her money is worth less than half of its original value due to inflation. She should be more desperate to reach a deal, not less generous.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With only 2 rounds remaining after this one and Alice's money now worth 56.95% less, it's critical to make an offer that could lead to agreement while maintaining my advantageous position.

{""bob_gain"": 525000, ""alice_gain"": 475000}

I'm making a more generous 52.5-47.5 split because:

1. Alice's 475K, even with 56.95% inflation (worth ~204K to her), is better than risking getting nothing if we reach round 12
2. Only 2 rounds remain after this, significantly increasing pressure to reach a deal
3. I'm showing substantial willingness to compromise by offering my lowest share yet
4. It's still advantageous for me since I'm not affected by inflation
5. If we don't reach agreement in these final rounds, we both get nothing, which would be worse for both of us

This offer balances my desire for a good outcome with the increasing urgency to reach a deal before we both lose everything."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 65.13% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 225000 
# Alice gain: 775000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze this critical situation:
1. Only 1 round remains after this
2. Alice's 775K is only worth about 270K to her (after 65.13% inflation)
3. She's offering me even less (225K)
4. If we don't reach agreement in the next round, we both get nothing
5. I'm still not affected by inflation

Even with the extreme time pressure, this offer is still not acceptable because:
- She continues to reduce my share despite her severe inflation penalty
- I can make one final offer next round
- While risky, rejecting this gives me one last chance to propose a more balanced split
- Her persistently aggressive strategy despite her weakening position suggests she might be willing to risk getting nothing

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 11.
Round 12
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","This is the final round - if Alice rejects this offer, we both get nothing. I need to make my most strategic offer considering the extreme circumstances:

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a perfect 50-50 split because:

1. This is the last chance for either of us to get anything
2. Even with 65.13% inflation, Alice's 500K (worth ~175K to her) is still better than getting nothing
3. A perfectly equal nominal split is psychologically appealing and appears maximally fair
4. The alternative to accepting this offer is zero for both of us
5. While I could maintain a more aggressive position, the risk of getting nothing outweighs the potential benefit of a larger share

This final offer represents the best balance between maintaining my interests and maximizing the chances of reaching an agreement rather than both of us walking away with nothing."
