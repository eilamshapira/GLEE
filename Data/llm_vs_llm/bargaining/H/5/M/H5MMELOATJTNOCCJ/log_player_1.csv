"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, let's be reasonable. How about a 55/45 split? It's more in line with an even split while acknowledging the time pressure. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{
