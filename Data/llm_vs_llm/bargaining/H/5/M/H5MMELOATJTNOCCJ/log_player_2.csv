Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's go for an even split this time, 50-50. Given the inflation hitting both of us, it seems like the fairest way to end this quickly. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
