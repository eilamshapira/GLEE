"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation affects you more than me, this split accounts for your loss in value over time. Let's settle this early to avoid further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the fact that the money I gain is worth 5% less, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the total amount is $1,000,000 and it's worth 5% less to me, the actual value I consider is $1,000,000 * 0.95 = $950,000.

Bob's offer gives me $450,000, which is approximately 47.4% of the total value I consider.

I think I can do better than this, so I'll reject the offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 10% less than the original value (5% less in Round 1 and another 5% less in Round 2).

The total amount is $1,000,000, and it's worth 10% less to me, so the actual value I consider is $1,000,000 * 0.9 = $900,000.

I'll make a new offer, trying to balance my loss due to inflation with the need to make a reasonable proposal.

{""alice_gain"": 470000, 
""bob_gain"": 530000, 
""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground. This split takes into account the inflation affecting my share.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This split takes into account the inflation impact on your share. It's a fair deal for both of us, and it's better to settle early to avoid further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 460000 
# Bob gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection from Bob. Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 15% less than the original value (5% less in Round 1, 5% less in Round 2, and 4.26% less in Round 3, which is the remaining inflation for this round, 5% - 0.74% = 4.26%, 0.74% is the remaining value from the previous round, (100 - 5)% * (100 - 5)% * (100 - 5)% = 85.7375%, and 100% - 85.7375% = 14.2625%, which is the total inflation).

The total amount is $1,000,000, and it's worth 14.26% less to me, so the actual value I consider is $1,000,000 * 0.8574 = $857,400.

Bob's offer gives me $460,000, which is approximately 53.6% of the total value I consider.

While it's not an ideal split, I need to consider the fact that the inflation will continue to decrease the value of my share in subsequent rounds. I'll have to weigh the potential benefits of waiting for a better offer against the risks of losing more value due to inflation.

For now, I'll reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 19.26% less than the original value (5% less in Round 1, 5% less in Round 2, 4.26% less in Round 3, and 5% less in Round 4).

The total amount is $1,000,000, and it's worth 19.26% less to me, so the actual value I consider is $1,000,000 * 0.8074 = $807,400.

I'll make a new offer, trying to balance my loss due to inflation with the need to make a reasonable proposal. Since Bob's previous offer was $460,000 for me and $540,000 for him, I'll try to make a slightly more favorable offer for myself.
