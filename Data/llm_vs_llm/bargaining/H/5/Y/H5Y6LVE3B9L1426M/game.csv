5556.0,4444.0,"Hi Bob, to avoid the 20% depreciation that comes with delay, I propose that I receive $5556 and you get $4444 right away. This division reflects the fact that if we continue, the total pie shrinks, so accepting now secures a fair share for you. Let's settle this now and avoid further losses!",Alice,1,

5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Alice, I understand we both want to avoid depreciation, which is why I'm proposing a simple 50-50 split of $5000 each. This is the fairest division, and it allows us both to walk away with equal amounts right now. If we continue to the next round, we'd lose $2000 in total value, which hurts both of us. Let's agree to this equal split and both benefit.",Bob,2,
