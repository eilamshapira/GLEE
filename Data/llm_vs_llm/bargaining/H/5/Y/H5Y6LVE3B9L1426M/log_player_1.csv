"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5556, ""bob_gain"": 4444, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, to avoid the 20% depreciation that comes with delay, I propose that I receive $5,556 and you get $4,444 right away. This division reflects the fact that if we continue, the total pie shrinks, so accepting now secures a fair share for you. Let's settle this now and avoid further losses!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand we both want to avoid depreciation, which is why I'm proposing a simple 50-50 split of $5000 each. This is the fairest division, and it allows us both to walk away with equal amounts right now. If we continue to the next round, we'd lose $2000 in total value, which hurts both of us. Let's agree to this equal split and both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
