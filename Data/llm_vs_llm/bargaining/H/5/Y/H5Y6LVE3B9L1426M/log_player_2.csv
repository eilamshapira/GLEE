"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to avoid the 20% depreciation that comes with delay, I propose that I receive $5556 and you get $4444 right away. This division reflects the fact that if we continue, the total pie shrinks, so accepting now secures a fair share for you. Let's settle this now and avoid further losses! 
# Bob gain: 4444 
# Alice gain: 5556 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice is proposing I get $4444 while she gets $5556. While she's correct that waiting means the total amount decreases, the division isn't equal. In the first round, a fair split would be closer to 50-50 since we're just starting and have equal bargaining power.

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, though the total will be worth 20% less (so $8,000 total value). But I'll have the advantage of making the offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more equitable offer that acknowledges the time pressure while being fair to both of us.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand we both want to avoid depreciation, which is why I'm proposing a simple 50-50 split of $5000 each. This is the fairest division, and it allows us both to walk away with equal amounts right now. If we continue to the next round, we'd lose $2000 in total value, which hurts both of us. Let's agree to this equal split and both benefit.""}"
