"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $600,000 and giving Bob $400,000, with a message suggesting that this is a fair starting point. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, a fair share for both. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, the $500,000 offered by Bob is actually worth $500,000 * 0.9 = $450,000 to me.

Considering this, I think I can do better than that. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less with each passing round, and we're now in Round 3, the money I gain is worth 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 of its original value.

To account for this, I'll make an offer that's more favorable to myself. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 650000,
  ""bob_gain"": 350000,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I need a better deal. Let's try 65/35.""
}
```

Let's see how Bob responds to this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: With inflation, let's adjust to a 55/45 split in your favor. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 27.1% less due to inflation, the $550,000 offered by Bob is actually worth $550,000 * (1 - 0.271) = $402,450 to me.

Considering this, and the fact that Bob's offer is more favorable to me than his previous one, I think I should accept this offer. Rejecting it would lead to another round of inflation, which would further decrease the value of the money I gain.
