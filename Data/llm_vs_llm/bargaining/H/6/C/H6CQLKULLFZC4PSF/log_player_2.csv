"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. In this round, I would get $400,000 at full value. If I reject and make a counter-offer, the money will be worth 20% less to me, but only 5% less to Alice.

If I reject:
- My next offer would be effectively worth 20% less to me
- I could offer a better split, but Alice might reject it, leading to even more depreciation
- The asymmetric depreciation (20% vs 5%) puts me at a disadvantage in later rounds

While 400k vs 600k isn't an even split, it's a substantial amount, and the risk of losing value in subsequent rounds makes this a reasonable offer. The depreciation factor makes it risky to reject.
