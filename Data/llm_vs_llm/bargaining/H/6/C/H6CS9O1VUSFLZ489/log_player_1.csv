"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I want to propose a fair division that takes into account the inflation penalty I face.

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose this split because I face a 5% inflation penalty each round, so getting a deal done now is valuable to me. This division gives you a substantial portion while allowing me to avoid inflation losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Looking at our negotiation pattern, I'll adjust my offer to find middle ground.

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose an equal split of $50 each. This is fair for both of us, and given that we both face inflation penalties (mine at 5% per round, yours at 10% per round), it's in our mutual interest to reach an agreement now rather than continue negotiating and losing value."
