Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, the impact of inflation is significant. Here's why I accept:

* **My Loss:** Due to inflation, the $50 I receive now is worth 19% less than it was in Round 1. This is a substantial decrease in value.
* **Alice's Loss:** Alice also experiences a loss due to inflation, but only at 9.75%. This means her $50 is worth more than my $50 in relative terms. 

By accepting, I'm securing a reasonable amount even with the inflation penalty. Rejecting and hoping for a better offer in the next round is too risky. The longer the game goes on, the more value we both lose."
