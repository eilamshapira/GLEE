400000.0,600000.0,"Hi Bob, for Round 1 I propose that you receive $600000 and I receive $400000. As you know, each round that passes costs me 10% in value due to inflation while our total pot remains fixed. I’m eager to settle now to avoid further losses – please consider that delaying might only increase risks for both of us. Looking forward to your thoughts!",Alice,1,
