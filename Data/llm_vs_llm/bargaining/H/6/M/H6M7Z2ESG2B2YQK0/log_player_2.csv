"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, for Round 1 I propose that you receive $600000 and I receive $400000. As you know, each round that passes costs me 10% in value due to inflation while our total pot remains fixed. I’m eager to settle now to avoid further losses – please consider that delaying might only increase risks for both of us. Looking forward to your thoughts! 
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me 60% ($600,000) of the total amount
2. I know my inflation rate is 5% per round
3. Alice claims her inflation rate is 10%, but I can't verify this
4. If I reject, in the next round:
   - My $600,000 would be worth $570,000 (5% less)
   - I could propose a different split, but Alice might reject
5. The current offer is quite favorable already
6. There's risk in prolonging negotiations

Given that:
- The offer is already in my favor (60/40 split)
- Inflation will definitely reduce my value in future rounds
- There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal later
- Alice might be less willing to accept generous offers in later rounds

I'll accept this offer.
