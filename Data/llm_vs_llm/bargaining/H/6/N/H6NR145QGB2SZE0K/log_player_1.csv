"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm proposing a more balanced split of 55/45. Given that the money depreciates faster for you (20%) than for me (10%), this is actually a fair offer. If we continue to the next round, we'll both lose value, so this is mutually beneficial. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the fact that the money I gain is worth 20% less, I should take into account the actual value I'd receive.

Since the initial amount was $10,000 and it's worth 20% less for me, the current value for me is $10,000 * 0.8 = $8,000. Bob's offer of $4,500 would be 56.25% of the current value for me ($4,500 / $8,000).

Given Bob's offer and the depreciation of the money, I think it's a reasonable proposal.
