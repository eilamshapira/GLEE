"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40, a fair start 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $4000 and she gets $6000. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, I should remember that the money will be worth 10% less to me and 20% less to Alice due to inflation.

Since I would be making the proposal in the next round, I might be able to secure a better deal than this 40/60 split. Given the asymmetric inflation rates, my negotiating position actually improves in later rounds.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I need to make a strategic offer based on our inflation rates. Since money depreciates faster for Alice than for me, I can use this to propose a more favorable split.

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm proposing a more balanced split of 55/45. Given that the money depreciates faster for you (20%) than for me (10%), this is actually a fair offer. If we continue to the next round, we'll both lose value, so this is mutually beneficial.""}"
