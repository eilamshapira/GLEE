"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","For the first round, I'll make a reasonable offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, I want to make a deal quickly. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

This is a fair 50-50 split. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I need to consider the actual value of the money. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, the $4000 Bob is offering me is actually worth $4000 * 0.8 = $3200 to me.

On the other hand, Bob's $6000 is worth $6000 * 0.95 = $5700 to him.

Considering this, I think I can do better than that. My response is:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob rejected my initial offer and his counteroffer wasn't favorable to me, I'll try to make a more appealing proposal this time. Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 20% * 2 = 40% less than the initial value (20% less in round 1 and another 20% less in round 2, combined), and the money Bob gains is worth 5% * 2 = 10% less.

However, for simplicity, I'll calculate the value reduction round by round. In round 2, the value for me was 80% of the original, and now in round 3, it will be 80% * 0.8 = 64% of the original value for me. For Bob, it was 95% in round 2, and now it will be 95% * 0.95 = 90.25% of the original value.

Given this, I'll aim for a split that reflects these diminishing values but still tries to be reasonable for both parties. I'll offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

This offer gives me a bit more, considering the faster depreciation of the money's value for me, but still leaves a significant amount for Bob. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! Given the inflation rates, I need to carefully consider Bob's new offer.

The money I gain is now worth 48.8% less than in the first round, which means the $3500 Bob is offering me is actually worth $3500 * (1 - 0.488) = $3500 * 0.512 = $1792 to me.

On the other hand, Bob's $6500 is worth $6500 * (1 - 0.1426) = $6500 * 0.8574 = $5571.1 to him.

Considering the significant disparity in our perceived values due to inflation, I think I should reject this offer as well. It seems too skewed in Bob's favor.

My response is:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer was not favorable to me, I'll try to make a more balanced proposal in this round. Considering the inflation, the value of the money for me has decreased significantly, while Bob's value has decreased relatively less.

To calculate the exact decrease:
- For me, the value was 64% of the original in round 3, and now in round 5, it will be 64% * 0.8 = 51.2% of the original value (since it decreases by 20% each round, and we had round 3 and now round 5, so two 20% decreases).
- For Bob, the value was 90.25% in round 3, and now in round 5, considering two rounds of 5% decrease, it will be 90.25% * 0.95 * 0.95 = 90.25% * 0.9025 = 81.41% of the original value.

Given these values, I'll aim for a split that tries to account for the diminishing value for both of us but still be reasonable. I'll offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4200, ""bob_gain"": 5800}

This offer gives Bob a bit more, acknowledging that the money retains more value for him, but still tries to secure a significant amount for me, considering my faster-decreasing valuation. Let's see how Bob responds!"
