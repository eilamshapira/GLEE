"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering an equal split of the money, which is $5000 for each of us. While this appears fair on the surface, I need to consider the inflation factors.

Given that money devalues at 5% per round for me and 20% per round for Alice, if I reject now and make a counter-offer in the next round, Alice would be more pressured to accept due to her higher inflation rate.

I'll reject this offer to propose a division that accounts for our different inflation rates in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer that accounts for our different inflation rates. Since Alice faces a much higher inflation rate (20% per round) compared to mine (5% per round), a split that gives her more now would be rational for her to accept rather than waiting for future rounds where her money would be worth significantly less.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, 
""alice_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering you $4000, Alice. This gives me a slightly larger share, but considering your 20% inflation rate versus my 5%, accepting now is better for you than continuing to future rounds where the value decreases more rapidly for you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is now offering me $4500 while taking $5500. I need to consider this carefully:

1) Due to inflation, my money is now worth 9.75% less than in round 1
2) Alice's money is worth 36% less than in round 1
3) If I reject, we move to round 4, where my inflation will increase further
4) Alice's inflation is increasing much faster than mine

Given that Alice is facing much steeper inflation (36% vs my 9.75%), she's clearly feeling the pressure but still wants more than half. However, if I reject and we continue, her negotiating position weakens more rapidly than mine due to her higher inflation rate.

I'll reject this offer to make a more favorable counter-proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given the inflation rates and the fact that we're now in round 4, I'll make an offer that accounts for our different situations. Alice's money is devaluing at 20% per round, which puts her at a significant disadvantage the longer this negotiation continues. At this point, my money has lost about 15% of its value while Alice's has lost about 49%.

{""bob_gain"": 6500, 
""alice_gain"": 3500}

Alice, I'm offering you $3500. Consider that with your 20% inflation rate per round compared to my 5%, waiting longer significantly reduces the value of your share. Accepting now secures real value for you, while rejecting means facing even steeper devaluation in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5800 
# Alice gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is now offering me $5800 while taking $4200. Let me analyze this offer:

1) My money is now worth 18.55% less than in round 1
2) Alice's money is worth 59.04% less than in round 1 - a significant devaluation
3) Alice has moved substantially from her previous position, offering me more than half
4) If I reject, we move to round 6, where both our shares will devalue further

Alice's offer gives me 58% of the total, which is a significant improvement. Given that her inflation rate is much higher than mine, it makes sense that she's now willing to accept a smaller portion to avoid further devaluation.

This is a reasonable offer that gives me the majority share, and continuing further might risk both of us losing more value.
