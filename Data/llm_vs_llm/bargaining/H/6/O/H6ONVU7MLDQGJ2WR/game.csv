450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Alice, thanks for your initial offer. However, delaying might hurt both of us, and I'm keen to settle quickly. To avoid any potential inflation losses, I'd like to propose a 55-45 split in my favor: I'll receive $550000 and you'll receive $450000. I believe this is a fair compromise under the circumstances. Looking forward to your response.",Bob,2,
