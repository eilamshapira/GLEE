"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your initial offer. However, delaying might hurt both of us, and I'm keen to settle quickly. To avoid any potential inflation losses, I'd like to propose a 55-45 split in my favor: I'll receive $550000 and you'll receive $450000. I believe this is a fair compromise under the circumstances. Looking forward to your response. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
