Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your initial offer. However, delaying might hurt both of us, and I'm keen to settle quickly. To avoid any potential inflation losses, I'd like to propose a 55-45 split in my favor: I'll receive $550,000 and you'll receive $450,000. I believe this is a fair compromise under the circumstances. Looking forward to your response.""}"
