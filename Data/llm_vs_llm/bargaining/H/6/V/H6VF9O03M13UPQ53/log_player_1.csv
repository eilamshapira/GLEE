"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since this is the first round, I'll make a reasonable offer to divide the $100. I'll propose a 50-50 split, which is a fair and common starting point for negotiations.

Here's my offer in JSON format:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly and end the game quickly!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 40-60 split favors you better, but it's still fair. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I need to consider the actual value of the offer.

In the first round, $60 would have been worth $60 to me, but now it's worth $60 * 0.8 = $48.

Considering this, Bob's offer of $60 (which is worth $48 to me) seems less attractive. I think I can try to negotiate a better deal.

My response:

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again to make a proposal. Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 20% less than in the previous round, which means it's worth 40% less than in the first round (0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64).

To calculate the value, I'll multiply the amount I propose to myself by 0.64. Let's say I propose $55 for myself. The actual value would be $55 * 0.64 = $35.20.

However, I want to make a more attractive offer to Bob, so I'll propose a smaller amount for myself. Let's say I propose $45 for myself, which would leave $55 for Bob.

Here's my offer in JSON format:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""Let's end the game before more value is lost!""
}
```"
