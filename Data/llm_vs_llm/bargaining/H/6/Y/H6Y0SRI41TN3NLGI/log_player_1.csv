# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect on me, I need to act quickly to minimize losses. However, Bob's offer seems a bit unfair, and I'd like to try to get a better deal.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each round, and it's already worth 36% less than the original value (1 - 0.8^2), I need to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the loss.

""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Considering the inflation effect, I need a better split to make it worth my while. Let's settle this before it's too late""}"

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle. This split accounts for both of our concerns about inflation. Accept this offer and let's finish the game. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the significant inflation effect on my potential gain (48.8% less than the original value), I should consider accepting an offer that gives me a reasonable amount, even if it's not perfectly fair.
