"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
* I'm being offered $400,000 out of $1,000,000
* If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
* However, due to 10% inflation, any amount I get next round will be worth 10% less
* If I get $500,000 next round, it would only be worth $450,000 to me
* Current offer of $400,000 is not terrible, but I think I can do better even with inflation

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me make a strategic offer:
* Alice's first offer showed she's willing to take a larger share
* I need to balance making an attractive offer with maximizing my gain
* I'll propose a more balanced split, but still giving Alice a bit more to make it appealing
* If she rejects, the next round will have 10% inflation for me, and she might counter with a worse offer

{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000}

This offer gives Alice a better deal than an even split while still improving my position compared to her initial offer. It's fair enough that she should seriously consider accepting it."
