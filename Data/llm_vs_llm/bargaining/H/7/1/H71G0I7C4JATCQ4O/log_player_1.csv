"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer to divide the $1,000,000. Since I need to be mindful that each round makes the money worth 20% less to me, I should make a reasonable first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

I believe this is a fair initial offer that gives Bob a substantial portion while still allowing me to secure a good amount. I'm offering you 45% of the total sum, which is quite reasonable for a first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
