"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering a good split to get this done quickly. Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a split where I get 2000$ and she gets 8000$. This is quite uneven. 

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but I need to consider the 5% inflation per round which means my money will be worth less. However, the split is so uneven that I think it's worth rejecting and making a more balanced counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced offer while acknowledging the inflation effect.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. This is equitable for both of us, and we can avoid further inflation by agreeing now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's try this again. Take this offer, and we both walk away with something. Inflation is hurting us both. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this updated offer. Alice is now offering me $3000 (with a 9.75% inflation penalty), while she takes $7000 (with a 19% inflation penalty).

While this offer is better than her initial one, it's still quite unbalanced. The inflation rates suggest she's being affected more severely than I am, which might explain her willingness to increase my share. However, I think there's room for a more equitable split.

Since I can make a counter-offer next round, and inflation seems to be affecting Alice more than me, I'll reject this offer and propose something more balanced in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""message"": ""Alice, I notice inflation is affecting you more than me. This adjusted split acknowledges that while still being more fair than your previous offers. We're already in round 4 - let's not lose more value to inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Alright, Bob. This is my final offer. I'm giving you a significant amount. Let's end this before we both lose even more. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this new offer considering the increasing inflation effects.

Alice is now offering me $3500, which is worth 18.55% less than in round 1, so effectively about $2851. She would get $6500, which is worth 34.39% less than in round 1, so effectively about $4264 for her.

Given that:
1. The inflation is hitting Alice harder than me (34.39% vs 18.55%)
2. Alice has increased her offer from $3000 to $3500
3. We're already in round 5, with significant value being lost to inflation
4. The effective split considering inflation is now closer to 40/60 than her initial offers

This seems like a reasonable compromise given the circumstances and the accelerating inflation.
