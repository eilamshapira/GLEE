"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because inflation impacts you more severely than me (20% vs 5%), which means we both benefit from agreeing sooner rather than later. If we go to round 2, the money is already worth less to both of us, and the loss compounds with each round. Let's make a deal now that works for both of us.""}"
