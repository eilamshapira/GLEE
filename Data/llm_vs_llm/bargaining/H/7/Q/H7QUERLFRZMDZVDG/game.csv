6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first move. This is a fair offer considering we both want to reach an agreement quickly.",Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"Hi Alice, I think a 55-45 split is more reasonable, considering I'm making a compromise and we both want to reach an agreement before the money loses its value due to inflation.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, since your money is affected by 5% inflation each round, this 55-45 split in my favor actually gives you more real value than my previous offer. Let's be practical and reach an agreement now before inflation reduces your purchasing power further.",Alice,3,

4750.0,5250.0,"Alice, I understand your point about inflation, but I still think your offer is not fair. I'm willing to compromise and meet you closer to the middle. Let's agree on a 52.5-47.5 split. This way, we both get a reasonable share, and I minimize my inflation losses.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5300.0,4700.0,"Bob, let's be rational here. Your money is now worth over 14% less due to inflation, and it will keep decreasing. I'm offering you a 53-47 split, which is more generous than my last offer. If we don't reach an agreement soon, inflation will continue to erode your share's value. This is a fair deal - let's conclude this now.",Alice,5,
