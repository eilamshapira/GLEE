"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think a 55-45 split is more reasonable, considering I'm making a compromise and we both want to reach an agreement before the money loses its value due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer since the value of money for me hasn't decreased, and I can still make a better counter-offer in the next round. Bob's trying to take advantage by asking for more despite their money being worth less due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, since your money is affected by 5% inflation each round, this 55-45 split in my favor actually gives you more real value than my previous offer. Let's be practical and reach an agreement now before inflation reduces your purchasing power further.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your point about inflation, but I still think your offer is not fair. I'm willing to compromise and meet you closer to the middle. Let's agree on a 52.5-47.5 split. This way, we both get a reasonable share, and I minimize my inflation losses. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer. Even though Bob's money is worth about 14% less now, I still have full purchasing power and can make another counter-offer. The fact that Bob's money is losing value should make them more eager to reach a deal, not demand more."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5300,
""bob_gain"": 4700,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be rational here. Your money is now worth over 14% less due to inflation, and it will keep decreasing. I'm offering you a 53-47 split, which is more generous than my last offer. If we don't reach an agreement soon, inflation will continue to erode your share's value. This is a fair deal - let's conclude this now.""}"
