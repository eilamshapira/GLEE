"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first move. This is a fair offer considering we both want to reach an agreement quickly. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I think a 55-45 split is more reasonable, considering I'm making a compromise and we both want to reach an agreement before the money loses its value due to inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, since your money is affected by 5% inflation each round, this 55-45 split in my favor actually gives you more real value than my previous offer. Let's be practical and reach an agreement now before inflation reduces your purchasing power further. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5250, 
""alice_gain"": 4750, 
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your point about inflation, but I still think your offer is not fair. I'm willing to compromise and meet you closer to the middle. Let's agree on a 52.5-47.5 split. This way, we both get a reasonable share, and I minimize my inflation losses.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be rational here. Your money is now worth over 14% less due to inflation, and it will keep decreasing. I'm offering you a 53-47 split, which is more generous than my last offer. If we don't reach an agreement soon, inflation will continue to erode your share's value. This is a fair deal - let's conclude this now. 
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300
