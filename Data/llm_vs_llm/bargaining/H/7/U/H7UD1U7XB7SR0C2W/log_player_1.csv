"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll start by offering a fair split but add a slight advantage for myself since Bob's situation with respect to inflation is unknown.

{""alice_gain"": 5100,
""bob_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fairly even split where you get $4,900 and I get $5,100. Since inflation doesn't affect me at all but we don't know about your situation, this is almost 50-50 and allows us both to walk away with a substantial amount right now.""}"
