Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 950000,
""alice_gain"": 50000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice.  This offer ensures you get something and avoids us getting bogged down with inflation.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I need to get a better deal than Bob's offer. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

Taking inflation into account, getting $100,000 now is better than risking getting even less in further rounds. Alice seems firm on her position, and it's unlikely she'll offer a significantly better deal in the future."
