Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Given that your money is now worth 10% less due to inflation, this 65-35 split actually gives you equivalent value to what you offered me. It's in your best interest to accept now before further devaluation. 
# Bob gain: 35
