"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split so we both win equally! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
1. It's a perfectly equal 50-50 split
2. We're in round 1, so there's no inflation yet
3. $5000 is a significant amount
4. If I reject, the next offer would be subject to 20% inflation, meaning we'd be dividing $8000 instead of $10000
5. This is a fair and reasonable first offer
