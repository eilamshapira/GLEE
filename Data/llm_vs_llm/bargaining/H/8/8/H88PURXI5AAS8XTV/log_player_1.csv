"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm affected by 5% inflation each round while you're not. This is fair and allows us both to walk away with a good amount.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice. Considering that if we continue the game your money will be further eroded by inflation and future rounds lead to you ending up with nothing, I'm proposing a division that secures us both an immediate payoff—with you getting at least something rather than nothing later. Please accept this offer so we can avoid further loss! 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 9999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Bob, your last offer was completely unfair. I'm still willing to be reasonable, but I need a larger share to offset the inflation penalty I face. This 70-30 split is fair considering my disadvantage. If we keep going, I'll need to ask for even more to compensate for inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice. I understand that inflation is eroding the value of the amounts you receive each round—by round 4, every dollar for you is worth about 85.74% of what it was in round 1. While you rejected the previous offer, continuing the game will only worsen that effect for you. To avoid further loss, I’m offering you $7380 (which is effectively about $6330 in round‑1 value for you) and I’ll take $2620. I believe this deal fairly compensates for your inflation penalty while preserving more value for both of us compared to future rounds. Please consider finalizing the split now so we can both walk away with as much as possible. 
# Alice gain: 7380 
# Bob gain: 2620
