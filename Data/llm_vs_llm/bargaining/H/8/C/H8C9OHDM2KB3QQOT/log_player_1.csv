"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2857 
# Bob gain: 7143 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, the value of the money decreases by 20% for me and 10% for Bob each round. 

In round 1, the total value was $10,000.
In round 2, the value for me was $10,000 * 0.8 = $8,000 and for Bob was $10,000 * 0.9 = $9,000.
In round 3, the value for me is $8,000 * 0.8 = $6,400 and for Bob is $9,000 * 0.9 = $8,100.

To make a fair offer, I'll consider the original $10,000 and try to split it in a way that takes into account the decreased value.
