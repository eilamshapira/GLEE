"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 35, ""bob_gain"": 65, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a split: I take $35 and you get $65. Let's agree quickly since every round delays my share's real value. Looking forward to a prompt and fair resolution!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm proposing we split it $70 for me and $30 for you. It's important to reach a fair agreement quickly to avoid further devaluation. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
