"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering inflation, I'll take a bit more. Still a good deal for you. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept this offer, I'll get $40, but it's worth 20% less than the original value. So, the actual value I'll get is $40 * 0.8 = $32.

If I reject this offer, the money will be worth even less in the next round.
