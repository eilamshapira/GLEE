Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice due to the significant and uneven inflation. Here's why:

* **My Loss:** My potential gain is now worth 19% less than in round 1. Delaying further significantly increases this penalty.
* **Alice's Reduced Gain:** Alice's potential gain is suffering a much larger 36% reduction. This makes her offer more appealing than it seems at face value.
* **Uncertainty:** I don't know how Alice perceives the inflation, she might be more desperate to close the deal.

Waiting carries a significant risk with little potential for a better outcome. Accepting cuts my losses and avoids a potentially worse scenario in future rounds."
