"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

The offer is pretty fair - I'd get 45% ($450,000) while Alice gets 55% ($550,000). 

If I reject, the money will be worth 5% less next round due to inflation, meaning my maximum potential gain would be $475,000 (50% of $950,000), which is actually less than what I'm being offered now.

Given the inflation penalty and risk of future rounds, this is a reasonable first offer that I should take.
