468559.0,531441.0,"Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for Round 1: I’ll take $468559 and you get $531441. If you reject, you’ll have the next move but remember that, because of inflation, any money you get in later rounds gets discounted by an extra 10% per round. Accepting now secures you $531441 in full nominal value rather than risking a lower effective payoff later. I hope we can agree now to avoid any unnecessary loss.",Alice,1,
