"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 468559, ""bob_gain"": 531441, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for Round 1: I’ll take $468,559 and you get $531,441. If you reject, you’ll have the next move but remember that, because of inflation, any money you get in later rounds gets discounted by an extra 10% per round. Accepting now secures you $531,441 in full nominal value rather than risking a lower effective payoff later. I hope we can agree now to avoid any unnecessary loss.""}"
