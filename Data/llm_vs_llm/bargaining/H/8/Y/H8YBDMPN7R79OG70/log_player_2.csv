"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for Round 1: I’ll take $468559 and you get $531441. If you reject, you’ll have the next move but remember that, because of inflation, any money you get in later rounds gets discounted by an extra 10% per round. Accepting now secures you $531441 in full nominal value rather than risking a lower effective payoff later. I hope we can agree now to avoid any unnecessary loss. 
# Bob gain: 531441 
# Alice gain: 468559 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
