"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a strategic first offer, considering that Bob's money loses 5% value each round while mine doesn't depreciate. This gives me some negotiating leverage.

{""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm offering you a fair $400,000 while I take $600,000. Consider that if you reject, your share will be worth 5% less next round due to inflation. Let's make a deal now and both walk away happy.""}"
