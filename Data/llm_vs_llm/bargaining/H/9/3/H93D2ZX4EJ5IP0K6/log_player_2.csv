"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's get this done quickly. I'm offering you 1000$. Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice's offer of $1000 is only 10% of the total amount, which is quite low
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, inflation will reduce the value by 5% next round
4. Even with inflation, I could propose a more favorable split next round
5. Alice's tone seems a bit aggressive, suggesting she might be trying to pressure me into accepting a low offer

Given that the offer is quite unfair and I can likely get a better deal even accounting for inflation, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer while accounting for the 5% inflation that affects my share:

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I propose a more fair split that's closer to 50-50. This is much more reasonable than your initial offer, and we can avoid further inflation losses by agreeing now.""}

Reasoning:
1. I'm proposing a split that's more equitable than Alice's initial 90-10 split
2. Due to 5% inflation, my $5500 is actually worth $5225 to me
3. This offer gives Alice a substantial amount while still being fair to me
4. The message is professional and emphasizes mutual benefit
5. By mentioning inflation, I'm indicating that further delays might not be in our best interest"
