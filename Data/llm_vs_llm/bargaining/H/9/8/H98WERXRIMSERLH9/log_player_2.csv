"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering a significant share to ensure we both benefit. Let's end this quickly and happily! 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if this offer is fair for me.

Alice is offering me $2000 out of the $10,000, which means she's keeping $8000 for herself. That's a 20/80 split, which is quite uneven in her favor.

If I reject this offer, I'll get to make a counter-proposal in the next round. This gives me the opportunity to suggest a more balanced division of the funds.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced division that's fair to both of us.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""I'm proposing an equal 50/50 split which is fair to both of us. This way we each get $5000 and can both walk away happy with the outcome.""}"
