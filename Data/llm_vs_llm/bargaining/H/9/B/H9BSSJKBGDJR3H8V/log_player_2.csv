Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should have taken the first offer! 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $35 I would gain is actually worth $35 * 0.64 = $22.40 in real value (since it's 36% less than the original value). 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Due to inflation, the money I gain is worth 36% * 2 = 51.2% less (1 - (1 - 0.36) * (1 - 0.2))  = 48.8% of the original value, for simplicity, I will use 1 - 0.36 * 2 = 1 - 0.72 = 0.28, so the money I gain is worth 28% less in the second round and now 48% less in the 4th round, in the 3rd round it was worth 36% less, now it is worth 48% of the value of the first round, so I will get 52% of the value I propose to myself.
Considering this, I'll make a new offer.
