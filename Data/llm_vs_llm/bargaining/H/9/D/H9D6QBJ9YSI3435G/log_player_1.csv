"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Split it evenly, fair deal?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I need a bit more to account for the inflation I'm experiencing. Let's settle this quickly 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll evaluate the offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, the $45 offered to me is equivalent to $45 / 0.95 = $47.37 in the previous round's value.

As for Bob's offer, he gets $55, but for him, the value is 20% less, so it's $55 / 0.8 = $68.75 in the previous round's value.

Given that the total value is $100, and I'd get approximately $47.37, while Bob would get approximately $68.75 in equivalent value, I think it's not a fair deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer.

Since two rounds have passed, the money I gain is worth 5% less each round, so it's 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025 of the original value. The money Bob gains is worth 20% less each round, so it's 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 of the original value.

To make a fair offer, I'll consider these values. Let's say I offer myself $42, which is equivalent to $42 / 0.9025 = $46.55 in the original value. For Bob, I'll offer $58, which is equivalent to $58 / 0.64 = $90.63 in the original value, but considering the inflation he's experiencing, it might be more acceptable to him.

Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 42, 
""bob_gain"": 58, 
""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's find a middle ground""}"
