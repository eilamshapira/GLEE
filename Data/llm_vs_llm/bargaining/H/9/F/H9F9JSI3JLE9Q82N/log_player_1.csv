"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split considering the inflation pressure affects Bob more than me. Since we both want to reach an agreement quickly, and Bob loses 10% value per round compared to my 5%, I'll offer slightly more to Bob to incentivize quick acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 4800, ""bob_gain"": 5200}

This is a fair offer that gives Bob a slight advantage to encourage acceptance, considering he faces higher inflation pressure."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this carefully:

1. Due to inflation, if I accept now:
   * My $4500 is worth $4500 * 0.95 = $4275 in round 1 terms
   * Bob's $5500 is worth $5500 * 0.90 = $4950 in round 1 terms

2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make a new offer
   * But both our shares will be worth even less
   * There's risk of further negotiations leading to worse outcomes

3. This is actually a reasonable offer considering:
   * The total split is still better than what we'd get after several more rounds of inflation
   * The effective split after inflation is not too far from 50-50
   * We have limited rounds and need to reach agreement
