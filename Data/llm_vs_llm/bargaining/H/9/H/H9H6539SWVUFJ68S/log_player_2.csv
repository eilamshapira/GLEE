"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 310345 
# Alice gain: 689655 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Alice's offer gives me $310,345 and herself $689,655
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 10% inflation, in the next round:
   * $1M will be worth $900K for me
   * $1M will be worth $950K for Alice

While I could try to negotiate for more, I risk losing value due to higher inflation on my side. The current offer gives me about 31% of the total, and any delay will reduce the total value more for me than for Alice.

Given the asymmetric inflation rates working against me, I should probably accept this reasonable offer rather than risk further devaluation.
