"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my first offer to divide the $10,000 with Bob.

Given the inflation rates (10% for me, 5% for Bob), it's important to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. I'll propose a division that accounts for our different inflation rates while being fair enough that Bob might accept it.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this division considering that if we go to further rounds, the total value decreases more sharply for me than for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that we're now in Round 3, and considering the inflation effects (my money is worth 20% less than Round 1, and Bob's is worth 10% less), I'll adjust my offer to make it more attractive to both of us to reach an agreement soon.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}

I'm offering Bob a bit more than my initial proposal, since reaching an agreement now is valuable for both of us due to the increasing inflation effects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","We're now in Round 5, and the inflation is becoming more significant. My money is worth 30% less than in Round 1, and Bob's is worth 19% less. Given this increasing pressure to reach an agreement, I'll adjust my offer further.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an even 50-50 split. This is fair and recognizes that we both lose value with each passing round, though at different rates. I hope Bob will appreciate this balanced approach so we can conclude the negotiation."
