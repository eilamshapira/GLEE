"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60/40 seems reasonable""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn, 55/45 seems more reasonable to me 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same, but Bob's offer gives me less than my initial offer, and considering Bob's gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll reject this offer.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect on Bob's gain, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself while still being reasonable. Since Bob's gain is worth 20% less in Round 2, and now it's Round 3, I assume the inflation effect on Bob's gain will be 40% less (20% more than the previous round, but I don't know the exact inflation rate for Bob). For me, the money is still worth the same.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's adjust the split""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: 50/50, it's only fair considering the inflation hit me harder 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that the money I gain is still worth the same, but Bob's gain is now worth 48.8% less, a 50/50 split actually favors me in terms of real value. Considering this, accepting the offer seems like a good deal for me.
