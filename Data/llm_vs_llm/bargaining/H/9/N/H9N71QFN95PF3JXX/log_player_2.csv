"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400001 
# Alice gain: 599999 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice the offer is $400,001 for me and $599,999 for Alice. This is close to a 40/60 split. I need to consider whether to accept or negotiate further, keeping in mind the 10% inflation penalty per round.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total amount will be worth $900,000. Even if I proposed a 50/50 split then, I'd get $450,000, which is still better than the current $400,001 offer. However, Alice might reject my offer, leading to further depreciation.

I think there's room for a more equitable distribution, so I'll try negotiating.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split that still gives Alice a slight advantage, which hopefully makes it appealing enough to accept rather than continuing to another round with further depreciation.

{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000}

I propose a 45/55 split that gives us both a significant amount while acknowledging that you made the first offer. This way we both come away with more than we would if we continue negotiating and lose more value to inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 439000 
# Alice gain: 561000 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice Alice has improved her offer from the first round. Let's analyze this:

- Original offer: $400,001 for me, $599,999 for Alice
- Current offer: $439,000 for me, $561,000 for Alice

Taking inflation into account, this $439,000 is worth about $355,590 (due to 19% depreciation) compared to first-round dollars. That's less than the original $400,001 offer.

If I reject and go to round 4, we'll face another 10% depreciation (total of about 27% from original). Even if I get a 50/50 split then ($500,000 each), it would be worth about $365,000 in original value.

Since the potential upside is limited and risks further depreciation, I'll accept this offer.
