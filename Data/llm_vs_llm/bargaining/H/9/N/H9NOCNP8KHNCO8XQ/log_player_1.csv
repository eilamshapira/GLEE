"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","For the first round, I'll make a reasonable offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob with each passing round, I'll try to be fair but also consider the decreasing value.

Here's my offer:
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

This offer gives me 55% of the total amount and Bob 45%. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I need to consider the actual value I'd receive.

The original amount I'd get is $520,000, but due to the 20% decrease in value, I'd effectively get:
$520,000 * 0.8 = $416,000

Considering this, Bob's offer seems reasonable, but I'll think about the potential future rounds and the decreasing value of the money.

For now, I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's still a significant amount and the value will continue to decrease with each round.
