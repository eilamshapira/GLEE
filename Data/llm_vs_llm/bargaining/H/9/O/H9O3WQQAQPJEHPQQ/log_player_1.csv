"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob that takes into account the 20% inflation penalty I face with each round.

""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that slightly favors me as the first mover. If you reject this and we go to the next round, I'll lose 20% value due to inflation, meaning I would need to get much more in round 2 just to match what I'm offering myself now. This is a good deal for both of us.""}"
