"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if Alice's offer is fair given the inflation effect. She's offering me 40$ out of 100$, which is less than half. If I reject, I'll make the next offer, but the total value will decrease by 10% for me.

If I reject and we move to the next round, the total pot is worth only 90$ to me. Even if I proposed a better split for myself, Alice might reject it, leading to further rounds and more inflation.

Since 40$ now is better than potentially less later due to inflation, I'll accept this offer.
