4500.0,5500.0,"Since the money depreciates 10% per round for you, we should reach an agreement soon. I'm proposing a fair split that accounts for this reality - you get $4500 now, which is better than waiting and losing value.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5800.0,4200.0,"Counteroffer, slightly lower than initial, still fair",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4300.0,5700.0,"Alice, we're now in round 4, and the value continues to decrease for you with each round. This offer gives you $4300 now, which is better than waiting further. If we keep going back and forth, you'll lose more value due to the 10% depreciation per round. Let's reach an agreement and both benefit.",Bob,4,

5600.0,4400.0,"Still willing to compromise, but need a fairer split",Alice,5,

4400.0,5600.0,"Alice, I appreciate your movement toward compromise. We're now at the halfway point of our negotiation window. I'm meeting you partway by reducing my request - you get $4400 now, the same amount you offered me in the last round. This is fair considering the depreciation effect, and we should reach an agreement soon to avoid the risk of both getting nothing.",Bob,6,
