"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000. This is not an equal split, and I have the advantage in future rounds since the money doesn't lose value for me, while it depreciates by 10% per round for Alice.

If I reject and we move to the next round, I'll have the opportunity to make a counter-offer, and Alice will face a 10% depreciation on whatever amount she eventually receives.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Given the 10% depreciation factor for Alice each round, I'll make an offer that recognizes this reality while still being reasonable enough that she might accept.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Since the money depreciates 10% per round for you, we should reach an agreement soon. I'm proposing a fair split that accounts for this reality - you get $4,500 now, which is better than waiting and losing value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer, slightly lower than initial, still fair 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's new offer carefully. She's offering me $4,200 now, which is slightly better than her first offer of $4,000. However, it's still less than what I proposed.

I should remember that Alice is facing 10% depreciation per round, which compounds to 19% by this round. If we continue to later rounds, her position weakens further. However, we also need to be careful not to run out of rounds, as we both get nothing if we can't agree by round 12.

Given that we're only in round 3 of 12, I still have room to negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5700, 
""alice_gain"": 4300,
""message"": ""Alice, we're now in round 4, and the value continues to decrease for you with each round. This offer gives you $4,300 now, which is better than waiting further. If we keep going back and forth, you'll lose more value due to the 10% depreciation per round. Let's reach an agreement and both benefit.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Still willing to compromise, but need a fairer split 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider the current situation. We're now in round 5 of 12, and Alice is offering me $4,400, which is a slight improvement from her previous offers. However, the value of money continues to decrease for her with each round (now 34.39% less valuable than round 1).

If I reject, we'll move to round 6, where I can make another offer. However, I should be mindful that we're approaching the halfway point of our negotiation window, and continuing to reject offers risks potentially getting nothing if we reach round 12 without agreement.

Given that Alice has shown some willingness to compromise by gradually increasing my share, and considering the time pressure, I'll make a decision:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5600, 
""alice_gain"": 4400,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your movement toward compromise. We're now at the halfway point of our negotiation window. I'm meeting you partway by reducing my request - you get $4,400 now, the same amount you offered me in the last round. This is fair considering the depreciation effect, and we should reach an agreement soon to avoid the risk of both getting nothing.""}"
