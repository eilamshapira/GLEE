"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair division. I'll take 60% and you get 40%. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","While I appreciate Alice starting with an offer rather than demanding all the money, a 60-40 split in her favor doesn't seem particularly fair for an even division. Since this is only the first round and we have multiple rounds to negotiate, I think I can propose a more balanced split.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""I think a 50-50 split is the most fair division. This way we both get an equal share, and we can finish the game now before inflation reduces the total value.""}"
