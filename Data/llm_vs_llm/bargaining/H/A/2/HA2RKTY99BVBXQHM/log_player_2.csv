Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle with a 55-45 split. This is a reasonable compromise, and we're both losing value with each round due to inflation. If we keep going back and forth, we'll both end up with less. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
