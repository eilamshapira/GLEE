"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 0, ""bob_gain"": 10000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob. As you know, every extra round makes the money worth 20% less for me while your money stays at full value. To avoid any delay (and my unavoidable loss) I’m offering you the full $10,000 now. I trust you’ll agree to end the game immediately.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your honesty, Alice. However, I don't think it's fair to take all the money. I'm offering a split that I think is reasonable, considering the inflation factor. Let's end the game here. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
