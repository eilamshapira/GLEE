"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob. As you know, every extra round makes the money worth 20% less for me while your money stays at full value. To avoid any delay (and my unavoidable loss) I’m offering you the full $10000 now. I trust you’ll agree to end the game immediately. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
