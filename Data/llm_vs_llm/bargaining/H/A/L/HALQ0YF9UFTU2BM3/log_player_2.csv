"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me 4000$ and keeping 6000$ for herself
2. If I reject, we move to round 2 where:
   - My money will be worth 5% less
   - Her money will be worth 10% less
   - I get to make the next offer
3. While the split isn't equal (40/60), rejecting means both our shares become less valuable
4. The difference isn't extreme enough to risk value loss through rejection
