"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's start with a more even split. 55-45 in my favor. This acknowledges the inflation but also gives us both a reasonable amount. Let's be efficient and agree now! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer since Bob is asking for more than what I offered him, and I'm already affected by 5% inflation. I'll make a better counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Bob, let's meet in the middle. I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. Remember that inflation is affecting my gains by 5% each round, so this is actually less for me than it appears. We should reach an agreement quickly to avoid further value loss.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm adjusting my offer slightly. 52-48 in my favor. Inflation is hurting both of us, but time is running out. This is a good deal for both of us, considering the circumstances. Let's lock it in. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While it's not ideal, with the mounting inflation (already at 14.26% loss for me) and the risk of further negotiations reducing the real value of my gains, this is a reasonable compromise. The 4800 I get now is worth more than potentially getting a higher nominal amount in later rounds with even more inflation impact."
