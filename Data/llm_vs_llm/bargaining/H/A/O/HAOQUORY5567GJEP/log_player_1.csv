"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to calculate the effective value of Bob's offer for me, considering the 5% inflation.

My initial gain in Round 1 was $600,000. Now the total money is worth 5% less each round.

In round 2, if I accept this offer, my money will be worth 95% of the money in the first round, which is $450,000 * 0.95 = $427,500

So I am losing more money by playing the game. I'll accept this offer.
