"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
* She's offering me $400,000 (40%) and keeping $600,000 (60%)
* This is less than half, but still a substantial amount
* We have 11 more rounds if I reject
* The inflation doesn't affect me, so my money's value won't decrease
* However, if we go all 12 rounds without agreement, we both get nothing
* Alice made a somewhat reasonable first offer, but I think I can get a better deal

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer, but still slightly in my favor since I know inflation doesn't affect me:

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

This offer is more equitable than Alice's first proposal, giving me 55% and her 45%. It's fair enough that she might accept it, while still advantageous for me. If she rejects, we still have 10 rounds to negotiate, but the risk of getting nothing increases."
