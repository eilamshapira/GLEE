55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a slightly higher amount for myself because I face 5% inflation per round while you don't. This is actually a fair split accounting for that disadvantage. If we go multiple rounds, we both lose value.",Alice,1,

48.0,52.0,"Alice, I know that waiting further only hurts your share more due to the 5% inflation penalty. In round 2, your $48 is still worth 95% of its face value, which is better than what you’ll get if we delay. I believe this offer reflects our respective positions fairly. Let's agree now before the value erodes further.",Bob,2,

52.0,48.0,"Bob, I understand your point about inflation, but your offer wasn't quite fair. Since I face 5% inflation per round and you don't, this adjusted offer is more equitable. If we go to round 4, my $52 would be worth only $46.8 to me after inflation, which is less than your last offer. Let's agree now and both benefit.",Alice,3,

55.0,45.0,"Alice, I know the inflation hit keeps getting tougher for you. With today's value, your $55 is worth roughly 55 × 0.8574 ≈ $47.15 – a bit more than what you’d effectively get if we delay further. I genuinely believe that locking in this split now spares us both additional losses. Let's settle and preserve as much value as we can.",Bob,4,
