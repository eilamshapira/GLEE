"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a fair offer to Bob considering the inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a slightly higher amount for myself because I face 5% inflation per round while you don't. This is actually a fair split accounting for that disadvantage. If we go multiple rounds, we both lose value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know that waiting further only hurts your share more due to the 5% inflation penalty. In round 2, your $48 is still worth 95% of its face value, which is better than what you’ll get if we delay. I believe this offer reflects our respective positions fairly. Let's agree now before the value erodes further. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Bob, I understand your point about inflation, but your offer wasn't quite fair. Since I face 5% inflation per round and you don't, this adjusted offer is more equitable. If we go to round 4, my $52 would be worth only $46.8 to me after inflation, which is less than your last offer. Let's agree now and both benefit.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know the inflation hit keeps getting tougher for you. With today's value, your $55 is worth roughly 55 × 0.8574 ≈ $47.15 – a bit more than what you’d effectively get if we delay further. I genuinely believe that locking in this split now spares us both additional losses. Let's settle and preserve as much value as we can. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45
