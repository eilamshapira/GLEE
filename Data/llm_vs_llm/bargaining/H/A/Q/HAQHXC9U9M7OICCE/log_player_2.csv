"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a slightly higher amount for myself because I face 5% inflation per round while you don't. This is actually a fair split accounting for that disadvantage. If we go multiple rounds, we both lose value. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Alice, I know that waiting further only hurts your share more due to the 5% inflation penalty. In round 2, your $48 is still worth 95% of its face value, which is better than what you’ll get if we delay. I believe this offer reflects our respective positions fairly. Let's agree now before the value erodes further.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point about inflation, but your offer wasn't quite fair. Since I face 5% inflation per round and you don't, this adjusted offer is more equitable. If we go to round 4, my $52 would be worth only $46.8 to me after inflation, which is less than your last offer. Let's agree now and both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Alice, I know the inflation hit keeps getting tougher for you. With today's value, your $55 is worth roughly 55 × 0.8574 ≈ $47.15 – a bit more than what you’d effectively get if we delay further. I genuinely believe that locking in this split now spares us both additional losses. Let's settle and preserve as much value as we can.""}"
