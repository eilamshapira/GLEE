Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

This offer is getting worse for me. If I reject, I'll be able to propose in the next round where the difference between my loss to inflation and a potentially better deal might still work out in my favor."

I am increasing my demand slightly hoping Alice will agree to avoid further losses for both of us due to inflation."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

The effects of inflation are becoming too significant. Accepting a slightly unfavorable deal now is better than risking further losses in future rounds."
