"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. This is a reasonable first offer that gives both of us a substantial amount, with a small premium for me as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob has offered an equal 50-50 split, which would normally be very fair. However, due to the 20% inflation penalty, we would each actually receive the equivalent of $4,000 in round 1 value. My previous offer was better for both of us.

Still, considering that further delays will lead to even more value loss (another 20% next round), and that we need to reach an agreement within the round limit, I will accept this offer.
