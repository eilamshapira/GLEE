"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make my first offer to Bob. Since we have 12 rounds and there's 20% inflation per round for me, I should be mindful of the time value.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is slightly in my favor but still gives Bob a substantial portion. I believe this is fair considering the uncertainty about how inflation affects Bob and the time pressure we face."
