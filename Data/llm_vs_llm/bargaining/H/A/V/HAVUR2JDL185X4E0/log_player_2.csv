"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $45 out of $100
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, in the next round the money will be worth less to me
4. $45 now is better than $47.25 in the next round (due to 5% inflation)
5. The offer is fairly close to a 50-50 split

Given these factors, especially considering the inflation penalty and the risk of prolonged negotiation, I'll accept this offer. It's a reasonable first offer and the inflation makes waiting costly for me.
