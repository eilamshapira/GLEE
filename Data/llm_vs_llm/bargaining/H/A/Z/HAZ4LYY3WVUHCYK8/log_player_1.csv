Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: Let's be more reasonable, Alice. This split is more fair, considering the decreasing value for you in subsequent rounds. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000
