"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for the division of $10,000, keeping in mind the potential for inflation in future rounds:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

My reasoning is that this gives me a slight advantage, acknowledging I'm making the first offer. It's also a reasonably fair split, increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting to avoid potential losses due to inflation in later rounds."
