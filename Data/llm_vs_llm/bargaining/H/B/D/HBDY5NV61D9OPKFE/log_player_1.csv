I'm adjusting my offer slightly downwards, as Bob's patience seems to be higher than anticipated. It's a balance between maximizing my gain and ensuring a deal is reached before inflation eats away too much of the value."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.

Bob is unlikely to offer anything better than this. Accepting now avoids further losses due to inflation."
