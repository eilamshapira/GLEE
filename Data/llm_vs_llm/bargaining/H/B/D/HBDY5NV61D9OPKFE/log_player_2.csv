"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me in this round, the effective amount is $100 * 0.9 = $90. For Alice, it's $100 * 0.95 = $95. 

To make a fair offer, I'll consider the original $100 and split it in a way that seems reasonable, given the decreasing value.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Alice's offer, I'll get $35, but its value is reduced by 19% due to inflation, so the effective value for me is $35 * 0.81 = $28.35.

I'll think about whether this is a good deal for me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 28.9% less than in the first round (10% in round 1 + 10% in round 2 + 9.9% in round 3, but for simplicity, let's calculate it as 1 - (0.9 * 0.9 * 0.91) = 0.289), and for Alice, it's 14.26% less (5% in round 1 + 5% in round 2 + 4.76% in round 3, but for simplicity, let's calculate it as 1 - (0.95 * 0.95 * 0.9524) = 0.1426).

Effective amount for me: $100 * 0.711 = $71.1
Effective amount for Alice: $100 * 0.8574 = $85.74

To make a reasonable offer, I'll aim for a split that takes into account the decreasing value.
