Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the difference.  This is a fair offer that allows both of us to walk away with a significant sum. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is a tough decision, as the inflation is starting to bite. However, getting only 40% of the pot is not acceptable to me. I'm hoping Alice will become more reasonable, but I need to be prepared to make significant compromises soon."
