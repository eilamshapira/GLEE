"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we both get a good amount before inflation kicks in. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
1. It's a 50-50 split of $1,000,000
2. This is a completely fair division
3. If I reject, the total amount will decrease by 5% next round
4. Even if I make a more favorable proposal next round, Alice might reject it
5. A guaranteed $500,000 is a very good outcome

Given these considerations, especially that it's a fair split and we avoid any inflation loss, I'll accept the offer.
