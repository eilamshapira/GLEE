Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's stick to the fair split. With each round, we both risk losing more.  We can both benefit from an equal division. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

I need to remain firm. Accepting $5000 now means losing a significant amount to inflation. Bob is banking on my fear of losing everything, but a 50/50 split isn't fair given the circumstances."

Round 5

{
""alice_gain"": 5400,

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the longer we wait, the less money we both get. Let's end this now with an equal split. It's the best solution for us both. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

While not ideal, the effects of inflation are becoming too significant. Accepting $5000 now is better than risking a worse outcome as time runs out."
