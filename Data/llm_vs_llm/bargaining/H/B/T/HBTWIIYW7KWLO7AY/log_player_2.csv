Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 10, ""alice_gain"": 90} 

I'll explain briefly: Since if you reject this round, you’ll be proposing in round 3 but then your dollars lose an extra 20% (and yours lose 10% per round), Alice’s continuation value is about 81 effective dollars (0.9²×100), so to induce immediate acceptance in round 2 her nominal share must be at least 90 (because 0.9×90 = 81). This leaves only 10 for me. Hence, the fair equilibrium proposal in round 2 is to allocate $10 nominal to me and $90 nominal to you."
