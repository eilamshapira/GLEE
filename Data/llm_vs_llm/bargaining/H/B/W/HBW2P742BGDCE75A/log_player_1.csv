Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Let's reason through this:

* **Inflation hurts:**  Every round I delay, the value of the money decreases for me, but not for Bob. 
* **Bob's likely strategy:** Bob likely knows this and will propose increasingly uneven splits in his favor. 
* **Finding a balance:** I need to secure a good amount while there's still time, but also leave enough on the table to make it worthwhile for Bob.

I'm hoping this offer will seem fair enough to Bob to accept, given the time pressure."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is getting worse! However, accepting that offer with such a significant loss in value due to inflation would be a terrible deal for me in the long run. I need to hold out hope that Bob will negotiate more fairly as the deadline approaches."

Round 5

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000} 
```

This is it.  We're getting dangerously close to the deadline. This offer represents a 50/50 split.  It's the fairest I can go while still trying to secure a reasonable amount for myself. It's time for Bob to be reasonable, or we both lose."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I understand time is running out, but this offer is too heavily skewed in Bob's favor. I have to believe he'll become more willing to negotiate a fairer deal as we get closer to the final rounds."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 475000, ""bob_gain"": 525000} 
```

I'm conceding a bit more here, recognizing the urgency of the situation. This offer still gives me a reasonable share while offering Bob slightly more than half. Let's hope he sees this as a sign of good faith and accepts before it's too late for both of us."
