"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice has offered me $450,000 while taking $550,000 for herself. While this isn't an even split, I need to consider:

1. If I reject, we move to round 2 where I can make an offer
2. In round 2, any money Alice gets will be worth 10% less to her
3. We have a limited number of rounds before we both get nothing
4. The money maintains full value for me across rounds

Since I can make a counter-offer next round when Alice's share will be worth less to her, and I maintain full negotiating power, I'll reject this first offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since we're now in round 2, any money Alice receives is worth 10% less to her. I can use this to my advantage. I'll propose a split that gives me a bit more than her initial offer gave me, but still leaves her with a significant amount that, even after the 10% reduction in value to her, would be appealing.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

This offer is essentially a flip of her original offer. For Alice, her $450,000 is now worth $405,000 due to the 10% depreciation. This should be reasonable enough for her to consider accepting, as dragging this out further will only decrease the value of any money she receives. If she rejects, her next offer would need to be even more favorable to me to compensate for the continuing depreciation of value on her end."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $475,000 (worth full value to me)
2. She's taking $525,000 (which is worth only 81% of its value to her, so about $425,250 in effective value for her)
3. If I reject, we go to round 4, where:
   - I can make another offer
   - The money will be worth even less to Alice (29% less than original)
   - I maintain full value

While this offer is better than her first offer ($475k vs $450k), I believe I can get a better deal in the next round when Alice's money will be worth even less to her. The inflation effect is working in my favor, and Alice's bargaining position weakens with each round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since we're in round 4, any money Alice receives is worth 29% less to her. This significantly weakens her bargaining position. Let me propose a split that takes advantage of this situation while still being potentially acceptable to her.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

My reasoning:
1. I get $600,000 (full value to me)
2. Alice gets $400,000 (worth only $284,000 to her due to 29% depreciation)
3. If she rejects, we move to round 5 where her money will be worth even less (39% less)
4. We still have 8 rounds left, but time is more costly for her than for me

This offer increases my share significantly, but still leaves Alice with a substantial amount that she might accept rather than risk further depreciation of value in later rounds. The offer is firm but not so aggressive that it would likely lead to spite-based rejection."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $500,000 (worth full value to me)
2. She's taking $500,000 (which is worth only 65.61% of its value to her, so about $328,050 in effective value for her)
3. If I reject, we go to round 6, where:
   - I can make another offer
   - The money will be worth even less to Alice (about 44% less than original)
   - I maintain full value
4. We still have 7 rounds left

While a 50-50 split might seem fair at first glance, the inflation effect means Alice is already taking a significant hit. However, I need to be careful not to be too greedy - we're almost halfway through our rounds, and there's still the risk of getting nothing if we can't agree.

Given that my position will be even stronger next round, and Alice's money will be worth even less to her, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","We're now in round 6, and Alice's share is worth about 44% less to her. I need to make an offer that's strong enough to take advantage of my position but not so aggressive that she'll definitely reject it. At this point, Alice should be quite motivated to reach an agreement since her money keeps losing value.

{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000}

My reasoning:
1. I get $650,000 (full value to me)
2. Alice gets $350,000 (worth only about $196,000 to her due to 44% depreciation)
3. If she rejects:
   - We move to round 7 where her money will be worth even less
   - We'll have only 6 rounds left
   - The risk of getting nothing increases
4. This offer gives me a better share than before, but still leaves Alice with a significant amount

This offer recognizes my stronger bargaining position while still giving Alice enough incentive to accept rather than risk further depreciation or potential total loss. It's a firm but not extreme position given the circumstances."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 525000 
# Alice gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $525,000 (worth full value to me)
2. She's taking $475,000 (which is worth only 53.14% of its value to her, so about $252,415 in effective value for her)
3. If I reject:
   - We go to round 8 where I can make another offer
   - Money will be worth even less to Alice (about 57% less than original)
   - We'll have 5 rounds left
   - The risk of getting nothing increases

While this offer is better than her previous ones ($525k vs $500k), we're getting into a critical phase of the game. We have only 5 rounds left after this one, and the risk of mutual failure is increasing. 

Given that:
1. This is a reasonable improvement from previous offers
2. The risk of getting nothing is becoming more significant
3. We've already gone through several rounds of negotiation
4. Alice is already taking a significant hit due to inflation

I think it's prudent to accept this offer rather than risk further rounds.
