60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we split it 60-40 in my favor. Given the inflation rates, this seems fair to start with. What do you think?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
50.0,50.0,"Hi Alice, since we both face different inflation rates (yours is higher at 20% vs my 10%), a 50-50 split now is actually favorable to you compared to continuing to negotiate. This is fair and gives us both a substantial amount.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, considering the inflation rates and the fact that my money loses value faster, I think a 55-45 split in my favor is reasonable at this point. Let's settle this round to avoid further loss in value.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
48.0,52.0,"Hi Alice, given that we're now in round 4 and your inflation rate (20% per round) is higher than mine (10% per round), delaying agreement hurts you more than me. At this point, you've lost 36% value while I've lost 19%. A 52-48 split in my favor is actually fair when accounting for our different inflation rates, and we should settle now before we both lose more value.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
50.0,50.0,"Hi Bob, we're now in round 5, and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for both of us, especially for me. Let's agree on a 50-50 split to end this quickly and minimize our losses. What do you say?",Alice,5,
