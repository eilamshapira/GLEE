"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since we both face different inflation rates (yours is higher at 20% vs my 10%), a 50-50 split now is actually favorable to you compared to continuing to negotiate. This is fair and gives us both a substantial amount. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, considering the inflation rates and the fact that my money loses value faster, I think a 55-45 split in my favor is reasonable at this point. Let's settle this round to avoid further loss in value.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, given that we're now in round 4 and your inflation rate (20% per round) is higher than mine (10% per round), delaying agreement hurts you more than me. At this point, you've lost 36% value while I've lost 19%. A 52-48 split in my favor is actually fair when accounting for our different inflation rates, and we should settle now before we both lose more value. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52
