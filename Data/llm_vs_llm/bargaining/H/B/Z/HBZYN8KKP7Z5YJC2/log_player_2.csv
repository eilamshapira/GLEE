"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split it 60-40 in my favor. Given the inflation rates, this seems fair to start with. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider the inflation rates carefully here. If I reject this offer, the money will be worth 10% less to me in the next round, but 20% less to Alice. This gives me slightly more leverage in future negotiations.

However, Alice's initial offer of a 60-40 split is not very favorable to me. I think I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","The money is now worth 10% less to me and 20% less to Alice. I should propose a split that recognizes these different inflation rates while being fair enough that Alice would accept.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, since we both face different inflation rates (yours is higher at 20% vs my 10%), a 50-50 split now is actually favorable to you compared to continuing to negotiate. This is fair and gives us both a substantial amount.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, considering the inflation rates and the fact that my money loses value faster, I think a 55-45 split in my favor is reasonable at this point. Let's settle this round to avoid further loss in value. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. Alice has improved her offer from 60-40 to 55-45 in her favor. 

My considerations:
- The money is currently worth 19% less to me than in round 1
- The money is worth 36% less to Alice than in round 1
- If I reject, the money will be worth even less to both of us in the next round
- Alice's inflation rate is higher than mine, which gives me some negotiating advantage

Alice's offer of 45 to me is better than her initial offer, and considering the ongoing inflation, it might be reasonable to accept rather than continuing to lose value. However, I think I can still get a slightly better deal given our inflation differences.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 52, 
""alice_gain"": 48, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, given that we're now in round 4 and your inflation rate (20% per round) is higher than mine (10% per round), delaying agreement hurts you more than me. At this point, you've lost 36% value while I've lost 19%. A 52-48 split in my favor is actually fair when accounting for our different inflation rates, and we should settle now before we both lose more value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, we're now in round 5, and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for both of us, especially for me. Let's agree on a 50-50 split to end this quickly and minimize our losses. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is now offering a 50-50 split, which is significantly better than her previous offers. Let me consider the situation:

- We're now in round 5, and the money is worth 34.39% less to me than in round 1
- For Alice, it's worth 59.04% less than in round 1
- Her inflation rate (20% per round) continues to be higher than mine (10% per round)
- If we keep negotiating, we both continue to lose value, but she loses it faster

This 50-50 split is a fair offer that recognizes our equal standing in the negotiation while acknowledging the time pressure we're both under. Given the accelerating losses due to inflation, accepting this offer now makes sense.
