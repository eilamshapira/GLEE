"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this... 

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 10% less to me. So even if I could get more money in absolute terms, I need to consider if it would actually be worth more after inflation.

With the current 50-50 split offer:
My gain = $500,000

If I reject and go to next round:
- Money is worth 10% less to me
- Best case scenario would need to significantly exceed $500,000 to make up for the 10% inflation penalty
- Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation

Given the significant inflation penalty and uncertainty of getting a better deal accepted, this seems like a fair initial offer.
