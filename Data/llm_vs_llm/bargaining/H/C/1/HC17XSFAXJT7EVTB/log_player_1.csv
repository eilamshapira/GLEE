"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering inflation affects you more, this split accounts for that while still giving us both a significant amount. Let's settle here to avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the 20% inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, my $450,000 would be worth $360,000 in real value.

I think I can do better. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Due to the 20% inflation in Round 2, and another 20% in this round, the money I gain is now worth 36% less than the original value (20% + 20% - (20% * 20%) = 36%). To account for this, I'll make a more favorable offer to myself.

{""alice_gain"": 580000, 
""bob_gain"": 420000, 
""message"": ""Considering the increasing inflation impact on my share, I need a more significant portion to make it worthwhile. Let's settle before further devaluation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair split considering my share is not affected by inflation. Let's settle here to avoid any further risks and losses for you. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","An even split, but considering the 48.8% devaluation of my share, my $500,000 would be worth approximately $256,000 in real value.

I'm not sure if I can get a better deal, but I'm willing to try.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money I gain being worth 59.84% less than in the first round (48.8% + 20% - (48.8% * 20%) = 59.84%), I need to make a more aggressive offer to myself.

{""alice_gain"": 650000, 
""bob_gain"": 350000, 
""message"": ""Inflation is severely impacting my potential earnings. I need a substantial share to make this deal worthwhile. This is my final reasonable offer.""}"
