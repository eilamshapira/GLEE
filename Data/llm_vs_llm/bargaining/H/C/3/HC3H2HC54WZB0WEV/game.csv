400000.0,600000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm offering a split that works in both our favors given the current round constraints. I propose we divide the $1000000 now with you receiving $600000 and me $400000. By accepting now, you secure a larger share while preventing further rounds in which the total value for me (and thus, our overall deal stability) would decrease by 20% per round due to inflation. I believe this fair and immediate agreement is in both of our best interests. What do you think?",Alice,1,

300000.0,700000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I believe I can get a better deal. Considering the inflation rate, I'm willing to take a larger share now. I propose a 70-30 split in my favor. This way, we both still get a significant amount, and we can conclude the game early, minimizing the impact of inflation on our earnings.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, thanks for your proposal. However, given the inflation discount on my earnings and my upcoming turn to propose, I believe there’s room for an arrangement that’s more favorable for me. I’m therefore rejecting your offer and looking forward to making my counterproposal in the next round.",Alice,2,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"Hi Bob, as we enter round 3, I'm mindful that any further delay reduces my share's real value even more—down to 64% of its round-1 value. To avoid additional losses for both of us, I propose a split where you receive $650000 and I take $350000. This proposal not only acknowledges the inflation impact but also ensures we wrap up the negotiation quickly, preserving as much value as possible for both sides. I believe it’s a fair offer given the circumstances. Looking forward to your thoughts.",Alice,3,

250000.0,750000.0,"Hi Alice, I understand the impact of inflation on our earnings, but I'm willing to take the risk for a better deal. Given that my share's value decreases at a slower rate than yours, I propose a 75-25 split in my favor. This offer still gives you a significant amount, considering the accelerated depreciation of your share. I believe it's a reasonable proposal, and I'm open to concluding the game with this offer.",Bob,4,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your proposal. However, with my share depreciating by nearly 49% already, receiving only $250000 leaves me with far less than what I consider a reasonable share. I believe that, given the inflation effects we're both facing (with yours depreciating less), there's still room for a fairer division that better compensates for the rapid loss in value on my side. I'm therefore rejecting this offer and look forward to crafting a counterproposal in the next round that addresses these concerns.",Alice,4,reject
580000.0,420000.0,"Hi Bob, entering round 5 the stakes are even higher. With the inflation effect, my share is now worth only 40.96% of its original value while yours maintains 65.61%. That means if we agree now, you'll effectively lock in about $420000 × 0.6561 ≈ $275562, whereas my portion will be worth about $580000 × 0.4096 ≈ $237568. I know the split might seem tilted in your favor, but as the rounds progress your advantage grows while my share depreciates even more rapidly. Accepting this offer now prevents a steeper loss of value for both of us in future rounds. I believe this deal is generous enough for you given the circumstances. What do you say?",Alice,5,
