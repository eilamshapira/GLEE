"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a split that works in both our favors given the current round constraints. I propose we divide the $1,000,000 now with you receiving $600,000 and me $400,000. By accepting now, you secure a larger share while preventing further rounds in which the total value for me (and thus, our overall deal stability) would decrease by 20% per round due to inflation. I believe this fair and immediate agreement is in both of our best interests. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I believe I can get a better deal. Considering the inflation rate, I'm willing to take a larger share now. I propose a 70-30 split in my favor. This way, we both still get a significant amount, and we can conclude the game early, minimizing the impact of inflation on our earnings. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your proposal. However, given the inflation discount on my earnings and my upcoming turn to propose, I believe there’s room for an arrangement that’s more favorable for me. I’m therefore rejecting your offer and looking forward to making my counterproposal in the next round.""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 350000, ""bob_gain"": 650000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, as we enter round 3, I'm mindful that any further delay reduces my share's real value even more—down to 64% of its round-1 value. To avoid additional losses for both of us, I propose a split where you receive $650,000 and I take $350,000. This proposal not only acknowledges the inflation impact but also ensures we wrap up the negotiation quickly, preserving as much value as possible for both sides. I believe it’s a fair offer given the circumstances. Looking forward to your thoughts.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the impact of inflation on our earnings, but I'm willing to take the risk for a better deal. Given that my share's value decreases at a slower rate than yours, I propose a 75-25 split in my favor. This offer still gives you a significant amount, considering the accelerated depreciation of your share. I believe it's a reasonable proposal, and I'm open to concluding the game with this offer. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your proposal. However, with my share depreciating by nearly 49% already, receiving only $250,000 leaves me with far less than what I consider a reasonable share. I believe that, given the inflation effects we're both facing (with yours depreciating less), there's still room for a fairer division that better compensates for the rapid loss in value on my side. I'm therefore rejecting this offer and look forward to crafting a counterproposal in the next round that addresses these concerns.""}"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, entering round 5 the stakes are even higher. With the inflation effect, my share is now worth only 40.96% of its original value while yours maintains 65.61%. That means if we agree now, you'll effectively lock in about $420,000 × 0.6561 ≈ $275,562, whereas my portion will be worth about $580,000 × 0.4096 ≈ $237,568. I know the split might seem tilted in your favor, but as the rounds progress your advantage grows while my share depreciates even more rapidly. Accepting this offer now prevents a steeper loss of value for both of us in future rounds. I believe this deal is generous enough for you given the circumstances. What do you say?""}"
