"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering a split that works in both our favors given the current round constraints. I propose we divide the $1000000 now with you receiving $600000 and me $400000. By accepting now, you secure a larger share while preventing further rounds in which the total value for me (and thus, our overall deal stability) would decrease by 20% per round due to inflation. I believe this fair and immediate agreement is in both of our best interests. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 700000, 
""alice_gain"": 300000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I believe I can get a better deal. Considering the inflation rate, I'm willing to take a larger share now. I propose a 70-30 split in my favor. This way, we both still get a significant amount, and we can conclude the game early, minimizing the impact of inflation on our earnings.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, as we enter round 3, I'm mindful that any further delay reduces my share's real value even more—down to 64% of its round-1 value. To avoid additional losses for both of us, I propose a split where you receive $650000 and I take $350000. This proposal not only acknowledges the inflation impact but also ensures we wrap up the negotiation quickly, preserving as much value as possible for both sides. I believe it’s a fair offer given the circumstances. Looking forward to your thoughts. 
# Bob gain: 650000 
# Alice gain: 350000

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 750000, 
""alice_gain"": 250000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand the impact of inflation on our earnings, but I'm willing to take the risk for a better deal. Given that my share's value decreases at a slower rate than yours, I propose a 75-25 split in my favor. This offer still gives you a significant amount, considering the accelerated depreciation of your share. I believe it's a reasonable proposal, and I'm open to concluding the game with this offer.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, entering round 5 the stakes are even higher. With the inflation effect, my share is now worth only 40.96% of its original value while yours maintains 65.61%. That means if we agree now, you'll effectively lock in about $420000 × 0.6561 ≈ $275562, whereas my portion will be worth about $580000 × 0.4096 ≈ $237568. I know the split might seem tilted in your favor, but as the rounds progress your advantage grows while my share depreciates even more rapidly. Accepting this offer now prevents a steeper loss of value for both of us in future rounds. I believe this deal is generous enough for you given the circumstances. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000
