Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you want a more balanced split. I'm willing to compromise from my initial offer. Let's meet in the middle with a 55-45 split in my favor. Remember, with each round, inflation affects your gains more, so this is a favorable deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
