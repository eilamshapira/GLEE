"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making a fair proposal to Bob, considering our different inflation penalties.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an equal split of the $10,000. This seems fair to both of us, and since Bob faces a steeper inflation penalty (20% per round vs. my 5%), accepting this even split now would be beneficial for both of us rather than prolonging negotiations."
