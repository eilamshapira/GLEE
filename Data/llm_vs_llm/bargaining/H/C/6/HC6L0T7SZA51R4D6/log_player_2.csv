"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to think about this offer. Alice is offering a 50-50 split of the $10,000, which gives me $5,000 and her $5,000.

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but the money will be worth 20% less to me (so the total would effectively be worth $8,000 to me). For Alice, it would only be worth 5% less (so $9,500 total value to her).

Given this significant inflation difference, waiting doesn't seem advantageous for me. A fair split now is better than potentially getting a larger percentage of a smaller pie.
