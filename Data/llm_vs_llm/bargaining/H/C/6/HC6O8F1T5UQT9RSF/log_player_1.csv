"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that I have to account for 20% inflation per round on my side while Bob doesn't face any inflation, I should aim for a favorable split in the early rounds. I'll propose a fair but slightly advantageous split for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this split because:
1. It's a reasonable 60-40 split that gives Bob a substantial amount
2. If Bob rejects, my next opportunity will be worth 20% less to me
3. It leaves room for negotiation if needed in future rounds
4. It's fair enough that Bob might accept immediately rather than drag out negotiations"
