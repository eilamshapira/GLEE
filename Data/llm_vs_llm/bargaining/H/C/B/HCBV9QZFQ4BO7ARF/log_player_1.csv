I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This leaves a good amount for Bob, but ensures I get a fair share. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

I'm adjusting my offer slightly. I'm willing to accept a slightly smaller share to avoid further rounds and potential inflation. This offer still gives me a good share, while offering Bob a chance to accept a decent amount, especially considering the inflation factor."
