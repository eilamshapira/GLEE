"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a division that accounts for the fact that my money will be worth less if we delay. Since there's 5% inflation per round for me but not for Bob, I should aim for a favorable first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose this split because it's reasonably favorable to me while still giving Bob a significant portion. If Bob rejects this, any future gains for me will be worth less due to inflation, so I'm offering a fair but advantageous-to-me split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Due to 5% inflation, if I accept $50 now, it's equivalent to $47.50 in round 1 value
2. If I reject and make a new offer in round 3, any amount I get will be worth another 5% less
3. Bob's initial rejection of my 60/40 split suggests they're looking for a more equal division
4. Going to round 3 would weaken my position further due to inflation

Even though $50 is less than my initial proposal, with inflation eating into future gains, it's better to accept now than risk further devaluation.
