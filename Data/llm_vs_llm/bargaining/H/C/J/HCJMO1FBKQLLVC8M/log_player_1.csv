"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given that you face 10% inflation per round, $4000 now is actually worth more to you than $5500 would be in the next round. This is a fair offer considering the time pressure and inflation effects. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
