"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the money with me getting 5500 and you getting 4500. This way, we both get a fair share, considering the impact of inflation on me. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer gives me $4500 and Alice $5500
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. Alice faces 10% inflation per round, while I don't
4. If Alice rejects my counter-offer, her share would be worth 10% less in round 3
5. This means I can likely get a better deal by rejecting and offering something like $6000 for me, $4000 for her
6. Due to inflation, $4000 in round 2 for Alice is actually worth more than $5500 in round 3

Based on this analysis, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a strategic offer that accounts for inflation effects:

{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Given that you face 10% inflation per round, $4000 now is actually worth more to you than $5500 would be in the next round. This is a fair offer considering the time pressure and inflation effects.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. I'll take 4950 and you take 5050. This considers the inflation impact on me and ensures we both get a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 5050 
# Alice gain: 4950 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $5050, which is better than her first offer
2. For Alice, $4950 now is worth about 19% less due to inflation
3. If I reject, we'll go to round 4, where:
   - I can offer again, but
   - Alice will face even more inflation (29%)
   - We're using up rounds (only 12 total)
4. This is actually a reasonable offer that gives me slightly more than half
5. The risk of continued negotiation might not be worth the potential gain
6. We're making progress toward a fair agreement

Given this analysis, I'll accept this offer. It's fair and the risk of further negotiation outweighs the potential benefits.
