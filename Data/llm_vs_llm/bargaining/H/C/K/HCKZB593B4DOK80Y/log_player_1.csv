"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to calculate the value of the money for me, Alice, in this round due to inflation. The original $100 for Alice is now worth 20% less.

Therefore, for me, the $100 is now worth $100 * (1 - 0.20) = $80

The offer is:
*   Alice gain: 45
*   Bob gain: 55

Since I am only concerned with my own well-being, I should calculate the value I get. I will receive 45. Since the total amount I perceive is 80, I should accept the offer.
