"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I propose a fair split where I get slightly more to account for the higher inflation rate I'm facing. This way we both benefit from making a deal now rather than later.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the amount equally. Both of us face devaluation, though at different rates, and the best way to proceed is to share the amount equally before inflation reduces it for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
* If I accept now, I'll get $500,000 Ã— 0.8 = $400,000 (in round 1 value)
* If I reject and propose in the next round, even if I get a larger share, it will be worth 40% less for me
* Additionally, Bob will be less likely to accept a very uneven split in the next round
* A 50-50 split in this round is better than risking further devaluation
