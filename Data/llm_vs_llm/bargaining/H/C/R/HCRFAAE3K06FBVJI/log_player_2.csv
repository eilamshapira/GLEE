"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly and end the game quickly! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. 

Alice is offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair on the surface. However, I should consider the inflation effect. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value will be worth 5% less to me (so the $100 becomes worth $95 from my perspective).

If I accept now, I get $50. If I reject and try to get more in the next round, I'd need to secure more than $52.63 ($50 รท 0.95) to make rejection worthwhile.

Given the equal split offer and the inflation penalty for continuing, I should accept this offer.
