Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's settle now with a fair, immediate agreementâ€”a 50-50 split. Every additional round cuts into my share due to inflation, so agreeing now benefits us both. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
