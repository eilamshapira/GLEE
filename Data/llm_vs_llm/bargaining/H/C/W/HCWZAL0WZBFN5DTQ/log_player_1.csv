"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair offer that takes into account the 5% inflation penalty I face with each round.

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose a 50-50 split which is fair for both of us. This is the most equitable division and allows us both to walk away with a significant amount rather than risking further rounds where my share becomes less valuable due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll adjust my offer considering the inflation effects for both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45}

I see that Bob is also affected by inflation, even more severely than I am. Since we're both losing value with each round, I'm offering a slight adjustment that still gives us both a substantial portion while acknowledging that I'm trying to maximize my outcome. This is still a fair division that respects both our interests while avoiding further rounds of deteriorating value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
