"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a proposal that considers both our interests and the time pressure due to the 10% inflation affecting me each round.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose a slightly favorable split for me, but still quite fair. Given that inflation affects only my portion each round, it makes sense to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. This offer gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging the disadvantage I face with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
