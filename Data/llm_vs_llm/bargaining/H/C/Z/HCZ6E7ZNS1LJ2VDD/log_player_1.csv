Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer was a bit too skewed in your favor. Let's be pragmatic - I propose a 52-48 split in your favor.  This accounts for the inflation disparity while still offering us both a reasonable deal.  
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
