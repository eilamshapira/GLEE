Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer was a bit too skewed in your favor. Let's be pragmatic - I propose a 52-48 split in your favor.  This accounts for the inflation disparity while still offering us both a reasonable deal. ""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This should be fair considering the inflation effects on both sides. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

While not ideal, the effects of inflation are becoming more pronounced with each round. Accepting a 45/55 split now is better than risking an even lower amount in future rounds."
