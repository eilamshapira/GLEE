"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split given the risk of inflation affecting my gains in future rounds. I want to make it attractive enough for Bob to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. This is a reasonable offer that gives me a slight advantage while still being fair enough that Bob should seriously consider accepting rather than risking inflation in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I'll get $4800, but it's worth 10% less due to inflation, so effectively $4320
- If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount will be worth 20% less due to inflation
- To get better than $4320 in the next round, I'd need to propose and get accepted an amount over $5400, which might be hard to achieve
- The inflation penalty is getting worse each round, increasing my risk

Given this analysis, I should accept this offer as it gives me a reasonable amount while avoiding further inflation penalties.
