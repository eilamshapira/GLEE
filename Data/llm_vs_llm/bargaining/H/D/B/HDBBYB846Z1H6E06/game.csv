888890.0,111110.0,"Alice, time is costly. In round 2 your money is worth only 90% of the nominal value, so if you wait until you propose in round 3 you could at best secure an effective 800000. To keep you indifferent (actually giving you a tiny edge), Iâ€™m offering you 888890 nominal and keeping 111110 for myself. Accept this offer now and we both avoid further losses.",Bob,2,
