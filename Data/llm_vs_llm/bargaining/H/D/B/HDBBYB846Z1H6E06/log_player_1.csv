"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, time is costly. In round 2 your money is worth only 90% of the nominal value, so if you wait until you propose in round 3 you could at best secure an effective 800000. To keep you indifferent (actually giving you a tiny edge), Iâ€™m offering you 888890 nominal and keeping 111110 for myself. Accept this offer now and we both avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 888890 
# Bob gain: 111110 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
