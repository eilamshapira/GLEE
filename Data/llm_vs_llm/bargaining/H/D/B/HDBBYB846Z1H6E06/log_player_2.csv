"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 111110, ""alice_gain"": 888890, ""message"": ""Alice, time is costly. In round 2 your money is worth only 90% of the nominal value, so if you wait until you propose in round 3 you could at best secure an effective 800,000. To keep you indifferent (actually giving you a tiny edge), Iâ€™m offering you 888,890 nominal and keeping 111,110 for myself. Accept this offer now and we both avoid further losses.""}"
