"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split, giving me slightly more to account for the inflation that will affect me each round. This is a good starting point for us both. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $40 out of the $100, while she gets $60. She's suggesting that she deserves more to account for inflation, but I know that each round reduces the value by 20% for me.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value for me would be worth 80% of the original amount. So a 50/50 split next round would give me $50 Ã— 0.8 = $40 in effective value. If I demanded more next round, Alice might reject, leading to further inflation for me.

The current offer of $40 is equivalent to what I'd get in a fair split next round after inflation, so it's reasonable.
