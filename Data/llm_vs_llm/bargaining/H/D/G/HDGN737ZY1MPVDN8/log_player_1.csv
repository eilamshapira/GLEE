Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose a 50-50 split which is the fairest division. While I understand you wanted more, I'm the one who definitely faces 10% inflation each round. Let's agree to an equal split now so we both come away with a good outcome. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50
