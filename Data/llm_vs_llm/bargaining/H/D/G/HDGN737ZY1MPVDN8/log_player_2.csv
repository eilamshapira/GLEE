"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split it 60-40. Inflation will hurt us both if we delay. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if this offer is fair for me. Alice is proposing a 60-40 split in her favor. While she's right that inflation will hurt us both if we delay, I'm losing value with each round that passes.

Let me think strategically. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but the total value will be reduced by 10% for me, meaning we'd be dividing 90$ from my perspective. 

Given the inflation penalty and limited rounds, I'll make a counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a fair counter-offer that acknowledges the inflation effect on my side.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I propose a 50-50 split which is the fairest division. While I understand you wanted more, I'm the one who definitely faces 10% inflation each round. Let's agree to an equal split now so we both come away with a good outcome.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to take a bit less, but we need to consider the inflation. A 55-45 split seems fair now. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. Alice has moved from her initial 60-40 split to a 55-45 split in her favor. She's now offering me 45$.

With the inflation information revealed, I can see that Alice is actually facing higher inflation (36%) than I am (19%) at this point. This means delaying is actually worse for her than for me, which gives me some negotiating leverage.

The 45$ I would get now is worth more than what I might get after further rounds of inflation. Given that Alice is facing even steeper inflation, and she's moved toward a more balanced split, I'll accept this offer.
