"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair 50-50 split. Since we both face inflation with each round, it's in our mutual interest to agree quickly. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance. However, I need to account for the 20% inflation penalty I face each round.

If I accept now, I get $50.
If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, even if I ask for more, the money will be worth 20% less to me.

Given the inflation penalty and the risk of getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds, this seems like a reasonable offer.
