"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the game.

Here's my thought process:

*   **Current Value:** The current amount is $1,000,000.
*   **Alice's Offer:** I get $450,000 and Alice gets $550,000.
*   **My Discount:** Money is worth 10% less with each round.
*   **Deadline:** 12 rounds max.

Given that this is the *first* round, and I'm getting a significant portion ($450,000), it's generally a good idea to accept a reasonable offer early. Rejecting means risking a worse offer later, plus the added penalty of the money losing value.

Therefore, I will accept.
