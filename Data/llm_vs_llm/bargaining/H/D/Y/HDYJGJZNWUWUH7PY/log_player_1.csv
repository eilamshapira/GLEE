"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I see Bob's offer.

Since the money I receive is worth the same, and Bob's money is worth 10% less to him, I will **accept** this offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
