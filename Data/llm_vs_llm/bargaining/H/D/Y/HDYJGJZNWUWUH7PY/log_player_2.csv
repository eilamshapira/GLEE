"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate this offer carefully considering the inflation effect.

Alice is offering me 1000$ and keeping 9000$ for herself. If I reject, the total amount will be worth 10% less to me in the next round. Let me consider if I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer.

If I reject, I'll propose in round 2, but the 10,000$ will be worth 9,000$ to me due to inflation. Even if I were to get the entire amount in round 2, it would only be worth 9,000$ to me, which is less than the total value we're dividing now.

Still, 1000$ out of 10,000$ is only 10% of the total, which seems quite unfair. I think I can propose a more equitable split in the next round that would be better for me even accounting for inflation.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair offer that takes into account the inflation effect I'm experiencing while trying to reach a reasonable compromise.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

This is a perfectly equal split of the money. I believe this is fair since we both deserve an equal share of the total amount. This way, we can both walk away with a substantial portion rather than risking further inflation by continuing to negotiate."
