9999.0,1.0,"Hi Bob. Since each new round slices 10% off your share’s value due to inflation, waiting really hurts your payoff. I’m offering you $1 now—it's a tiny amount, but if you hold out until your turn the money will be devalued even further. I think it’s best for both of us to settle here. What do you say?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, I understand the inflation is hurting me. But I believe we can both get a fair share. Let's split the money evenly this round. What do you say?",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
9999.0,1.0,"Bob, consider this: if you reject my offer, you'll get to propose in round 4—but by then, the inflation will have hit your share even harder, and you’re looking at virtually zero value. I’m offering you $1 now, which, while small, is still more than what you can expect if you wait. I believe this is the smartest move for you. Accept and let’s finish this quickly.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, the inflation is really affecting me. However, I think a 60/40 split is the best way forward. I'm still getting a good portion and you still get a significant sum. Let's end this now.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
1000.0,9000.0,"Bob, I understand waiting costs you significantly due to inflation—your money in round 5 is worth about 65.61% of its face value, and if you wait until round 6, that factor drops to roughly 59.05%. By accepting this offer, you get $9000 nominally, which converts to an effective value of about $5904.9 in today’s terms—the same as what you’d expect if you waited, but without further delay. I believe this is a fair deal given the circumstances. Let's settle now for our mutual benefit!",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"Alice, I see that you are trying to take advantage of the inflation. I'm willing to compromise on the split. I still think this is a decent offer for both of us considering the circumstances. Let's take it.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
900.0,9100.0,"Bob, time is really against you now. In Round 7, the money you receive is only worth about 53.14% of its face value—if you wait until Round 8 to propose, you'll effectively end up with around $4783. By accepting this offer, you'll get $9100 nominally, which translates to roughly $4834 in today’s terms—a small but meaningful improvement. Let's avoid further devaluation and settle now.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
2500.0,7500.0,"Alice, I'm starting to think you're not being reasonable. Let's split it 75/25. Take it or leave it.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
998.0,9002.0,"Bob, if you reject this offer and wait until round 10, you'll be in a position to propose a division, but due to further inflation your money will be worth only about 38.74% of its nominal value. In this round, however, your $9002 would translate into roughly $9002 × 0.4305 ≈ $3874.6 in today's terms—essentially matching or even slightly exceeding what you could expect by waiting. I'm offering you just a bit more effective value now to avoid further devaluation. Let's settle now and secure our payoffs.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
2000.0,8000.0,"Alice, this is the last chance. 80/20 split. Take it or I'm walking away with nothing!",Bob,10,
