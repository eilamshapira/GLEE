Since each new round slices 10% off your share’s value due to inflation, waiting really hurts your payoff. I’m offering you $1 now—it's a tiny amount, but if you hold out until your turn the money will be devalued even further. I think it’s best for both of us to settle here. What do you say?""}"

I’m offering you $1 now, which, while small, is still more than what you can expect if you wait. I believe this is the smartest move for you. Accept and let’s finish this quickly.""}"

By accepting this offer, you get $9,000 nominally, which converts to an effective value of about $5,904.9 in today’s terms—the same as what you’d expect if you waited, but without further delay. I believe this is a fair deal given the circumstances. Let's settle now for our mutual benefit!""}"
