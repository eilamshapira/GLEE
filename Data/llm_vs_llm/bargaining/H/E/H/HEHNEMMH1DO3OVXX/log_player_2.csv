"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it evenly, no need to wait 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. 

She's proposing an even 50-50 split ($500,000 each).

With inflation reducing the value by 20% each round for me, if I reject now and make a counter-offer, the total value to me decreases. If I were to propose a better split for myself in round 2, Alice might reject, and we'd continue losing value.

Since we're in round 1 with no inflation yet, $500,000 is still worth the full amount to me. This is a fair offer that avoids the risk of continued negotiations reducing the overall value.
