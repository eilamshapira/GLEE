"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split it 55/45. This is a fair offer given I'm making the initial proposal and inflation is a factor. Let's avoid further losses!

# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, 
""alice_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Considering inflation, I think a 60/40 split is more reasonable, given that the value has already decreased by 10%""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the money is losing value fast. Let's split it 52/48. This is a slight concession on my part from the first round, and more generous given the additional inflation. Accept this offer so we both get something worthwhile! 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
