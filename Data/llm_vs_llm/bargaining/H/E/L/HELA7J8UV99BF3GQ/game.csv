570000.0,430000.0,"Hi Bob, since we both face inflation but yours is higher at 20% vs my 10%, this split is actually fair when accounting for future rounds. If we delay, we both lose value, but you lose more. This gives us both a good outcome without needing to extend the game.",Alice,1,

642860.0,357140.0,"Hi Alice, I’m proposing this offer based on our respective discount rates. If you reject, you'll be the proposer next round but your overall value will drop to 81% of nominal, while my value would drop even further. This division – giving you 642860 and me 357140 – matches the fair equilibrium we’d reach if we continued bargaining. I believe this is the best we can secure now, so please accept.",Bob,2,
