"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer that considers the inflation rates for both of us and aims for a fair split.

{""alice_gain"": 570000, 
""bob_gain"": 430000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, since we both face inflation but yours is higher at 20% vs my 10%, this split is actually fair when accounting for future rounds. If we delay, we both lose value, but you lose more. This gives us both a good outcome without needing to extend the game.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I’m proposing this offer based on our respective discount rates. If you reject, you'll be the proposer next round but your overall value will drop to 81% of nominal, while my value would drop even further. This division – giving you 642860 and me 357140 – matches the fair equilibrium we’d reach if we continued bargaining. I believe this is the best we can secure now, so please accept. 
# Alice gain: 642860 
# Bob gain: 357140 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
