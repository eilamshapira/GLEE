"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, since we both face inflation but yours is higher at 20% vs my 10%, this split is actually fair when accounting for future rounds. If we delay, we both lose value, but you lose more. This gives us both a good outcome without needing to extend the game. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 357140, ""alice_gain"": 642860, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I’m proposing this offer based on our respective discount rates. If you reject, you'll be the proposer next round but your overall value will drop to 81% of nominal, while my value would drop even further. This division – giving you 642,860 and me 357,140 – matches the fair equilibrium we’d reach if we continued bargaining. I believe this is the best we can secure now, so please accept.""}"
