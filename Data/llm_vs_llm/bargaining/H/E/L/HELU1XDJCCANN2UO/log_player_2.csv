{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  While a fair split is tempting, time is valuable to me, and I'd like to settle this quickly.""}

Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your perspective, but let's meet in the middle. This offer considers both our interests. 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to more even, but it's still skewed in her favor, especially considering the inflation working against me. I need to push for a more significant advantage in the next round or two."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic.  The clock is ticking, and every round costs us. This offer secures a good portion for me while still leaving you with something.""}

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to concede some ground, but we need to find a balance that works for both of us. Let's settle this fairly. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, the inflation working against me means her offer is still more beneficial for her in real terms. I need to hold firm and push for a slightly better deal to account for this disadvantage."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6200, ""alice_gain"": 3800, ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. This offer reflects a strong position for me while acknowledging we need to reach an agreement soon.""}

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's split it equally. We've both made concessions, and this is the fairest way to ensure we both walk away with a reasonable amount. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** 

While I was aiming for a slightly better split, it's getting increasingly risky to continue rejecting offers. The equal split, while not ideal, guarantees a reasonable payout considering the inflation working against me. Accepting now avoids the risk of getting nothing if we fail to agree in the remaining rounds."
