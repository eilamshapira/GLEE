"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my first offer to Bob for the division of $10,000.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}

I'm proposing a slightly higher amount for myself since I face 5% inflation with each passing round, while Bob doesn't face any inflation penalty. This is a fair split that acknowledges this asymmetry while still giving Bob a substantial portion."
