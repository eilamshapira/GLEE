"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 2000, ""bob_gain"": 8000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal for Round 1: I'll take $2,000 and you'll get $8,000. Remember, if you wait until the next round your money suffers a 20% devaluation, so accepting today gives you the full value. I believe this is a fair split given the cost of delay for you. What do you say?""}"
