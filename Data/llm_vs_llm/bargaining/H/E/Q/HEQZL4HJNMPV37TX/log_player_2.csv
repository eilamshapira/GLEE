"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal for Round 1: I'll take $2000 and you'll get $8000. Remember, if you wait until the next round your money suffers a 20% devaluation, so accepting today gives you the full value. I believe this is a fair split given the cost of delay for you. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 8000 
# Alice gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
