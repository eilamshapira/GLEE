"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. I will play as Alice, and I need to propose a split of $100, keeping in mind the diminishing value for Bob and me over the rounds.

Here is my offer for Round 1:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

My reasoning:

*   **Initial Offer:** I am starting with a proposal where I get slightly more than Bob. This is based on the assumption that I need to make the first offer enticing enough for him to accept early, considering the value of the money decreases for him each round.
*   **Bob's Perspective:** Bob loses 10% of the money each round. Accepting $40 now is better than potentially receiving less in later rounds due to the diminishing value.
*   **My Perspective:** I propose to give up a significant portion of the money as it has a great risk of being worth nothing after 12 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob rejected my initial offer and has now proposed a split where I receive $70 and he receives $30. Let's analyze this before I make a decision:

*   **Bob's Offer:** Bob is proposing a split of 70/30 in my favor.

Considering my loss each round is 0% and Bob's is 10%:

*   **My Perspective:** $70 now is worth the same as $70 in Round 1. This is a good amount.
*   **Bob's Perspective:** $30 now is worth 10% less to him than it would have been in Round 1. However, getting $30 now is better than risking a further reduced amount (or nothing at all) in subsequent rounds.

Given that I am receiving a substantial portion ($70) and there's no decrease in the worth of the money for me, I will accept Bob's offer.

```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
