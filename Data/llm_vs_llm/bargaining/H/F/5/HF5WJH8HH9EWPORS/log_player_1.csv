"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer to Bob. Given the 10% inflation per round for me, I want to balance a fair division with the need to conclude quickly.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose an equal split where we each get $500,000. This is fair and allows us both to walk away with a significant amount. Since I'm affected by inflation with each round, I believe an equal split now benefits both of us rather than dragging negotiations across multiple rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer. While I'm getting slightly less than the equal split I proposed, the 10% inflation penalty means that delaying further would diminish my share's value. Taking $450,000 now is better than risking further reductions due to inflation in subsequent rounds."
