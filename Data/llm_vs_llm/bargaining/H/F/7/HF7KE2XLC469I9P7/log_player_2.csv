"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice's opening offer gives me 30% ($300,000) and keeps 70% ($700,000) for herself. While this is a substantial amount, I believe I can negotiate for a better split since:

1. We're early in the game (Round 1 of 12)
2. There's no inflation penalty for me to worry about
3. I'll get to make the next offer if I reject

I'll reject this offer to propose a more equitable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split, but still giving Alice a bit more to increase the chances of acceptance:

{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000}

This offer is more equitable than Alice's initial proposal, giving me 45% and Alice 55% of the total amount. This is a reasonable compromise that:
1. Significantly improves my position from the previous offer
2. Still gives Alice a slight advantage to make it attractive
3. Shows good faith in negotiation by not being too aggressive"
