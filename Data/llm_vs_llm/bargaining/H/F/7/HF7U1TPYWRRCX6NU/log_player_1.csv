"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, as we both know the total value decreases by 5% each round, accepting this offer now will save both our gains. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor, ensuring you still receive a substantial amount. Let's lock this deal before further losses accumulate. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{
""decision"": ""accept""
}

I accept Bob's offer because:
1. Due to the 5% inflation penalty, delaying further would reduce the total value
2. A 45-55 split is reasonably fair
3. The difference between this and my initial proposal is not worth the guaranteed loss from another round of inflation"
