"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair split. Let's get this done! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer carefully.

Alice is proposing a split where I get $4000 and she gets $6000. While this would give me a substantial amount, it's not an even split of the $10,000. Since I have the opportunity to make a counter-offer in the next round if I reject, I believe I can propose a more balanced division.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""I believe a 50-50 split is the most fair approach for both of us. We both contribute equally to this decision-making process, so let's divide the money equally as well.""}"
