"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly! I get a bit more to account for potential future inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing I get $4,500 while she gets $5,500. 

If I reject and we move to the next round, I'll be affected by 10% inflation, meaning any amount will be worth 10% less to me. If I propose a 50-50 split ($5,000 each) in the next round, it would actually be worth only $4,500 to me due to inflation.

Given that the $4,500 Alice is offering me now is equivalent to what a ""fair"" $5,000 would be worth to me in the next round (after inflation), and considering the risk that Alice might reject my counter-offer, I should accept this offer.
