"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split while accounting for the risk of inflation if negotiations continue.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and you get $45. This is a reasonable first offer that gives both of us a substantial portion, while giving me a slightly larger share as compensation for the inflation risk I face in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Due to 5% inflation, if I accept $50 now, it's actually worth $47.50 to me
2. If I reject and make a new offer in round 3, any amount I receive will be worth another 5% less
3. There's no guarantee Bob will accept my next offer, which could lead to further rounds and more value loss for me
4. The current offer is fair in nominal terms (50-50 split)
5. Given the inflation penalty I face, waiting longer likely won't result in a better outcome for me
