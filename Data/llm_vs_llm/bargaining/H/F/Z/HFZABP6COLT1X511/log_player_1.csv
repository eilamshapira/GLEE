Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. A 50/50 split is the fairest option.  Anything else just risks us both losing out as inflation eats away at the value. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
