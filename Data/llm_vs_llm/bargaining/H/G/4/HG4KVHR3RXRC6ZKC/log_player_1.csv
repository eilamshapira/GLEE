"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Split it evenly, fair for both""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight advantage for me, but still a significant amount for you. The money is worth less for you in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I need to consider that when making my decision.

To calculate the actual value I would get, I'll multiply the offered amount by 0.95 (1 - 0.05 inflation):

400000 * 0.95 = 380000

Considering this, I think I can do better. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 10% less (5% less in Round 2 and another 5% less in Round 3).

To make a competitive offer, I'll aim to give Bob a bit less than he offered me in Round 2. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""My last reasonable offer, don't let inflation eat away our money""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The inflation is eating away Alice's share, let's finish this before it's too late for her. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","To calculate the actual value I would get, I'll multiply the offered amount by 0.8574 (1 - 0.1426 inflation):

300000 * 0.8574 = 257220

This is a relatively low offer, but I need to consider the rapidly decreasing value of the money I would gain if I reject it and proceed to the next round.

Given the significant disadvantage I'm at due to inflation, I think it's better to accept this offer rather than risking an even lower value in the next round.
