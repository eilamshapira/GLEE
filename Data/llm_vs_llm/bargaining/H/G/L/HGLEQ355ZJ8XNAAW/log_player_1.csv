"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Round 2: Considering the 20% devaluation I just suffered, I think 55/45 is more than fair. Let's settle this before it gets worse for me. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
