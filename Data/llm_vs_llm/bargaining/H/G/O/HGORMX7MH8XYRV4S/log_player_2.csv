"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

If I reject this offer, I can make a counter-proposal in the next round. However, due to inflation:
- The $400,000 offered now would be worth more than what I could get in future rounds (20% loss per round)
- Alice only faces 5% inflation per round, so she's less pressured to accept early

The current offer gives me 40% of the total sum. While I could try to negotiate for more, the steep inflation rate I face (20%) means delaying could leave me worse off even if I get a larger nominal amount.

$400,000 now is better than potentially getting $500,000 next round which would be worth only $400,000 due to my 20% inflation.
