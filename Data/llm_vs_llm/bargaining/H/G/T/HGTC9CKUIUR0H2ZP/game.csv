5500.0,4500.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split that slightly favors me since inflation affects me less. If we delay too long, we both lose significantly due to inflation - you even more than me. This is a reasonable first offer that gives us both a substantial amount.",Alice,1,

4800.0,5200.0,"Alice, I understand your point about inflation, but this split is more fair. My offer gives you a significant amount while also accounting for the fact that I'm also losing money to inflation. Let's not risk further losses - accept this offer.",Bob,2,

5300.0,4700.0,"Bob, I've reduced my demand from the first round. Remember that inflation is hurting you more (10%) than me (5%) with each round. If we keep going back and forth, we'll both lose more, but you'll lose at a faster rate. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges we both need to settle soon.",Alice,3,

4950.0,5050.0,"Alice, we're both losing money quickly. This is a truly fair 50/50 split (adjusted slightly in my favor by 100 for the sake of compromise). Accept this and let's both walk away with a good amount. Think of this as settling sooner rather than later, benefiting us both!",Bob,4,
