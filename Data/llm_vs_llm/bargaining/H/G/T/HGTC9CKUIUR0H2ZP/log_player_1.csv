"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split that slightly favors me since inflation affects me less. If we delay too long, we both lose significantly due to inflation - you even more than me. This is a reasonable first offer that gives us both a substantial amount.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your point about inflation, but this split is more fair. My offer gives you a significant amount while also accounting for the fact that I'm also losing money to inflation. Let's not risk further losses - accept this offer. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5300, ""bob_gain"": 4700, ""message"": ""Bob, I've reduced my demand from the first round. Remember that inflation is hurting you more (10%) than me (5%) with each round. If we keep going back and forth, we'll both lose more, but you'll lose at a faster rate. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges we both need to settle soon.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing money quickly. This is a truly fair 50/50 split (adjusted slightly in my favor by 100 for the sake of compromise). Accept this and let's both walk away with a good amount. Think of this as settling sooner rather than later, benefiting us both! 
# Alice gain: 4950 
# Bob gain: 5050
