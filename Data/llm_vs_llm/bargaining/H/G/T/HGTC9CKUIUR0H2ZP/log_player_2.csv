"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split that slightly favors me since inflation affects me less. If we delay too long, we both lose significantly due to inflation - you even more than me. This is a reasonable first offer that gives us both a substantial amount. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

  ""alice_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your point about inflation, but this split is more fair. My offer gives you a significant amount while also accounting for the fact that I'm also losing money to inflation. Let's not risk further losses - accept this offer.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I've reduced my demand from the first round. Remember that inflation is hurting you more (10%) than me (5%) with each round. If we keep going back and forth, we'll both lose more, but you'll lose at a faster rate. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges we both need to settle soon. 
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300
