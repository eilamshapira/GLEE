"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since my money is worth 20% less, I need to factor that in.

If I accept, my $50 is now worth 80% of its face value, effectively $40. Bob's $50 is worth its full face value.

In the first round, I was offered 60 and rejected it. Now I am offered 50, which is effectively worth 40. I should **reject**.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 3, taking into account the continuing inflation for me:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate.

In the first round, I had 100% value. Now I have 100% - 48.8% = 51.2% value.

If I accept, my $40 is only worth $40 * 0.512 = $20.48 effectively. Bob gets the full $60 value.

Since the offer is even worse than the previous offer (which was effectively worth less), I should **reject**.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 5. I'm still facing inflation, so I need to adjust accordingly. The offer is worse than my offer in round 3, so I will offer less to Bob.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective value for me:

My money is worth 100% - 67.23% = 32.77% of its original value.

If I accept, my $30 is only worth $30 * 0.3277 = $9.831 effectively. Bob gets the full $70 value.

This offer is even worse than the previous offers, so I should **reject**.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 7. The inflation is becoming significant, so I need to adjust accordingly.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective value for me:

My money is worth 100% - 79.03% = 20.97% of its original value.

If I accept, my $20 is only worth $20 * 0.2097 = $4.194 effectively. Bob gets the full $80 value.

This is an extremely bad offer. I should **reject**.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 9. Inflation is really biting now, but I still want to try to get a decent outcome.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 85,
  ""bob_gain"": 15
}
```"
