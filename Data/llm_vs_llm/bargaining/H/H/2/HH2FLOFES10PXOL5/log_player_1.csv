"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me propose a fair split that accounts for potential future inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because:
1. It gives me a slight advantage to compensate for the 10% inflation penalty I'll face if Bob declines
2. It's still reasonably fair to Bob, giving him a substantial portion
3. It's better for both of us to reach an agreement quickly rather than letting inflation erode the total value"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Due to 10% inflation, if I accept now, my $450,000 would be worth effectively $405,000 (450,000 * 0.9)
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount I get will be worth 20% less
3. If Bob rejects my next offer, the value will decrease even further for me
4. $405,000 is still a substantial amount
5. Continuing the negotiation is risky due to the inflation penalty I face

Given these factors, I'll accept this offer.
