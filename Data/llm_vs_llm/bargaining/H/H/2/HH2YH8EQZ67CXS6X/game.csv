10.0,999990.0,"Alice, I understand you aimed for a generous offer last round, but delaying only hurts you given the inflation penalty you face. In this round, if you reject, you'll get even less in value when you’re the proposer later. I'm offering you $10 now – which, even discounted, beats the near‐zero you'd end up with later. Let’s settle this swiftly and avoid further loss.",Bob,2,
