"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"":900000,""bob_gain"":100000,""message"":""I propose we divide the money significantly in my favor. It's a generous offer for Bob to consider!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you aimed for a generous offer last round, but delaying only hurts you given the inflation penalty you face. In this round, if you reject, you'll get even less in value when you’re the proposer later. I'm offering you $10 now – which, even discounted, beats the near‐zero you'd end up with later. Let’s settle this swiftly and avoid further loss. 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 999990 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
