"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we divide the money significantly in my favor. It's a generous offer for Bob to consider! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 999990, ""alice_gain"": 10, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand you aimed for a generous offer last round, but delaying only hurts you given the inflation penalty you face. In this round, if you reject, you'll get even less in value when you’re the proposer later. I'm offering you $10 now – which, even discounted, beats the near‐zero you'd end up with later. Let’s settle this swiftly and avoid further loss.""}"
