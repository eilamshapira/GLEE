"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a division that takes into account the inflation pressure on both players, while trying to be fair. Since I lose value faster (20% vs 10% per round), I should aim for a reasonable first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose giving myself $55 and Bob $45. This is a fair split that slightly favors me but still gives Bob a substantial portion. If Bob rejects this, we'll both lose value in the next round, with me losing more, so this should be attractive enough for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Due to 20% inflation for me, $40 now is worth like $32 in round 1 terms
2. For Bob, $60 with 10% inflation is worth like $54 in round 1 terms

If I reject and make a new offer in round 3:
- Values will deflate further (40% total for me, 30% for Bob)
- Even if I propose a better split, the total value will be significantly less

This offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal, but waiting another round would likely result in even less value for me due to the higher inflation rate I face.
