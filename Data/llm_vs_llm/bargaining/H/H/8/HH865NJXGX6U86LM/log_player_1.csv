"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid risk""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I need a bit more to account for the inflation. Let's settle this quickly before the money loses more value. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same, but Bob's offer gives him more, and considering the inflation effect on Bob, I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's gain is worth 20% less due to inflation in the previous round, and now it's my turn again, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself while still being reasonable. Considering the inflation effect on Bob, I'll give him a bit more than half, but not as much as he offered himself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 48,
  ""bob_gain"": 52,
  ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground before the inflation hurts us both""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is hitting me hard. I need to secure more now, but let's end this before it's too late. 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation hitting Bob's gain significantly (48.8% less than the original value), his offer still seems to favor him in terms of nominal value, even though the actual value to him is decreased. Considering I'm not affected by inflation, I'll reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round or forcing Bob to accept a less favorable deal for himself due to his inflation concerns.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Given that Bob's gain is worth 48.8% less due to inflation, and he's still offering himself more than half in nominal terms, I'll try to make an offer that takes into account the decreasing value of his share. I'll offer him slightly less than before, considering his inflation woes might make him more inclined to accept a deal sooner rather than later.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 51,
  ""bob_gain"": 49,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's settle before it's too late for both of us""
