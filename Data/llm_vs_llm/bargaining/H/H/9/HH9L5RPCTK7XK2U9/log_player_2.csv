"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think this through. Alice is offering me a 50-50 split of the $10,000, which means I would get $5,000. This seems fair on the surface, but I need to consider the inflation factor.

If I reject this offer, I'll make a counter-offer in the next round, but the money will be worth 20% less to me. That means the $10,000 would effectively be worth only $8,000 to me in the next round, and my maximum possible gain would be $8,000.

Since $5,000 now is better than a potential but uncertain amount in the future (where the maximum I could get would be $8,000 if Alice accepts my full demand, which is unlikely), I should accept this fair offer.
