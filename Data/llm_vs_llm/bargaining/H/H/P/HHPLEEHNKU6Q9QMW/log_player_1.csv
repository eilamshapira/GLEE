"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage, and we can both walk away with a fair share before inflation affects the value further. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

In Round 1, I could have gotten $6000 at full value.
Now in Round 2, if I accept $5000, it's worth 20% less due to inflation.
$5000 * 0.8 = $4000 effective value for me

If I reject and we go to Round 3, any amount will be worth even less (another 20% less).
Even if I could get a larger share in Round 3, the inflation would significantly reduce its value.

The current offer gives me $4000 in effective value, which is better than risking another round of 20% inflation.
