"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a reasonable first offer to Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose that I receive $55 and Bob receives $45. This is a fair distribution that gives us both a significant portion of the money, while recognizing that I'd like to secure a slightly better deal as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I notice that Bob seems to be affected more strongly by inflation (20% for him vs. 5% for me per round). Taking this into account, I'll make a more balanced offer.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose a 50-50 split. This is completely fair and gives us both equal shares. Given that inflation is affecting Bob more severely than me, a quick resolution benefits both of us, but especially him."
