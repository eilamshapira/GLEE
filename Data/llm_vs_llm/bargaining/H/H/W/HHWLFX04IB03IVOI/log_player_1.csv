"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split that gives a slight advantage to Bob to encourage acceptance, avoiding the 20% inflation penalty.

{""alice_gain"": 4800, ""bob_gain"": 5200}

I offer $4,800 for myself and $5,200 for Bob. This is a reasonable split that gives Bob a small incentive to accept while still being fair to both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me evaluate this offer:
- Due to 20% inflation, $4500 is now worth $3600 in round 1 terms
- This is significantly less than my initial fair offer
- Accepting now would give me less value than my original proposal
- We still have 10 rounds left, so there's room for negotiation
- However, further delays will lead to more value loss for both of us

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer as it gives me significantly less value than my initial fair proposal when accounting for inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since we're now in round 3, the money is worth 40% less than in round 1. We need to be more pragmatic to reach an agreement before losing too much value.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose a completely equal 50-50 split. This is a fair and balanced offer that shows I'm willing to compromise. With the 40% inflation factor, we both need to reach an agreement soon or we'll both lose significant value. This split gives us both $5000, which after inflation is equivalent to $3000 in round 1 terms."
