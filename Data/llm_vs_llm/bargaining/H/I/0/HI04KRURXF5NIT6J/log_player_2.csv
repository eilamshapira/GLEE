"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the effective amount is $80. I'll make an offer to divide this amount.

{""bob_gain"": 45, 
""alice_gain"": 55}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I were to gain $35, it would be worth approximately $35 * 0.64 = $22.40 in the original value (since it's 36% less).
