Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

Explanation: I start by offering a 60-40 split in my favor. This gives Bob a reasonable amount while securing a larger share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

Explanation: I'll offer a 55-45 split in my favor. This is a bit more generous to Bob than my initial offer, considering the effects of inflation."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

Explanation: To accommodate the increasing impact of inflation and to find a middle ground, I'll propose an even 50-50 split. This should be fair and more likely to be accepted by Bob."
