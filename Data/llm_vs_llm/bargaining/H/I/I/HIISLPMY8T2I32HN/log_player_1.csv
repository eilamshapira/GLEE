"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering we both want to avoid the 5% inflation penalty on future rounds.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's make it an even split. It's better for both of us to avoid inflation impacts. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The reasoning is:
1. Due to 5% inflation, if I reject this offer, any money I get in the next round will be worth less
2. A 5000$ offer now is worth more than a 5250$ offer in the next round (which would be needed just to break even with inflation)
3. The 50-50 split is fair and reasonable
4. Prolonging negotiations would likely lead to worse outcomes for both parties due to inflation"
