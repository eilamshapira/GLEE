"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze Alice's offer:

Alice is offering a 60-40 split where she gets $6,000 and I get $4,000. This isn't an even split, but I need to consider the inflation factor. If I reject and we go to another round, the total value will decrease by 20% to $8,000 total.

If I make a counter-offer in the next round, even if I propose a 50-50 split, we'd each get $4,000. This means I wouldn't gain anything by rejecting, and Alice would lose $2,000 due to inflation.

Given that waiting will reduce the total pot and I wouldn't likely get more than $4,000 in the next round, I should accept this offer.
