55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we split the $100 into $55 for me and $45 for you. Since with each round my share loses 5% in value, it's in both our interests to agree now and secure a fair deal. I believe this split acknowledges the early value and is a good starting point for our negotiation. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",Alice,1,

50.0,50.0,"Hi Alice, thanks for your initial offer. I understand we both face time pressure with inflation affecting our potential gains. Since we're both equal participants in this game, I propose a fair 50-50 split where we each get $50. This is the most equitable solution and allows us both to walk away with a good result without risking further inflation losses. I hope you'll agree this is fair and we can conclude our negotiation now.",Bob,2,
