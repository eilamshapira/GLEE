"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split the $100 into $55 for me and $45 for you. Since with each round my share loses 5% in value, it's in both our interests to agree now and secure a fair deal. I believe this split acknowledges the early value and is a good starting point for our negotiation. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your initial offer. I understand we both face time pressure with inflation affecting our potential gains. Since we're both equal participants in this game, I propose a fair 50-50 split where we each get $50. This is the most equitable solution and allows us both to walk away with a good result without risking further inflation losses. I hope you'll agree this is fair and we can conclude our negotiation now. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
