"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the $100 into $55 for me and $45 for you. Since with each round my share loses 5% in value, it's in both our interests to agree now and secure a fair deal. I believe this split acknowledges the early value and is a good starting point for our negotiation. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $45 while she takes $55. With 5% inflation per round for me, delaying would reduce the value of my potential share. If I reject now and propose in the next round, Alice could also reject, and we'd lose more value with each passing round.

Given that we have 12 rounds total and my money loses 5% value each round, it might be better to secure a reasonable amount now rather than risk getting less later if negotiations drag on.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split since we both face the time pressure of inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your initial offer. I understand we both face time pressure with inflation affecting our potential gains. Since we're both equal participants in this game, I propose a fair 50-50 split where we each get $50. This is the most equitable solution and allows us both to walk away with a good result without risking further inflation losses. I hope you'll agree this is fair and we can conclude our negotiation now.""}"
