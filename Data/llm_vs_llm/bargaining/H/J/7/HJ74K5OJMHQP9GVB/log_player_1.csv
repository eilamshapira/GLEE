"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55-45 is a fair split, considering the first offer was too biased and the money will lose value if we keep negotiating. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer because:
1. Due to inflation, delaying further would reduce the real value of any future gains
2. A 45-55 split is reasonably fair
3. The difference between this and my initial proposal isn't large enough to justify another round of negotiation and value loss"
