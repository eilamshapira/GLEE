"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split that slightly favors me since I'm making the first offer, but is still attractive enough for Bob to accept rather than risk inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split where I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. This is reasonably fair and considering the 5% inflation penalty per round, Bob should seriously consider accepting it rather than waiting for the next round where both of us would lose value."
