"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a simple division. I take 70, you take 30. Fair enough? 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer seems quite skewed in her favor. She's suggesting taking 70% of the total amount while offering me only 30%, which doesn't seem particularly fair for an equal division.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I think a 50-50 split is the fairest approach since we're in equal positions in this game. This way we both benefit equally.""}"
