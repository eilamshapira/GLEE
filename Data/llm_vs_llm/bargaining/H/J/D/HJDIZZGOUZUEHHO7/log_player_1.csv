"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the value of the money has decreased due to inflation, I need to consider that.

My value of $450,000 is now worth 20% less. So, I can calculate the effective value: $450,000 * (1 - 0.20) = $360,000

My decision:
{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 3. Remember, my money is worth 20% less than the original value, and Bob's is worth 10% less:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective value of the money, considering inflation:

*   **Alice:** $420,000 * (1 - 0.488) = $215,040 (approximately)

Since my share is worth only $215,040 in terms of original value, which is significantly less than what I could gain in the earlier rounds, it would be better to reject the offer.

My decision:
{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Alright, here's my offer for Round 5. The effects of inflation are really starting to bite, so I need to make sure I secure a decent amount of value now.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000
}
```"
