"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's make a fair split considering that my money loses value each round. I offer you 4000$ which is a good deal since you don't lose value over time.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concern about the value loss over time. However, I need to consider my own interests as well. Let's settle for this offer, which gives us both a fair share considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The reason I accept is that with 10% inflation per round, if I wait longer my purchasing power will decrease further. Getting $4500 now (worth 90% of original value = $4050 in round 1 terms) is better than risking getting even less effective value in later rounds. Additionally, since Bob doesn't face inflation pressure, he has less incentive to compromise in later rounds."
