"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get a substantial amount right away without risking inflation losses. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's offer considering the inflation effect on my share.

If I reject and counter in the next round, the money will be worth 5% less to me. If we go through multiple rounds, my potential gain could decrease significantly due to inflation.

Alice is offering me $400,000, which is a substantial amount. If I reject, I could propose a more favorable split next round, but the total value would be reduced by 5% for me.

Given the inflation pressure and the risk of eventually getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds, I think this is a reasonable first offer.
