60.0,40.0,"I suggest a fair 60-40 split in my favor. This is reasonable considering you face higher inflation (10%) than I do (5%) in future rounds, so accepting now is in your best interest.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Considering the inflation difference, I'm willing to take a bit more, but still offer you a significant share. Accept now to minimize your losses.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
58.0,42.0,"I've reduced my share from my initial offer to be more accommodating. With your 10% inflation rate, each round costs you more than it costs me. This 58-42 split is fair and accepting now will maximize your value.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
47.0,53.0,"I'm still willing to compromise, but I won't go below a 53-47 split. With each passing round, your advantage from the inflation difference grows, but I won't give in too quickly.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
56.0,44.0,"Let's be practical here. I've lowered my request again to 56-44. Your money is now worth over 27% less than round 1, while mine only 14%. Each round costs you significantly more than me. This is a fair offer considering our positions.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
48.0,52.0,"I understand the pressure from inflation, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'll make a small concession, but I still believe 52-48 is a reasonable split. Don't push me too far, or we might both end up with nothing.",Bob,6,
