"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I suggest a fair 60-40 split in my favor. This is reasonable considering you face higher inflation (10%) than I do (5%) in future rounds, so accepting now is in your best interest.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation difference, I'm willing to take a bit more, but still offer you a significant share. Accept now to minimize your losses. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The inflation difference between us means I should still get a better share. I'll make a more compelling offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, 
""bob_gain"": 42,
""message"": ""I've reduced my share from my initial offer to be more accommodating. With your 10% inflation rate, each round costs you more than it costs me. This 58-42 split is fair and accepting now will maximize your value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still willing to compromise, but I won't go below a 53-47 split. With each passing round, your advantage from the inflation difference grows, but I won't give in too quickly. 
# Alice gain: 47 
# Bob gain: 53 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The inflation gap is indeed growing, which means each round makes Bob's position weaker. I can still achieve a better split by waiting."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 56, 
""bob_gain"": 44,
""message"": ""Let's be practical here. I've lowered my request again to 56-44. Your money is now worth over 27% less than round 1, while mine only 14%. Each round costs you significantly more than me. This is a fair offer considering our positions.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the pressure from inflation, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'll make a small concession, but I still believe 52-48 is a reasonable split. Don't push me too far, or we might both end up with nothing. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While I could potentially get a better split by continuing, there's also an increasing risk of reaching round 12 without agreement, which would leave us both with nothing. The 48-52 split is reasonable enough given we're already 6 rounds in, and my share has only lost about 23% of its value compared to Bob's 41% loss."
