"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share for both 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if accepting Alice's offer is better than rejecting and making a counter-offer in the next round.

Alice is offering me $45 out of $100, which means she gets $55.

If I reject and go to the next round, I'll face a 20% inflation penalty. This means if I were to propose a different split, the $100 would effectively be worth $80 to me.

Even if I proposed a more favorable split to myself in the next round (say $60 for me, $40 for Alice), inflation would make my $60 worth only $48 in today's value ($60 Ã— 0.8).

Since $45 now is worth more than what I'm likely to gain by rejecting (considering inflation), and the split isn't terribly unfair:
