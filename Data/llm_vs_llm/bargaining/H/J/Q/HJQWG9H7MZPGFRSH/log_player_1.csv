"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the situation with inflation.

My money is worth 10% less than in round 1, so my effective gain is now only worth 90% of the original value.

Given Bob's offer in Round 2:

*   Alice gets $45.
*   Bob gets $55.

I need to decide if I accept this. Considering the inflation, I'm losing value with each round. Although the split isn't ideal, it's the best I could get so far.

Therefore, I will **accept** this offer.
