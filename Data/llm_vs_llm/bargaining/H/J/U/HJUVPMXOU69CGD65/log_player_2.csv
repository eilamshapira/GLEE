"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

With 5% inflation per round, if I reject now:
- Next round the $400,000 would be worth $380,000 to me
- If negotiations drag on, the value could decrease significantly
- We only have 12 rounds total before we both get nothing

While $400,000 is less than half, it's still a substantial amount. Given the inflation pressure and the risk of getting nothing if we can't agree, I'll accept this offer.
