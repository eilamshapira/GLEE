60.0,40.0,I suggest a fair split where I get $60 and you get $40. This is reasonable considering the 20% inflation penalty you face in later rounds. Let's settle this now and both walk away with a good deal.,Alice,1,

50.0,50.0,"Let's split it evenly at $50 each. Given the inflation affecting my share, this is a fair compromise. We both get a good deal now before the value decreases further for me.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
65.0,35.0,"Bob, since you're facing 40% total inflation penalty if we continue to round 4, accepting $35 now is better than $50 later. This split is actually favorable to you considering the decreasing value you face. Let's conclude this now.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
60.0,40.0,"Alice, considering the inflation penalty I'm facing, which is now at 48% less value than in round 1, I propose $40 for me and $60 for you. This is a better deal for me than your last offer, and it's still a good deal for you. Let's end this now before my share loses even more value.",Bob,4,
