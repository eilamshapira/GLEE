Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly at $50 each. Given the inflation affecting my share, this is a fair compromise. We both get a good deal now before the value decreases further for me.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the inflation penalty I'm facing, which is now at 48% less value than in round 1, I propose $40 for me and $60 for you. This is a better deal for me than your last offer, and it's still a good deal for you. Let's end this now before my share loses even more value.

# Bob gain: 40
