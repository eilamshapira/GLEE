"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a fair split where I get $60 and you get $40. This is reasonable considering the 20% inflation penalty you face in later rounds. Let's settle this now and both walk away with a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly at $50 each. Given the inflation affecting my share, this is a fair compromise. We both get a good deal now before the value decreases further for me.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, since you're facing 40% total inflation penalty if we continue to round 4, accepting $35 now is better than $50 later. This split is actually favorable to you considering the decreasing value you face. Let's conclude this now. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""Alice, considering the inflation penalty I'm facing, which is now at 48% less value than in round 1, I propose $40 for me and $60 for you. This is a better deal for me than your last offer, and it's still a good deal for you. Let's end this now before my share loses even more value.""
