"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the inflation. The money I receive is now worth less.

Given the information:

*   **Alice's gain:** $45 (but worth less due to inflation)

Before making a decision, let's think step by step:

*   The money's value for me decreased due to inflation
*   I was expecting $60 in the first round but received $45
*   If I reject, I can offer something better in the next round.

However, I do not know how inflation impacts Bob.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, it's Round 3. The value of money is further diminished for me.

Here's my offer, considering inflation:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, it's Round 4. Inflation is taking its toll. The offer from Bob:

*   **Alice's gain:** $50 (but worth less due to inflation)

Let's think:

*   My initial offer was $60 for me.
*   Now I have been offered $50.
*   It's not the best, but it's better than nothing and the money loses value every round.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
