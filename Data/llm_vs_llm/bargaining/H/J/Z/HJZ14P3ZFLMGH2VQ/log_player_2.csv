"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the money 60-40 in my favor. This way, we both get a significant amount, and we can end the game early to avoid inflation affecting our shares too much. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. If I reject, the money will be worth 20% less to me next round
2. I could counter-offer, but Alice's money only devalues 10% per round
3. Current offer gives me $400,000
4. If I reject, my $400,000 counter-offer would only be worth $320,000 to me
5. A better split might not be accepted by Alice, risking further devaluation

The offer is not ideal, but considering the asymmetric inflation rates and the risk of further rounds, it's actually a reasonable opening offer. Getting $400,000 now is better than risking a prolonged negotiation where my purchasing power decreases faster than Alice's.
