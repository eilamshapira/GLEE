600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Since we both face inflation with each round, it's in our mutual interest to reach an agreement quickly. This offer gives you a substantial $400000 while acknowledging my position as the first mover.",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Let's split it fairly, considering we both want to avoid inflation. My offer gives us both a significant amount, and it's more balanced than the previous one.",Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I understand your desire for a more balanced split. I'm meeting you halfway between our previous offers. With each round, inflation cuts 10% of my value, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement now. This 55-45 split is fair and gives you a significant $450000 while acknowledging we both need to compromise.",Alice,3,

400000.0,600000.0,"Considering the inflation affecting your value, I'm willing to give you a substantial amount. However, I believe my contribution warrants a larger share. This offer reflects a more realistic split, given the current circumstances.",Bob,4,

525000.0,475000.0,"Bob, I've moved closer to your position again. The inflation has already reduced my potential gain by over 30%, and will continue to worsen with each round. This 52.5-47.5 split is very fair considering our circumstances. Let's conclude this negotiation now - further delays will only reduce the total value we both receive from this arrangement.",Alice,5,
