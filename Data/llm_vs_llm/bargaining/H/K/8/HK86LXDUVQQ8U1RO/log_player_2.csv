Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer seems worse than before, it's important to consider the decreasing value of the money. Let's analyze:

* **My Potential Gains:** If I reject this offer and propose a 55/45 split in the next round (and Alice accepts), I would receive 55% of a shrinking pot. Due to inflation, that 55% would be worth even less â€“ a significant loss compared to potentially accepting 40% now.
* **Alice's Perspective:**  Alice's offer suggests she might be feeling the impact of inflation too, though not as severely. Her willingness to take a slightly smaller share than her initial offer could indicate a desire to finalize the deal before the value diminishes further. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my gains, even with inflation. Accepting a slightly less favorable offer now might be better than risking a worse outcome in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}
```

**Reasoning:**

The game has dragged on, and the value of the money is rapidly decreasing.  It's time to make a strong push for a fair deal.  A 50/50 split:

* **Demonstrates Fairness:** It eliminates any potential arguments about greed and shows I'm serious about reaching a resolution.
* **Minimizes Further Losses:**  Delaying further only hurts both of us. Accepting a smaller share now is likely better than risking an even smaller share later.

If Alice rejects this offer, I will need to seriously consider settling for a less favorable outcome in the next round to avoid being left with a pittance."
