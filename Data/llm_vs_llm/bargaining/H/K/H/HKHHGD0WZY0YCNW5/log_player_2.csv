"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to avoid inflation eating into our gains. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $40 while taking $60
2. If I reject, the total value will decrease by 10% to $90 in the next round
3. Even if I propose a more favorable split next round, I need to consider that:
   - My maximum potential gain would be if I propose keeping most of it
   - But Alice might reject, leading to further rounds and more value loss
   - $40 now is better than $45 (50% of $90) in the next round due to inflation

Given that inflation will reduce the value by 10% each round, and there's no guarantee Alice would accept a better offer from me, I think $40 now is a reasonable offer.
