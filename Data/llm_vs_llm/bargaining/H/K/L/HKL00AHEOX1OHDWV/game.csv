650000.0,350000.0,I propose a 65/35 split in my favor. This is a reasonable offer considering the time pressure and the fact that the money loses value for both of us with every round.  Let's close this and secure our earnings.,Alice,1,

475000.0,525000.0,"Let's be more reasonable, a 55/45 split is more fair considering the decreasing value of the money. It's still early, but the value drops significantly with each round, so let's find a mutually beneficial agreement.",Bob,2,

600000.0,400000.0,"I'm coming down to 60/40. This is a serious offer, Bob. Consider the devaluation.  We're losing money by prolonging this. Let's be pragmatic and settle now.",Alice,3,

550000.0,450000.0,"Let's find a compromise. Given the significant devaluation, I'm willing to meet you in the middle with a 55/45 split in your favor. This is a reasonable offer considering the circumstances. It's time to settle before we lose more value.",Bob,4,
