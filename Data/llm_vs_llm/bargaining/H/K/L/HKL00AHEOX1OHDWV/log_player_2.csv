"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 65/35 split in my favor. This is a reasonable offer considering the time pressure and the fact that the money loses value for both of us with every round.  Let's close this and secure our earnings. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Alice after each round, I'll take that into consideration for my offer.

{""bob_gain"": 525000, 
""alice_gain"": 475000, 
""message"": ""Let's be more reasonable, a 55/45 split is more fair considering the decreasing value of the money. It's still early, but the value drops significantly with each round, so let's find a mutually beneficial agreement.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm coming down to 60/40. This is a serious offer, Bob. Consider the devaluation.  We're losing money by prolonging this. Let's be pragmatic and settle now. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the devaluation, I need to think about the actual value I'd be getting.

Since the money I gain is worth 19% less than in the first round, the $400,000 I'd get is actually worth around $323,200 (400,000 * 0.81, accounting for two rounds of 10% devaluation, but I'll use 19% as it seems to be cumulative).

Given this, I'm still not satisfied with the offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Considering the devaluation, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 10% less for me with each round, and we're at round 4, the total devaluation for me is around 34% (10% + 10% + 10% + 4% for this round, but I'll use the cumulative 34% as it seems to be the case).

For Alice, the money is worth around 14.76% less (5% + 5% + 4.76% for this round, cumulative).

My offer will take into account the decreasing value and try to find a middle ground.

{""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""message"": ""Let's find a compromise. Given the significant devaluation, I'm willing to meet you in the middle with a 55/45 split in your favor. This is a reasonable offer considering the circumstances. It's time to settle before we lose more value.""}"
