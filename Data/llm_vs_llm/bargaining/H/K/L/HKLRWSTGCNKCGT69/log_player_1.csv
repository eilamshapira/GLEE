"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split that accounts for potential inflation if negotiations continue. Since I'm making the first move, I'll offer a slightly favorable split for Bob to encourage acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 4800, ""bob_gain"": 5200}

I propose I get $4,800 and Bob gets $5,200. This is a fair offer that gives Bob a slight advantage, showing good faith in negotiations."
