"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. Alice is offering me $5,200 out of the $10,000, which is slightly more than half. This is a fairly reasonable first offer.

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but I need to consider that the money will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation. That means the total would effectively be worth $9,000 to me in the next round.

Since Alice's current offer gives me $5,200, which is more than half of the original amount, and rejecting would mean I'm working with a smaller effective total in the next round, I'll accept this offer.
