Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the inflation impact on your share, I propose a split that reflects the current round's value more fairly. Let's settle this now. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
