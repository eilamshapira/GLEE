"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

My reasoning: I'm aiming for a slightly larger share, anticipating Bob will want a significant amount, and hoping this is reasonable enough to be accepted in the first round to avoid the inflation penalty."
