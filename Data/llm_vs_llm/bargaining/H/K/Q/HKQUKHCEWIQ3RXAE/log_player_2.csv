"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Currently offered: $400,000 for me
2. If I reject, next round I can make a counter-offer
3. However, in the next round:
   * My money will be worth 5% less
   * Alice's money will be worth 10% less
4. This means waiting will reduce the effective value for both of us
5. $400,000 is a substantial amount, though less than half

While I could try to negotiate for more, the inflation penalty makes waiting risky. The current offer gives me 40% of the total, which is reasonable considering the risk of future devaluation.
