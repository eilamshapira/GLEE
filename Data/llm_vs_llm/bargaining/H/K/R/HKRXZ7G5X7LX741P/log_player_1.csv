"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a bit more since the money is worth less for you with each round. Let's settle this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the fact that the money I gain is worth 20% less, I'll calculate the actual value of Bob's offer.

The original amount I would get is $4500, but due to 20% inflation, its value is reduced to $4500 * 0.8 = $3600.

I don't think this is a fair offer, so I'll reject it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each round, and this is the third round, I've already lost 36% of its original value (20% in Round 1 and another 20% of the remaining 80% in Round 2, which is 16%, so 20% + 16% = 36%). 

To calculate the offer, I'll consider the original amount and the reduced value due to inflation. 

Let's assume I offer myself $4200. Due to the 36% reduction in value (20% in the first round and 16% in the second), the actual value I'd get is $4200 * 0.64 = $2688.

For Bob, I'll offer $5800, which retains its full value for him.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 4200, 
""bob_gain"": 5800, 
""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's find a middle ground before it's too late.""}"
