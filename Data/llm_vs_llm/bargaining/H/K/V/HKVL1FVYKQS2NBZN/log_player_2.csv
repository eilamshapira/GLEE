"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I take a bit more considering the inflation risk. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully, considering the inflation effect on my value each round.

Alice is offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000 pot. While this isn't an even split, it's a reasonable starting offer. If I reject and we go to the next round, I'd have to consider that any amount I receive will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation.

If I reject and make a counter-offer, there's no guarantee Alice will accept. If we go through multiple rounds, the inflation penalty could significantly reduce the value of my share.

Given that this is a decent offer on the first round, and considering the inflation risk of prolonged negotiation, I'll accept this offer.
