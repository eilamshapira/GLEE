Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the inflation rates and the current offer, let's calculate the real value of the money for both Bob and Alice.

For Bob:
- The original value of Bob's gain: $4,300
- Inflation effect on Bob: 36% less value
- Real value for Bob: $4,300 * (1 - 0.36) = $4,300 * 0.64 = $2,752

For Alice:
- The original value of Alice's gain: $5,700
- Inflation effect on Alice: 9.75% less value
- Real value for Alice: $5,700 * (1 - 0.0975) = $5,700 * 0.9025 = $5,149.25

Considering the real values, Bob would be getting significantly less than Alice, and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for Bob with each round. It might be strategic to accept this offer to secure some value before it decreases further.
