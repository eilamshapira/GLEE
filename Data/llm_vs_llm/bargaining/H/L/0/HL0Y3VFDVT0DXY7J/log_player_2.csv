"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's start with a fair split that slightly favors me. We both get a good amount, and we avoid losing money to inflation. Deal? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the offer is not extremely unfair and we are in the first round, I'll consider it. However, I'd like to see if I can get a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Now it's my turn to make an offer. Considering the inflation, I want to make a reasonable offer that will convince Alice to accept, but also gives me a slightly better share.

{""bob_gain"": 52, 
""alice_gain"": 48, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, but since I'm taking the risk of inflation, I'll take a bit more. Accept this offer, and we can both walk away with a good amount.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concern about inflation, but my gains are also being devalued. Let's meet in the middle a bit closer than your last offer. How about this? 
# Bob gain: 47 
# Alice gain: 53 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my potential gain is already worth 36% less than in the first round. This is a significant decrease in value. Alice's offer, although not extremely favorable to me, is still relatively close to a 50-50 split. Given the inflation rate, I risk losing even more value if I reject this offer and proceed to the next round.
