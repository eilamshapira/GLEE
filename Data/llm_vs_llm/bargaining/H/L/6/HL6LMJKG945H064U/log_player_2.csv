"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a fair split where I get $55 and you get $45. This is reasonable considering that inflation affects you more than me (20% vs 5%), so it makes sense to reach an agreement quickly. If we delay, we both lose value, but you lose more. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
