"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer doesn't seem fair to me. She's proposing to take 70% of the money while giving me only 30%. Given that we're at the first round and inflation will only decrease the value by 10% next round, I believe I can propose a better split if I reject this.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split that takes into account the 10% inflation that affects me.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an equal 50-50 split of the money. This is fair and equitable for both of us. I believe this offers a good compromise between our interests, especially considering I've already lost some value due to inflation by rejecting the first offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 8750 
# Alice gain: 1250 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Alice is now offering me a much better deal - $8,750 which is 87.5% of the total amount, while she takes only $1,250. Even with the 19% inflation affecting my portion, this is a very favorable offer compared to both her initial offer and my counter-offer.

Let me calculate my effective gain: $8,750 Ã— (1 - 0.19) = $7,087.5

This is significantly better than what I would get from a 50-50 split with further inflation in the next round.
