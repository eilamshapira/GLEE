"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's settle this quickly to avoid any inflation surprises. I propose that I receive $55 and you receive $45. This way, we both secure our shares now and dodge any future losses. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but I think a fair split is the way to go. Let's divide the money equally and we'll both be safe from any future losses. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Bob, I accept your proposal. Splitting the money 50 and 50 works well for meâ€”especially since my share isn't affected by inflation while yours is. Let's proceed with the division.""}"
