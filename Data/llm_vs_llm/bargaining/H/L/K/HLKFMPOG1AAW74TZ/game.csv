480000.0,520000.0,"Alice, to avoid further losses to inflation on my end, I propose we settle now. I offer 520k for me and 480k for you. This split secures immediate settlement and ensures both of us get the maximum real value from the available funds. What do you say?",Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I appreciate the offer, but the split isn't quite favorable for me. Let's meet in the middle to avoid further inflation losses.",Alice,3,

520000.0,480000.0,"Alice, as we enter round 4, I’m increasingly feeling the pinch of inflation—my share is now effectively 15% lower than the original value. To help both of us avoid further losses, I propose a settlement now: I take 480k and you take 520k. This offer gives you a bit more than your previous proposal, ensuring you come out ahead if we settle immediately rather than risk even more inflation in later rounds. Let’s agree on this and secure our gains.",Bob,4,
