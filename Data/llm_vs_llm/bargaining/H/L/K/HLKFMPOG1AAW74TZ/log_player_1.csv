Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, to avoid further losses to inflation on my end, I propose we settle now. I offer 520k for me and 480k for you. This split secures immediate settlement and ensures both of us get the maximum real value from the available funds. What do you say?

# Bob gain: 520000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, as we enter round 4, I’m increasingly feeling the pinch of inflation—my share is now effectively 15% lower than the original value. To help both of us avoid further losses, I propose a settlement now: I take 480k and you take 520k. This offer gives you a bit more than your previous proposal, ensuring you come out ahead if we settle immediately rather than risk even more inflation in later rounds. Let’s agree on this and secure our gains. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has switched positions and is now offering me the larger share. While I could push for more in future rounds, the inflation is eating into the total value. Accepting this offer guarantees a larger sum than my previous proposal and avoids the risk of Bob offering even less in future rounds."
