Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000, ""message"": ""Alice, as we enter round 4, I’m increasingly feeling the pinch of inflation—my share is now effectively 15% lower than the original value. To help both of us avoid further losses, I propose a settlement now: I take 480k and you take 520k. This offer gives you a bit more than your previous proposal, ensuring you come out ahead if we settle immediately rather than risk even more inflation in later rounds. Let’s agree on this and secure our gains.""}"
