"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split in my favor is fair considering the inflation. Let's settle this round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is worse for me than the one I proposed in the previous round. It's worth holding out for a better deal, especially as Bob seems aware of the impact of inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 52,
""bob_gain"": 48,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, let's be realistic. I'll come down slightly to $52, you get $48.  We both lose if this drags on.""
}
```

I am lowering my ask slightly to entice Bob to settle, but still aiming for a slightly favorable outcome for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the inflation, a 52-48 split in my favor seems reasonable. Let's end this before we lose more value. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation by mirroring my previous offer but in his favor. This is unacceptable.  The longer he waits, the more detrimental it is to his position, not mine.  I'm willing to play hardball."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 50,
""bob_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  It's obvious we are just wasting time.  Let's split 50/50 and call it a day."" 
}
```

I am now offering an even split.  This demonstrates my willingness to be fair, and it underscores that Bob is losing potential gains with each refusal. This is likely my best shot at a reasonable agreement."
