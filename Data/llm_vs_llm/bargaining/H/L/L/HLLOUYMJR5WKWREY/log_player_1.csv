"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","For the first round, I'll make a reasonable offer to avoid prolonging the game due to the inflation factor affecting my share. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

This is a fair 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept to avoid the risk of losing value due to inflation in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the inflation rates, my effective gain from Bob's offer would be 80% of $350,000, which is $280,000, while Bob's gain would be 90% of $650,000, which is $585,000.

Considering this, Bob's offer seems quite skewed in his favor. I'd like to negotiate for a better split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that the money I gain is worth 20% less with each round, and we're now in the third round, the effective value of my gain would be 80% * 80% = 64% of the original amount. 

To make a competitive offer while considering the inflation, I'll aim for a split that reflects the diminishing value of my potential gain but still tries to be reasonable for both parties.

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000}

This offer gives me a bit less than half, considering the inflation impact on my share, and gives Bob a majority, hoping he'll find it acceptable to end the game early."
