"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Fair share, let's end quickly""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the 20% inflation, the actual values would be:
Alice gain: 450000 * 0.8 = 360000
Bob gain: 550000 * 0.8 = 440000

Since I initially proposed a 600000-400000 split in my favor, this offer is not as favorable to me. However, I also don't want the value to decrease further.
