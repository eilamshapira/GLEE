"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, a slight edge for me due to proposing first. Accept now and we both win! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the actual amount I'm negotiating over is now $800,000 (1,000,000 * 0.8). For Alice, it's worth 10% less, so $900,000 (1,000,000 * 0.9). However, the nominal amount we're dividing is still $1,000,000.

To make a fair offer considering the value depreciation, I'll aim for a split that reflects our respective depreciations.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: My turn to propose again. Considering the further depreciation, I need slightly more to compensate for the delay. This is a fair offer given the circumstances. Take it! 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Considering the depreciation, the money is now worth 36% less for me (1 - 0.36 = 0.64 of the original value) and 19% less for Alice (1 - 0.19 = 0.81 of the original value) compared to the first round.

Given this, I'll make an offer that takes into account the decreasing value over time and aims for a mutually beneficial split before the value drops further.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The clock is ticking, Bob! This offer takes into account the substantial depreciation we've both experienced. A small increase for me to reflect the added loss and the risk I'm taking in proposing. Accept now for a guaranteed profit! 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given the significant depreciation, where the money is now worth 59.04% less for me and 34.39% less for Alice compared to the first round, I need to make an offer that acknowledges these losses but also encourages Alice to accept before the value drops even further.
