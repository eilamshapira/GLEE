"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm offering you $525000, which is a bit more than half. Let's seal the deal quickly to avoid the impact of inflation. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 525000 
# Alice gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $525,000 (52.5%) vs her $475,000 (47.5%)
2. This is slightly in my favor
3. Inflation doesn't affect me, but affects Alice by 5% per round
4. If I reject, I could propose a more favorable split next round
5. However, Alice might reject my offer, and we could end up in a back-and-forth that reduces her value significantly
6. The offer is fair and gives me the majority share

While I could try to negotiate for more, this is a reasonable first offer that gives me the larger share. The risk of getting a worse deal or running out of rounds isn't worth it.
