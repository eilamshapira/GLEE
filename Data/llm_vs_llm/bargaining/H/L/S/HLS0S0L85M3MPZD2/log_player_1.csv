Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it closer to the middle. 55 for me, 45 for you. It's only been one round, inflation shouldn't be too bad for either of us. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
