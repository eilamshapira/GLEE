"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly down the middle, Bob. 500000 for each of us. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering an even 50-50 split of $500,000 each. While this appears fair on the surface, I need to account for the 5% inflation penalty per round if I reject.

If I reject and propose in round 2, the total value to me would be only worth 95% of the original amount. So even if I managed to get more in absolute terms, I need to weigh that against the guaranteed $500,000 right now.

Given this is a completely fair split with no inflation penalty, I should accept this offer.
