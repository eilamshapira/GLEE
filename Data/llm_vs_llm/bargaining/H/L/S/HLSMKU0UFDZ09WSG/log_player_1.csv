"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to consider that for Bob, the money loses 20% of its value each round. This means he has a strong incentive to accept earlier rather than later. I'll make a fair initial offer that acknowledges this time pressure for him.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. This is a reasonable split considering that if Bob rejects, the $40 would be worth only $32 to him in the next round due to his 20% inflation penalty."
