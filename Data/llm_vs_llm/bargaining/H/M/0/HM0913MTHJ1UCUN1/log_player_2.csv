"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 90/10 split. Take it or leave it! Let's get this done! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

That's a terrible deal for me! I'm sure I can get a much better split if I hold out."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 60/40 split. This ensures we both benefit significantly. Don't be greedy!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Alright Bob, I'm feeling generous. Let's split it 50/50. Fair and square, what do you say? 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

A 50/50 split is a fair deal.  While I was hoping for a bit more, the effects of inflation are starting to become significant. Accepting this offer guarantees me a reasonable share."
