Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every round we wait costs us—your money loses 20% per round and mine 10%. If you reject, you'll propose in Round 3, but even then you can secure roughly 39% of the pie, which due to further discounting would net you about $250K in value. My offer guarantees you a face‐value share of $312K (worth 0.8 × 312K = ~$249.6K right now), so it’s best for both of us to settle now. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 312000 
# Bob gain: 688000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, consider our future prospects. If you reject my offer now in Round 4, you'll be the proposer in Round 5, but even then the unavoidable discounting (10% for me and 20% for you per round) will force you to split the pie roughly as determined by our incentives – about 35.7% for you and 64.3% for me. In today’s terms (with my share discounted by 0.729 and yours by 0.512), that means you’d end up effectively with the same value as you get by accepting my offer now. To avoid further losses from waiting, I propose that I receive $714286 and you get $285714. I believe this division precisely reflects our respective positions, ensuring fairness given the discounting. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 285714 
# Bob gain: 714286

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, if you reject this offer, you'll become the proposer in Round 7. However, due to our per‐round discounting (with my money worth 90% per round and yours 80%), you’d be forced to leave Bob with his continuation value—forcing you to settle for what amounts to an effective value equivalent to 285714 nominal dollars multiplied by your Round 6 discount factor. Accepting my offer now gives you exactly that value without further loss. I'm offering 714286 for me and 285714 for you, which reflects the equilibrium split if we continued bargaining. Let’s conclude this deal now to avoid further depreciation. 
# Alice gain: 285714 
# Bob gain: 714286
