Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 688000, ""alice_gain"": 312000, ""message"": ""Alice, every round we wait costs us—your money loses 20% per round and mine 10%. If you reject, you'll propose in Round 3, but even then you can secure roughly 39% of the pie, which due to further discounting would net you about $250K in value. My offer guarantees you a face‐value share of $312K (worth 0.8 × 312K = ~$249.6K right now), so it’s best for both of us to settle now. What do you say?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my friend, let's be realistic. Accepting your previous offer would have been foolish for both of us. This deal still gives you a decent share and benefits us both more than dragging this out further.

If you reject my offer now in Round 4, you'll be the proposer in Round 5, but even then the unavoidable discounting (10% for me and 20% for you per round) will force you to split the pie roughly as determined by our incentives – about 35.7% for you and 64.3% for me. In today’s terms (with my share discounted by 0.729 and yours by 0.512), that means you’d end up effectively with the same value as you get by accepting my offer now. To avoid further losses from waiting, I propose that I receive $714,286 and you get $285,714. I believe this division precisely reflects our respective positions, ensuring fairness given the discounting. What do you say?""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. It's clear we both want this over with. Take this deal and we both walk away with something substantial. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Alice, while your final offer in Round 5 gives me a nominal $550,000 (which translates to an effective value of about $360,855 for me given the 34.39% discount), if we drag this a bit further, I'll have the advantage as the proposer in the next round. With the further discounting in Round 6 (my effective multiplier dropping to roughly 0.5905 and yours to about 0.3277), I can structure an offer that assures you just the minimal amount you'd get if you were to propose in Round 7. This means I would be able to secure an even higher effective payout than accepting your current offer. To maximize my outcome—and given that the equilibrium in such bargaining games shifts further in my favor when I get to propose—I have to reject your final offer.""}"

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 714286, ""alice_gain"": 285714, ""message"": ""Alice, if you reject this offer, you'll become the proposer in Round 7. However, due to our per‐round discounting (with my money worth 90% per round and yours 80%), you’d be forced to leave Bob with his continuation value—forcing you to settle for what amounts to an effective value equivalent to 285,714 nominal dollars multiplied by your Round 6 discount factor. Accepting my offer now gives you exactly that value without further loss. I'm offering 714,286 for me and 285,714 for you, which reflects the equilibrium split if we continued bargaining. Let’s conclude this deal now to avoid further depreciation.""}"
