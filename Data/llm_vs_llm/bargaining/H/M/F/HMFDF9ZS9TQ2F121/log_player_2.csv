"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 20% inflation, the money will be worth less to me next round
4. $4,000 now is better than $5,000 in the next round (which would be worth $4,000 after 20% inflation)
5. The split is not 50-50, but it's a reasonable offer considering inflation risk
