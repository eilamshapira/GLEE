"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. I need to consider the diminishing value of the money, especially for Bob. To start, I'll make a fairly generous offer to try and secure a quick agreement.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob has offered me $60. Given that the money is worth the same to me as in Round 1, and we only have 12 rounds, I will accept this offer.
