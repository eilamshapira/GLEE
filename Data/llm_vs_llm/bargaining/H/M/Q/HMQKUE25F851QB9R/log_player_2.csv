"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is clearly unfair, giving me only 10% of the total amount. Now it's my turn to make a counter-proposal in the next round, keeping in mind that the money will be worth 20% less to me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I propose a fair 50-50 split. This is the most equitable solution, and considering that the money loses 20% value for me each round, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. A 50-50 split is a standard of fairness that should be acceptable to both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

While Alice has increased her offer from $1000 to $2000, it's still only 20% of the total amount, which is not fair. Even with the 36% inflation penalty on my end, I believe we can reach a better deal. I'll make a new proposal in the next round, though I need to be mindful that the inflation penalty will increase to 48.8% for me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor to compensate for the inflation penalty I'm facing. Since the money is worth 48.8% less to me in this round, this split helps offset my losses while still giving Alice a substantial portion. It's a reasonable compromise that acknowledges both the time pressure and the asymmetric inflation effects we're dealing with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Although Alice has increased her offer to $3000, with the 59.04% inflation penalty, this would only be worth about $1229 in real value to me. While I need to be careful about the increasing inflation penalty (it will be 67.23% next round), I believe we can still reach a better agreement. Alice seems to be gradually increasing her offers, but we need to move faster to reach a fair deal before the inflation erodes too much value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000}

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor. With the 67.23% inflation penalty I'll face this round, my $7000 will actually be worth about $2294 in real value to me, while Alice's $3000 retains its full value. This offer attempts to balance the severe inflation penalty I'm facing while still giving Alice a meaningful portion. We need to reach an agreement soon, as the inflation penalties are becoming very severe for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. With the 73.79% inflation penalty, my $4000 will be worth about $1048 in real value. If I reject and continue negotiating, the inflation penalty will become even more severe (reaching 79% next round), which would likely result in an even worse outcome for me. Alice has shown a pattern of gradually increasing offers, but waiting longer would erode too much value from my share. This isn't an ideal split, but it's the best practical outcome given the circumstances."
