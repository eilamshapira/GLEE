285714.0,714286.0,"Alice, given that every round further erodes our money – 10% for me and 20% for you – I propose a split that reflects our differing time‐values. If you accept now, you get $285714 (worth 0.8× that amount in your eyes), which is exactly what you’d expect if you waited for your turn later. I believe this is a fair offer under the circumstances; please accept.",Bob,2,

525000.0,475000.0,"Alice, notice that with each round our dollars lose value – at this round, my dollars are worth 72.9% of their face value and yours only 51.2%. Waiting another round will only hurt you more. By accepting this proposal, you secure 525000 nominal dollars, which in your eyes is 525000 × 0.512 ≈ 268800 in round‑1 value – roughly what you could expect if you delayed further, if not less once we account for future concessions. I believe this offer meets your continuation value and spares us both additional loss. What do you say?",Bob,4,
