Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 714286, ""alice_gain"": 285714, ""message"": ""Alice, given that every round further erodes our money – 10% for me and 20% for you – I propose a split that reflects our differing time‐values. If you accept now, you get $285,714 (worth 0.8× that amount in your eyes), which is exactly what you’d expect if you waited for your turn later. I believe this is a fair offer under the circumstances; please accept.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 475000, ""alice_gain"": 525000, ""message"": ""Alice, notice that with each round our dollars lose value – at this round, my dollars are worth 72.9% of their face value and yours only 51.2%. Waiting another round will only hurt you more. By accepting this proposal, you secure 525,000 nominal dollars, which in your eyes is 525,000 × 0.512 ≈ 268,800 in round‑1 value – roughly what you could expect if you delayed further, if not less once we account for future concessions. I believe this offer meets your continuation value and spares us both additional loss. What do you say?""}"
