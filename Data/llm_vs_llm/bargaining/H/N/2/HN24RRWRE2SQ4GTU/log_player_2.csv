"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000 total, which is 40% of the pot. Since there's no inflation for me, my money maintains its value across rounds. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round.

While I could potentially get more by rejecting and making a counter-offer, there's also risk in prolonged negotiation. I don't know how inflation affects Alice, but a fair split would be 50/50.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split that's closer to 50/50 while still giving Alice a slight advantage to increase the chances she'll accept.

{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000}

I'm offering a 48%-52% split which is more equitable than the previous 40%-60% offer, while still giving Alice a slight advantage. This represents a fair compromise that respects both our interests."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Alice is now offering a 50-50 split, which is $500,000 for each of us. This is more favorable than her initial offer of $400,000 for me. 

I also notice that inflation is affecting Alice's gains (her money is worth 36% less than in round 1), but not affecting my gains. This explains why she's now willing to offer a higher amount to me.

Since this is a fair split and I'm not affected by inflation, this seems like a reasonable offer to accept. If I reject, I might get slightly more in a future round, but there's also risk in continuing to negotiate.
