"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a strategic split considering that Bob's money loses 20% value each round. If he rejects, he'll need to offer in the next round where his money is worth less. I'll offer a fair but advantageous split.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I offer Bob $400,000 now, which is better than a potentially larger sum later due to his 20% value loss per round."
