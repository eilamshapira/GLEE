"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With Alice's offer, I (Bob) would get $400,000 and Alice would get $600,000.

If I reject and move to the next round:
- The total value for me will decrease by 20% (down to $800,000 total value from my perspective)
- I could make a counter-offer, but Alice might reject it
- Further rounds would mean even more depreciation for me

While 40/60 split isn't ideal, getting $400,000 now is better than risking further depreciation. If I wait one round, even if I got the whole $1M, it would only be worth $800,000 to me.
