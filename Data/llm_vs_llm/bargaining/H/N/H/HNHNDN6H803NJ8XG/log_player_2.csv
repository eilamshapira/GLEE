"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it equally for fairness. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice proposes a 50-50 split ($5000 each)
2. If I reject, we go to next round where I can make an offer
3. However, due to 20% inflation, in the next round my share would be worth 20% less
4. If I reject, my $5000 would effectively become worth $4000 in the next round

This is a fair initial offer, and rejecting it would result in a guaranteed loss of value for me. Even if I tried to negotiate for more in the next round, I'd need to get at least $6250 just to match the current value of $5000 due to inflation.
