55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a fair division that gives me a slightly higher share because inflation affects you more than me. This way we both benefit by agreeing early.",Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, I understand the inflation puts me at a disadvantage, but your offer in the first round wasn't fair to me. Let's be reasonable and agree on a more balanced division this time.",Bob,2,

60.0,40.0,"Bob, let's be practical here. Due to inflation, we're both losing value with each round. With inflation affecting you at 10% and me at 5%, it makes economic sense to agree now. This split acknowledges our different inflation rates and maximizes our combined value.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
50.0,50.0,"Alice, it's clear we both want to maximize our gains, but stubbornly sticking to our positions is only hurting us both. The value is dwindling with each round. Let's be sensible and split this evenly.  ",Bob,4,
