"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a fair division that gives me a slightly higher share because inflation affects you more than me. This way we both benefit by agreeing early.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the inflation puts me at a disadvantage, but your offer in the first round wasn't fair to me. Let's be reasonable and agree on a more balanced division this time. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical here. Due to inflation, we're both losing value with each round. With inflation affecting you at 10% and me at 5%, it makes economic sense to agree now. This split acknowledges our different inflation rates and maximizes our combined value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it's clear we both want to maximize our gains, but stubbornly sticking to our positions is only hurting us both. The value is dwindling with each round. Let's be sensible and split this evenly.   
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50
