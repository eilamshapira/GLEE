"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Seems fair, right? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer...

Alice is proposing a 50-50 split of $10,000, which would give each of us $5,000. This is a perfectly fair and equal division.

While I could reject and try to get a better deal in the next round, I need to consider that:
1. The money will be worth 10% less in the next round
2. Alice might respond to a more aggressive proposal with a rejection
3. A 50-50 split is a common and fair solution

Given that this is a fair offer and there's risk in waiting, I'll accept.
