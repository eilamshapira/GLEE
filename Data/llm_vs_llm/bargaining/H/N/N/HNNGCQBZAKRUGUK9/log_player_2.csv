"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I get $999999 and you get $1. Waiting only hurts your share (each round you lose 10% of the value), while my share remains intact. Accepting this offer now guarantees you something rather than almost nothing if you wait. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
