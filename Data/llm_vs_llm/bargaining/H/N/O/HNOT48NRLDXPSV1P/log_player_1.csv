"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, offering slightly more to Bob to incentivize acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 480000, ""bob_gain"": 520000}

I propose this split because it's close to equal but gives Bob a slight advantage, which might encourage them to accept rather than risk further rounds of negotiation. This way we can both walk away with a substantial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While it's slightly less favorable than my initial proposal, it's still a reasonable split, and accepting now ensures we both get a substantial amount without risking further negotiations that could lead to worse outcomes or potential deadlock."
