5000.0,5000.0,Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Since inflation affects you more than me (10% vs 5% per round), we should both want to conclude quickly. However, this difference in inflation rates also means an even split isn't optimal. I'm proposing a 55/45 split that accounts for our different positions while still being fair. Let's avoid further inflation losses.",Bob,2,

4600.0,5400.0,Let's find a middle ground. This offer takes into account the inflation difference and is more favorable to you than my initial offer.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4300.0,5700.0,"Alice, I appreciate your movement toward a more favorable split. Since we're now in round 4, inflation has already reduced the total value significantly - more for you than for me. Let's settle this quickly with a 57/43 split that recognizes our different inflation rates. If we keep going, we both lose more value with each round, but you lose at twice the rate I do. This offer is fair given our positions.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
4700.0,5300.0,"Let's be realistic about the inflation impact. I'm willing to compromise, but we need to find a balance that acknowledges the disproportionate effect on my share.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, we've now gone through nearly half the possible rounds, and the inflation impact is severe - particularly for you. Your last offer was actually less favorable to me than your previous one, which doesn't reflect our changing positions due to inflation. At this point, a 60/40 split fairly accounts for our different inflation rates and the rounds already passed. If we continue further, you'll lose almost half your value by round 8, while I'll lose about 30%. Let's conclude this now with a reasonable compromise that reflects our situation.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
4200.0,5800.0,"Time is running out, and inflation is taking a heavy toll on my share. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but we need to find a balance before it's too late.",Alice,7,
