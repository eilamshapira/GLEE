"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since inflation affects you more than me (10% vs 5% per round), we should both want to conclude quickly. However, this difference in inflation rates also means an even split isn't optimal. I'm proposing a 55/45 split that accounts for our different positions while still being fair. Let's avoid further inflation losses. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation rates and the fact that the money is worth 10% less for me in this round, I should act quickly to minimize losses.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob in each round, I'll try to make a more favorable offer.

After two rounds, the money is worth:
- For me: 10,000 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 8,100
- For Bob: 10,000 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 9,025

Considering this, I'll make the following offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4600, 
""bob_gain"": 5400, 
""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground. This offer takes into account the inflation difference and is more favorable to you than my initial offer.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your movement toward a more favorable split. Since we're now in round 4, inflation has already reduced the total value significantly - more for you than for me. Let's settle this quickly with a 57/43 split that recognizes our different inflation rates. If we keep going, we both lose more value with each round, but you lose at twice the rate I do. This offer is fair given our positions. 
# Alice gain: 4300 
# Bob gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the increasing difference in inflation rates and the fact that the money is worth 27.1% less for me, I should consider the potential losses if the game continues.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","After four rounds, the money is worth:
- For me: 10,000 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 6,561 (approximately 34.1% less than the original value)
- For Bob: 10,000 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 8,143 (approximately 18.57% less than the original value)

Considering the significant reduction in value for me, I'll try to make a more competitive offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4700, 
""bob_gain"": 5300, 
""message"": ""Let's be realistic about the inflation impact. I'm willing to compromise, but we need to find a balance that acknowledges the disproportionate effect on my share.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we've now gone through nearly half the possible rounds, and the inflation impact is severe - particularly for you. Your last offer was actually less favorable to me than your previous one, which doesn't reflect our changing positions due to inflation. At this point, a 60/40 split fairly accounts for our different inflation rates and the rounds already passed. If we continue further, you'll lose almost half your value by round 8, while I'll lose about 30%. Let's conclude this now with a reasonable compromise that reflects our situation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the significant reduction in value for me (40.95% less than the original) and the fact that Bob's offer is becoming increasingly favorable to him, I should carefully consider the potential losses if the game continues.

However, a 60/40 split still seems quite unfavorable to me, especially considering I'm the one who's losing value at a much faster rate.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","After six rounds, the money is worth:
- For me: 10,000 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 5,467 (approximately 45.33% less than the original value)
- For Bob: 10,000 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 7,325 (approximately 26.75% less than the original value)

Considering the severe reduction in value for me and the limited number of rounds left, I'll try to make a competitive offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4200, 
""bob_gain"": 5800,
