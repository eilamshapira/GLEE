350000.0,650000.0,"Alice, I appreciate your quick pace, but since we’ve already passed the first round, it's in both our interests to cut further delays. I'm offering to keep $650000 and awarding you $350000. Accepting this now avoids any further risks of lost value due to inflation. Looking forward to a swift agreement.",Bob,2,

520000.0,480000.0,"Hi Bob, understanding the impact of inflation, I have adjusted my offer. I'm proposing $520000 for myself and $480000 for you. This is a more balanced split, and we should act swiftly to mitigate further losses. Let's finalize this deal!",Alice,3,

10000.0,990000.0,"Alice, I understand your desire for a balanced outcome, but with each round your share loses value while mine remains steady. Looking ahead, if we delay further your next proposal will force you into a position where you'll have to offer me nearly everything to gain my acceptance. To prevent further losses on your end, I’m offering you $10000 now. It’s not a large sum, but it’s better than risking a future where, due to inflation, you could end up with nothing. I hope you appreciate the urgency and act swiftly.",Bob,4,
