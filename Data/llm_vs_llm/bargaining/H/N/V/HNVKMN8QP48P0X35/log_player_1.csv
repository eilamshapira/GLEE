Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your quick pace, but since we’ve already passed the first round, it's in both our interests to cut further delays. I'm offering to keep $650000 and awarding you $350000. Accepting this now avoids any further risks of lost value due to inflation. Looking forward to a swift agreement. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire for a balanced outcome, but with each round your share loses value while mine remains steady. Looking ahead, if we delay further your next proposal will force you into a position where you'll have to offer me nearly everything to gain my acceptance. To prevent further losses on your end, I’m offering you $10000 now. It’s not a large sum, but it’s better than risking a future where, due to inflation, you could end up with nothing. I hope you appreciate the urgency and act swiftly.
