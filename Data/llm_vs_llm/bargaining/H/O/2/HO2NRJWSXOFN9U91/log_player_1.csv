"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to avoid inflation reducing the total value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I think 55-45 is a more reasonable split. Let's settle this before the money loses more value. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
* If I accept now, I get $45, but it's worth 20% less due to inflation, so effectively $36
* If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount I get will be worth 40% less than original value
* Even if I managed to get $70 in the next round, it would only be worth $42 after the 40% inflation
* Bob's current offer of $45 (worth $36 to me) is likely better than what I could achieve in future rounds due to compounding inflation
