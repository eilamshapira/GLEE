"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Let's start with a fair 50-50 split. This gives us both an equal share of the money without any delay. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

With a 20% depreciation per round for me, accepting early is generally better than waiting. If I reject now and propose in the next round, any amount I receive will already be worth 20% less to me.

The 50-50 split offered by Alice is objectively fair, and I would receive $500,000 at full value. If I reject and try to negotiate for more in subsequent rounds, I would need to secure significantly more than $500,000 to make up for the depreciation.

Given that:
1. It's a fair initial offer
2. I avoid any depreciation by accepting now
3. There's no guarantee I could get a better deal later
4. Alice might become less cooperative if I reject a fair offer
