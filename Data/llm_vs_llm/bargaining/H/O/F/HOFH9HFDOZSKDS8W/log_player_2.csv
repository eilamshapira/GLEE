"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that with each passing round, money is worth 10% less for Alice but 0% less for me, I might be able to get a more favorable split by moving to later rounds. However, I also have to consider that we only have 12 rounds total, and if we don't reach an agreement, we both get nothing.

Alice has offered an even 50-50 split. While this is fair in absolute terms, considering the time pressure affects Alice more than me, I believe I can propose a better split for myself in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money depreciates 10% each round for Alice but not for me, I should make an offer that takes this into account. In future rounds, Alice would likely accept less than 50% due to the time pressure. For round 2, I'll propose a split that's slightly in my favor but still reasonable enough that Alice might accept it rather than continue to later rounds where her share would be worth even less.

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I'm offering you 40% of the money, which is still substantial. Given that waiting another round would devalue your portion by 10%, accepting this offer now would be more valuable than getting slightly more in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has increased her offer to me from 50 to 55, which is moving in my direction but not as much as my offer of 60-40. Given that I have no time pressure (0% depreciation) while Alice faces 10% depreciation each round, I can afford to hold out for a better deal. By round 4, Alice's money will be worth about 27% less than the first round, which gives me more leverage.

However, I should also consider that we only have 12 rounds total, and waiting too long could risk ending up with nothing if we don't reach an agreement.

Since I still think I can get a better offer in the next round, and I don't face any disadvantage from waiting:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since we're now in round 4, Alice's money has already depreciated significantly (by about 27%). She's shown willingness to move from a 50-50 split to a 55-45 split in my favor. Given the continued depreciation she faces and my advantage in having no depreciation, I'll increase my request slightly but make it reasonable enough that she might accept rather than continue to later rounds.

{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35}

I'm offering you 35% of the total amount. Considering that your share is depreciating by 10% each round, accepting this offer now would be more valuable than potentially getting a similar or slightly better offer in future rounds when the money would be worth even less to you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has now offered me 60% of the money, which matches what I offered in round 2. She's been gradually increasing my share (from 50 to 55 to now 60), showing she understands the time pressure she's under. 

At this point, I need to carefully consider whether to accept or continue negotiating:

1. Alice's money is already worth 34.39% less than in round 1
2. If I reject, we go to round 6, where Alice's money will be worth about 41% less than round 1
3. We're approaching the midpoint of our 12 rounds
4. Alice has been consistently improving her offers

While I might be able to get an even better deal by waiting, there's also increasing risk that we might not reach an agreement within the 12 rounds. Since Alice has moved to match my earlier offer, I'll accept this offer as a reasonable compromise.
