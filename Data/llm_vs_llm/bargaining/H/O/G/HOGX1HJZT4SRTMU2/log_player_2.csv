"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. It's a fair 50-50 split
2. If I reject, the total amount will be worth $95 in the next round due to 5% inflation
3. Even if I could get a slightly better deal in the next round, the loss from inflation would likely offset any gains
4. This is a reasonable first offer that treats both parties equally
