"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering me $4,500 while taking $5,500 for herself. Given that my money loses 10% value each round, I need to consider if waiting for a better deal is worth it.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, I'd potentially get less value due to the 10% inflation penalty. The $4,500 now is worth more than potentially getting $5,000 next round (which would only be worth $4,500 after inflation).
