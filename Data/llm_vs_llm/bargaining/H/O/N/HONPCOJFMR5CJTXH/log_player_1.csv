"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer to Bob for dividing the $100, keeping in mind that inflation affects us differently (10% for me, 5% for Bob) with each passing round.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I think this offer is fair since we both face inflation if we delay. If we don't reach an agreement now, I lose value faster than Bob does. This split gives Bob a substantial portion while acknowledging that I'm in a slightly weaker negotiating position due to the higher inflation rate I face."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer of a 50-50 split. While it's not the 55-45 split I initially proposed, I need to consider that inflation affects me more severely (10% per round versus Bob's 5%). If I reject and we move to another round, my potential gains would be worth even less. The 50-50 split is fair considering our different inflation rates, and accepting now preserves more value for me than continuing to negotiate."
