"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, 50-50 split. What do you say, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

With each round, Alice's value decreases by 5%, while mine stays the same. This means if I reject, in the next round:
- I can make an offer
- Alice will value the money 5% less
- I might be able to get a better deal

However, there's risk in prolonging negotiations, as we only have 12 rounds and could end up with nothing.

Given this is the first round and Alice's opening with a fair 50-50 split, it might be wise to accept and secure a decent outcome rather than risk deterioration of negotiations.
