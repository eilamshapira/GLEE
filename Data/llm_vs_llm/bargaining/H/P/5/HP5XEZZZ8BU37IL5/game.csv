45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but I think a 55/45 split is more reflective of the situation.  We both know delaying is costly, so let's settle this fairly.",Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but let's be fair. Each round costs me significantly due to my 10% inflation penalty. This 55-45 split in my favor is reasonable - it accounts for my inflation burden while still giving you a substantial amount. Let's reach an agreement now rather than both losing value with more delays.",Alice,3,

50.0,50.0,"Alice, let's be realistic. We both lose with each passing round. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Take it now, or we risk both losing out.",Bob,4,
