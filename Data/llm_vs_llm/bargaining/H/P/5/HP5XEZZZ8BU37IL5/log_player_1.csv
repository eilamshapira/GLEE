"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob that takes into account the 10% inflation penalty I face with each round.

{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor. Since I'm facing 10% inflation each round, delaying costs me significantly. This is a fair offer considering our different inflation positions.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but I think a 55/45 split is more reflective of the situation.  We both know delaying is costly, so let's settle this fairly. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but let's be fair. Each round costs me significantly due to my 10% inflation penalty. This 55-45 split in my favor is reasonable - it accounts for my inflation burden while still giving you a substantial amount. Let's reach an agreement now rather than both losing value with more delays.""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic. We both lose with each passing round. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Take it now, or we risk both losing out. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50
