"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor. Since I'm facing 10% inflation each round, delaying costs me significantly. This is a fair offer considering our different inflation positions.

# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but I think a 55/45 split is more reflective of the situation.  We both know delaying is costly, so let's settle this fairly.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but let's be fair. Each round costs me significantly due to my 10% inflation penalty. This 55-45 split in my favor is reasonable - it accounts for my inflation burden while still giving you a substantial amount. Let's reach an agreement now rather than both losing value with more delays. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Alice claims a high inflation rate, there's no guarantee it's true. Accepting now avoids further losses, but it sets a precedent for her to push for a larger share in future rounds.  I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can secure a better split."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. We both lose with each passing round. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Take it now, or we risk both losing out.""}"
