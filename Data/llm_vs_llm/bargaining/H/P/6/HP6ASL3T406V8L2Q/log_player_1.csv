"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a slightly favorable split for me, but still attractive enough for Bob to consider accepting rather than risking inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose that I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000. This is a reasonably fair split that gives me a slight advantage but still offers Bob a substantial sum. If Bob declines, they'll make a counter-offer, but we'll both lose 5% value due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I'll get $450,000 Ã— 0.95 = $427,500 (effective value due to 5% inflation)
- If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount will be worth another 5% less
- Bob's position seems to have weakened more than mine (10% vs 5% inflation)
- However, continuing the game means guaranteed loss of value for both of us

Since $427,500 is still a significant sum, and continuing would mean further value erosion, I'll accept this offer.
