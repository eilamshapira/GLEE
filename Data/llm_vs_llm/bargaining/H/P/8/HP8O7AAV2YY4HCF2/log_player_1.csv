"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Split it evenly, no need to wait""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's make a deal. I believe this is a fair split considering the time pressure and the risk of inflation for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect on me, I need to act quickly to maximize my gain. However, Bob's offer seems a bit unfair. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each round, and 5% less for Bob, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself while still being reasonable.

In Round 2, the value for me would be $1,000,000 * 0.9 = $900,000, and in Round 3, it would be $900,000 * 0.9 = $810,000.

Considering this, I'll make the following offer:

{""alice_gain"": 460000, 
""bob_gain"": 540000, 
""message"": ""More reasonable split, considering inflation""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this offer secures a good portion for you while acknowledging the increasing impact of inflation. Let's settle this now. 
# Alice gain: 410000 
# Bob gain: 590000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is still not in my favor, but I need to consider the increasing inflation effect on my potential gain. Since the money is worth 27.1% less for me, I'm effectively getting $1,000,000 * (1 - 0.271) = $729,000 at most.

Bob's offer of $410,000 is roughly 56% of the maximum value I could get, considering the inflation. This is still a bit low, but I should be cautious not to let the inflation reduce my potential gain further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 27.1% less for me in Round 4, and 14.26% less for Bob, in Round 5, it would be worth approximately:

$1,000,000 * (1 - 0.271) * 0.9 = $656,100 for me (if I were to receive the full amount)

Considering this, I'll make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better split:

{""alice_gain"": 470000, 
""bob_gain"": 530000, 
""message"": ""Last chance for a reasonable split, inflation is killing me""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time. This is a strong offer considering inflation's impact. Let's be reasonable and close this deal. 
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is worth 40.95% less for me, which means I'm effectively getting $1,000,000 * (1 - 0.4095) = $595,050 at most.

Bob's offer of $420,000 is roughly 70.5% of the maximum value I could get, considering the inflation. While it's still not an even split, the inflation is significantly reducing my potential gain, and I should be cautious not to let it drop further.

Given the time pressure and the increasing inflation effect, I think it's time to reconsider my stance.
