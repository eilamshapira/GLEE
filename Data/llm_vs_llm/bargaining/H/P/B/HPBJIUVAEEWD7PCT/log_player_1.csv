"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer to divide the $100, considering that inflation will decrease the value of the money by 20% each round for me.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest we split the money with me getting $55 and you getting $45. This is close to a fair split while accounting for the inflation risk I face if we go to additional rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
