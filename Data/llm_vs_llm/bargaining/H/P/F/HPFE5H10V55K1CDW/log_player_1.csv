"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the 5% inflation and the proposed split, I must decide whether to accept Bob's offer.

First, let's calculate the effective value of my potential gain in Round 2. My initial offer in Round 1 of 600000 is worth 5% less in round 2.

If I accept the offer, I will receive 450000 now. If I reject it, I will get a chance to make an offer in round 3 with further inflation.
The value of 450000 is more than the expected amount after inflation.

Therefore:

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
