"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer that considers both our interests, especially taking into account the different inflation rates we face.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because if we go to another round, the total value decreases more significantly for Bob (20% loss) than for me (5% loss). This gives you a good portion now rather than risking greater depreciation in future rounds."
