"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: I get $40, Alice gets $60
2. If I reject, in the next round:
   * The money will be worth 20% less to me ($100 * 0.8 = $80 total value for me)
   * For Alice, it'll be worth 95% ($100 * 0.95 = $95 total value for her)
   * I can make a counter-offer, but the total value is already diminished

While $40 is less than half, if I reject:
* Any amount I could get in the next round would be from a pot that's effectively worth $80 to me
* Even if I proposed a very favorable split for myself in the next round, Alice might reject it since her depreciation is much lower (5%)
* This could lead to a cycle where we both lose value

The current offer of $40 is better than getting a larger percentage of a depreciated amount in the next round.
