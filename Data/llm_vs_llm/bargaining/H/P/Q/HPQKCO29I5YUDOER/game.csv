6897.0,3103.0,"Hello Bob, in light of our different discounting—5% for me per round and 10% for you—I propose dividing the $10000 so that I receive $6897 and you receive $3103. This split reflects the standard equilibrium in alternating-offer bargaining and should be fair to both of us now. I look forward to your acceptance so we can avoid further loss from inflation.",Alice,1,
