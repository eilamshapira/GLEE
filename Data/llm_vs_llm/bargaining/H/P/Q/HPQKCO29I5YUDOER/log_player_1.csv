"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6897, ""bob_gain"": 3103, ""message"": ""Hello Bob, in light of our different discounting—5% for me per round and 10% for you—I propose dividing the $10,000 so that I receive $6,897 and you receive $3,103. This split reflects the standard equilibrium in alternating-offer bargaining and should be fair to both of us now. I look forward to your acceptance so we can avoid further loss from inflation.""}"
