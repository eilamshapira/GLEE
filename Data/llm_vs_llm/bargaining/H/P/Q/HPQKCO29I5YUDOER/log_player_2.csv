"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, in light of our different discounting—5% for me per round and 10% for you—I propose dividing the $10000 so that I receive $6897 and you receive $3103. This split reflects the standard equilibrium in alternating-offer bargaining and should be fair to both of us now. I look forward to your acceptance so we can avoid further loss from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 3103 
# Alice gain: 6897 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
