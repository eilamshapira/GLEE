"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split this fairly. I'm offering you a generous share. Are you in? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's offer considering the risk of inflation in future rounds.

Alice is offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000, which is 40% of the total. She's taking $600,000, or 60%.

If I reject and we go to round 2, the total amount will be worth 10% less - so only $900,000 total. Even if I proposed a 50-50 split in the next round, I'd get $450,000 and Alice would get $450,000. 

That would be slightly better for me than the current offer ($450,000 vs $400,000), but Alice might reject it, leading to round 3 where the money would be worth even less.

Given the inflation risk and the fact that $400,000 is still a substantial amount, I'll accept Alice's offer.
