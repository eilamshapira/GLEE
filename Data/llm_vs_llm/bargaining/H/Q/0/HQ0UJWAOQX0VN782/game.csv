34.48,65.52,"Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for an immediate agreement: I receive $34.48 and you receive $65.52. Accepting now avoids any further discounting of the money in later rounds. Looking forward to your agreement.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
30.0,70.0,"Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm offering you $30.  Take it now, or the deal will get worse for both of us.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob’s current proposal gives me $30 nominal, which under the 10% discount means I’d effectively receive only about $27 compared to what an alternating‐offers equilibrium would suggest I should secure by waiting. Given that rejecting lets me propose in the next round (albeit with further discounting) and that the equilibrium share for me as the responder in Bob’s proposal should be around 34.5 nominal (about $31 in effective value), it’s in my best interest to reject this offer.",Alice,2,reject
86.51,13.49,"Hi Bob, here’s my proposal in Round 3. I know waiting costs us—my money is worth only 80% of its original value now, and yours 90%. If you reject, you’ll get to propose in Round 4; however, given the unfolding discounts, as proposer you’d be forced to offer me nearly all of the $100 to meet my future expectations. In fact, working backwards, your best continuation value would be about 12.14 (in round‑1 dollars) effective. That means in Round 3 you’d need at least about $13.49 nominal (since 0.90 × 13.49 ≈ 12.14) for the deal to be worthwhile. Therefore, I propose that you receive $13.49 and I receive $86.51. This deal is better for you than waiting for Round 4, so I hope you accept.",Alice,3,

85.0,15.0,"Alice, this is my final offer. Take it, or we both lose out.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob's final offer gives me $85 nominal in round 4, which—after accounting for the 27.1% devaluation—is worth about $62 in round‑1 terms. Since rejecting means we both end up with nothing, I accept the deal.",Alice,4,accept
