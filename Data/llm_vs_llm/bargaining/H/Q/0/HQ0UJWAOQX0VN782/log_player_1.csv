"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 34.48, ""bob_gain"": 65.52, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for an immediate agreement: I receive $34.48 and you receive $65.52. Accepting now avoids any further discounting of the money in later rounds. Looking forward to your agreement.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm offering you $30.  Take it now, or the deal will get worse for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob’s current proposal gives me $30 nominal, which under the 10% discount means I’d effectively receive only about $27 compared to what an alternating‐offers equilibrium would suggest I should secure by waiting. Given that rejecting lets me propose in the next round (albeit with further discounting) and that the equilibrium share for me as the responder in Bob’s proposal should be around 34.5 nominal (about $31 in effective value), it’s in my best interest to reject this offer.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 86.51, ""bob_gain"": 13.49, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here’s my proposal in Round 3. I know waiting costs us—my money is worth only 80% of its original value now, and yours 90%. If you reject, you’ll get to propose in Round 4; however, given the unfolding discounts, as proposer you’d be forced to offer me nearly all of the $100 to meet my future expectations. In fact, working backwards, your best continuation value would be about 12.14 (in round‑1 dollars) effective. That means in Round 3 you’d need at least about $13.49 nominal (since 0.90 × 13.49 ≈ 12.14) for the deal to be worthwhile. Therefore, I propose that you receive $13.49 and I receive $86.51. This deal is better for you than waiting for Round 4, so I hope you accept.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. Take it, or we both lose out. 
# Alice gain: 85 
# Bob gain: 15 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Bob's final offer gives me $85 nominal in round 4, which—after accounting for the 27.1% devaluation—is worth about $62 in round‑1 terms. Since rejecting means we both end up with nothing, I accept the deal.""}"
