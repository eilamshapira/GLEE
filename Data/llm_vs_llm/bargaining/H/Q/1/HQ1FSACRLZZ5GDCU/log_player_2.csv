Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, 50-50. This is the fairest approach and allows us both to walk away with a substantial amount.

# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I understand you want to split evenly, but I'm facing higher risk with inflation. How about a 60/40 split in my favor? This accounts for the risk while still leaving you with a good amount.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concern about inflation, but I'm also taking a risk by going another round. This 45/55 split is a fair compromise that acknowledges your inflation concern while still being reasonable for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
