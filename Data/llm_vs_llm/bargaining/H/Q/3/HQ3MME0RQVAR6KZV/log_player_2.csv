"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
* She's offering me $40 and keeping $60
* If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
* However, due to 5% inflation per round, my $40 would become worth $38 next round
* I need to consider that Alice has no inflation penalty
* I might be able to negotiate a better deal, but there's risk if we go too many rounds

Given that it's early in the game and I could probably get a better deal even accounting for one round of inflation, I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more favorable to me while still being reasonable enough that Alice might accept it:

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'm proposing this split because:
1. It gives me a majority share but isn't extremely greedy
2. If Alice rejects, her next offer would need to give me more than 52.25 (55 * 0.95) to be worth accepting
3. It's a fair improvement over her initial 40-60 split
4. We both have incentive to finish early due to my inflation penalty"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze Alice's new offer:
* She's offering me $42, but with 9.75% inflation, it's actually worth $37.91 to me
* Her previous offer of $40 would have been worth $36.10 at current inflation
* So this is only a slight improvement in real terms
* If I reject and make a counter-offer, my next potential gain will be subject to 14.5% inflation
* We've already used 3 rounds, and only have 9 left
* The negotiations aren't moving very quickly in my favor

However, I think I can still do better. Even with the next round's inflation, I could propose a split that would net me more value. While the inflation penalty is concerning, there's still enough rounds left to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that we're now in round 4 and my inflation penalty is becoming significant, I'll make a strong but still reasonable offer:

{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48}

This offer is slightly lower than my previous one because:
1. With the current inflation rate, I need to be more realistic to get an agreement
2. It's still significantly better than Alice's last offer of 42
3. If Alice rejects this and we go another round, my gains will be subject to about 19.5% inflation
4. We need to reach agreement soon to avoid losing too much value to inflation
5. It's a more balanced split that Alice might be more likely to accept"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze Alice's new offer:
* She's offering me $43, but with 18.55% inflation, it's actually worth $35.02 to me
* Her previous offer of $42 would have been worth $34.23 at current inflation
* We're 5 rounds in, with 7 rounds remaining
* The negotiations are moving very slowly (Alice's offers: 40 → 42 → 43)
* If I reject, the next round will have 23.55% inflation
* My counter-offers (55 → 52) haven't moved Alice much

The trend is concerning. While $43 isn't great, the inflation is seriously eroding my negotiating power. Each round is costing me more than it's costing Alice. If this continues, I might end up with even less, or nothing if we run out of rounds.
