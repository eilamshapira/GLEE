"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

My reasoning is that I'm starting with a slight advantage in the negotiation, but I want to make an offer that's reasonable enough for Bob to accept. This gives me a majority, but still leaves a significant portion for Bob."
