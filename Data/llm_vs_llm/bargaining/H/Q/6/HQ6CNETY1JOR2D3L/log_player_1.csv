"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob! I propose we divide the money with me getting $60 and you getting $40. This seems fair since I initiated the game, and we can both walk away with a significant amount before inflation takes a bite. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit unfair. How about we split it 55/45? I get a little more since I have to make a new proposal now, but it's still a good deal for you considering inflation is eating away at the money. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Hey Bob, let's try an even split this time. With inflation, this seems like a fair deal for both of us, given that the money's value is decreasing. We can both walk away with an equal share before it shrinks further. What do you think?""}"
