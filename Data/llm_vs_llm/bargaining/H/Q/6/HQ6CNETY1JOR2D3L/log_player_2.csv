"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I propose we divide the money with me getting $60 and you getting $40. This seems fair since I initiated the game, and we can both walk away with a significant amount before inflation takes a bite. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Alice, that's a bit unfair. How about we split it 55/45? I get a little more since I have to make a new proposal now, but it's still a good deal for you considering inflation is eating away at the money.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, let's try an even split this time. With inflation, this seems like a fair deal for both of us, given that the money's value is decreasing. We can both walk away with an equal share before it shrinks further. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
