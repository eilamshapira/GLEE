"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the offer, I need to decide whether to accept Bob's offer.

My money is worth 5% less this round, so the $45 I would receive is equivalent to $45 * (1 - 0.05) = $42.75 in the first round.

Let's assess: in the first round, I proposed $60 for myself. Now I am offered $45, which is less, and it is worth even less due to inflation.

Therefore, I will reject the offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for round 3, taking into account the continuing inflation. I'll try to adjust my proposal to make it more appealing to Bob this time.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
