"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. I'm being offered $40 out of $100
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to inflation:
   - My $40 would become worth $36 next round (10% less)
   - Alice's $60 would become worth $57 next round (5% less)
4. This means the total pie is shrinking faster for me than for Alice

While $40 isn't the most generous offer, the inflation penalty makes waiting costly for me. However, I think I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round, as the inflation hit isn't too severe for just one round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll make a more balanced counter-offer. I need to consider that:
1. Alice will face 5% inflation if she rejects
2. A fair offer increases the chances of acceptance
3. The total amount needs to be divided fully ($100)

I'll propose a more equitable split, slightly in my favor:

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

This offer is more balanced than Alice's initial proposal, and considering the inflation penalties Alice faces, it should be attractive enough for her to accept. If she rejects, her $45 would be worth about $42.75 in the next round due to her 5% inflation rate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Current offer: $45 for me, which is actually worth $36.45 (due to 19% inflation)
2. If I reject and wait another round:
   - The inflation penalty will increase to 29% for me
   - So my money will be worth even less next round
   - A similar amount would only be worth about $32 next round

Alice has improved her offer from the first round (from 40 to 45), and given the accelerating inflation impact on my share, waiting longer is becoming increasingly costly for me. The difference between our inflation rates (19% vs 9.75%) means I'm losing negotiating power with each round.
