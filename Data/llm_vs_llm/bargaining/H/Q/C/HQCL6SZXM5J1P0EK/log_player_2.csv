"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

# Message to Alice:
While your offer is fair, I think the asymmetry in inflation effects means we should consider that in our split. I'll make a counterproposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Considering the inflation affects me more, I propose to divide the amount into 5500$ for me and 4500$ for you. This way, we both acknowledge the decreasing value of money over time.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given the impact of inflation on both of us, I propose a slight adjustment from my initial offer. This way, you get a bit more to compensate for the higher inflation rate affecting you, while I still maintain a fair share considering my lower inflation rate. 
# Bob gain: 5050 
# Alice gain: 4950 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
