"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to make a strategic offer considering the 20% inflation per round and the uncertainty about how inflation affects Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I suggest this division because it's fair to give you a somewhat larger portion given the inflation pressure I face. If we go to another round, the $100 will only be worth $80 to me due to 20% inflation, so I'm incentivized to reach an agreement now. I hope you'll find this split reasonable and we can conclude our negotiation."
