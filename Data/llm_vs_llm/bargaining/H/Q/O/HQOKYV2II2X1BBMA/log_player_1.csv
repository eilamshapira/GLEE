"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll play as Alice in this game. Let me make my first offer to Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose we split the money with $600,000 for me and $400,000 for you, Bob. This is a fair offer that gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging that I'm facing 10% inflation with each round, which puts me at a disadvantage if we delay."
