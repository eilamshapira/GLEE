6000.0,4000.0,Let's be fair. I need a bit more due to future inflation affecting me.,Alice,1,

1500.0,8500.0,"Alice, every additional round further erodes your share by 20%, while mine stays intact. Accept this offer now to secure a guaranteed payoff—waiting only risks you getting less overall. Let's close the deal.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, inflation is hurting me a lot. Let's split it evenly this time to compensate. It's still a good deal for you.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
1.0,9999.0,"Alice, further delay will leave you with virtually nothing. In round 5 you’d be forced to offer almost every dollar to Bob because of the heavy inflation hitting your share (your money will be worth only about 41% next round). Accept this offer now – even though it seems lopsided nominally, waiting guarantees you no effective gain at all.",Bob,4,
