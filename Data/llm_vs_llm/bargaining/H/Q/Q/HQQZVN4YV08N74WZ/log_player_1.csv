"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every additional round further erodes your share by 20%, while mine stays intact. Accept this offer now to secure a guaranteed payoff—waiting only risks you getting less overall. Let's close the deal. 
# Alice gain: 1500 
# Bob gain: 8500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, further delay will leave you with virtually nothing. In round 5 you’d be forced to offer almost every dollar to Bob because of the heavy inflation hitting your share (your money will be worth only about 41% next round). Accept this offer now – even though it seems lopsided nominally, waiting guarantees you no effective gain at all. 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 9999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
