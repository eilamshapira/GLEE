"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair. I need a bit more due to future inflation affecting me. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 8500, ""alice_gain"": 1500, ""message"": ""Alice, every additional round further erodes your share by 20%, while mine stays intact. Accept this offer now to secure a guaranteed payoff—waiting only risks you getting less overall. Let's close the deal.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, inflation is hurting me a lot. Let's split it evenly this time to compensate. It's still a good deal for you. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 9999, ""alice_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Alice, further delay will leave you with virtually nothing. In round 5 you’d be forced to offer almost every dollar to Bob because of the heavy inflation hitting your share (your money will be worth only about 41% next round). Accept this offer now – even though it seems lopsided nominally, waiting guarantees you no effective gain at all.""}"
