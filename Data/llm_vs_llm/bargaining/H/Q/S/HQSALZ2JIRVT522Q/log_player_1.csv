"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer to divide the $10,000 between Bob and me.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose a 50-50 split, which gives us both an equal share of $5,000. This is a fair division that recognizes both of our interests in this negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new offer considering what I've learned about Bob's preferences.

{""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""bob_gain"": 5500}

I propose a slightly adjusted split that gives Bob more than an equal share while still ensuring I receive a fair portion. Since Bob seems to want more than half, but inflation affects his gains each round, this compromise might be mutually beneficial rather than continuing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I notice that Bob is asking for increasingly more with each round, though his money is worth less due to inflation. Let me make another offer that moves further toward his preferences while still protecting my interests.

{""alice_gain"": 4000, 
""bob_gain"": 6000}

I'm proposing the same split that Bob offered in round 2, giving him $6,000 and me $4,000. This acknowledges his desire for a larger share while preventing further rounds of inflation that would affect his gains."
