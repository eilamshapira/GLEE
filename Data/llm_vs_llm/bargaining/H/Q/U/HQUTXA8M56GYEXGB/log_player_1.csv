Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

This is a tricky situation due to the asymmetric inflation. Here's why I made this offer:

* **Time Pressure:**  The value of the money decreases significantly for me with each round. It's better to secure a decent amount now than risk getting even less later.
* **Predicting Bob:** Bob's previous offer suggests he's aiming for a slightly larger share. By decreasing my ask, I'm hoping to find a compromise before the inflation hurts me further. 

Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is severely cutting into my potential gains. While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer now prevents further losses due to the decreasing value of the money."
