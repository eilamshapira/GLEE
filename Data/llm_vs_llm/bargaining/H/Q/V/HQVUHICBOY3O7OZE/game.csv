600000.0,400000.0,I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to avoid the 10% inflation penalty from further rounds.,Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Let's split it 55-45 in my favor. Considering the inflation, it's a reasonable offer. Don't let the value decrease further!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Let's meet in the middle with a 55-45 split in my favor. With inflation affecting us both, we should reach an agreement now. If we continue, I'll lose 10% more next round, and you'll lose another 5% - making both of us worse off.",Alice,3,
