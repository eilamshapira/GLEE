"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 55-45 in my favor. Considering the inflation, it's a reasonable offer. Don't let the value decrease further! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 10% inflation for me, $450,000 would actually be worth $405,000 in round 1 terms.
Bob's offer of 45% is less than what I offered initially, and with inflation, it's even worse.

If I reject and make a new offer in round 3, my share would face another 10% inflation, making it even harder to get a good deal.

However, this is still significantly less than my initial proposal of 60-40, and I believe I can still get a better deal even with some inflation in the next round.
