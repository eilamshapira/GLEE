"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a fair 50-50 split, which gives us both $5000. This is the most equitable solution. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether this is the best offer for me, given the 10% inflation penalty for each round.

If I accept now, I get $5,000.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total amount will effectively be worth 10% less to me ($9,000 value to me). Even if I could get more than 50% in the next round, I'd need to get at least $5,556 (about 62% of the $9,000 value) just to break even with the current $5,000 offer.

The 50-50 split is fair, and the inflation penalty makes rejecting risky.
