"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair and equal split - $500000 each. This way we both walk away with significant amounts. With inflation reducing the value by 5% each round, it's in both our interests to resolve this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me carefully evaluate Alice's offer.

Alice is offering a 50-50 split, which would give me $500,000. This is a fair division of the total amount.

However, I need to consider the inflation effect. If I reject this offer, we move to the next round where I can make a counter-offer, but the money will be worth 20% less to me. This means in the next round, the $1,000,000 would only be worth $800,000 from my perspective.

Given the significant inflation penalty and the fact that Alice is offering an equal split, accepting now seems like the rational choice.
