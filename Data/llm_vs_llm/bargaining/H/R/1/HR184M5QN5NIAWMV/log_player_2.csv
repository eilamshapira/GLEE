Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle of our previous offers 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer seems to meet in the middle, it's important to consider the decreasing value of the money for her.  She's likely getting more desperate for a deal. By continuing to reject, I increase the pressure on her to offer a larger share to me."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""The value is dropping fast for both of us, especially you, Alice.  Let's end this with a perfectly fair 50/50 split.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a 50/50 split now. This might seem generous, but it's strategic.  

* **Time Pressure:**  Alice is feeling the pressure of the decreasing value more than I am.  
* **Appearing Reasonable:** By previously rejecting offers and now proposing a fair split, I appear willing to compromise and be reasonable. This might push Alice to accept. 
* **Avoiding a Loss:** If I get too greedy, Alice might reject this offer and the decreasing value will hurt us both.  

Let's see if this convinces her to settle!"
