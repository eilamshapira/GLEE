"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering a 50-50 split of the $10,000. This seems fair on the surface, but I need to consider the inflation effect.

If I reject this offer, I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. However, the money will be worth 10% less to me then. So if I were to get the same $5,000 in the next round, it would effectively be worth only $4,500 to me due to the 10% inflation.

Since Alice is offering me half of the total amount right now, when it has its full value to me, this is a reasonable offer.
