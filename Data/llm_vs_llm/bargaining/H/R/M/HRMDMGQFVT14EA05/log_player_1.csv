"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is fair for both of us. I'm facing 20% inflation per round, so this is a reasonable compromise. We can both walk away with a significant amount rather than risking further negotiations. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
