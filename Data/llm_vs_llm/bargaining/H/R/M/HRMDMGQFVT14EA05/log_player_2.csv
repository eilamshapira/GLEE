"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take the lion's share, but you get a decent chunk. Accept and we can both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing I get $100,000 while she takes $900,000 - a 10/90 split. That's quite uneven.

If I reject, I can make a counteroffer next round, but I have to factor in the 20% inflation that affects me. If I reject, my potential $100,000 would only be worth $80,000 in the next round. However, I could propose a more equitable split.

Given this is just the first round and we have up to 12 rounds, I think I should aim for a more balanced division.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while acknowledging the inflation pressure I'm facing.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""I think a 50/50 split is fair for both of us. I'm facing 20% inflation per round, so this is a reasonable compromise. We can both walk away with a significant amount rather than risking further negotiations.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split 70/30. It's a better deal for you than the last round, and still gives me a decent share.  We can avoid further risk of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to analyze this offer carefully. Alice is now proposing I get $300,000, which is better than her first offer of $100,000. However, due to inflation affecting me, this $300,000 is now worth only 64% of what it would have been in round 1, so effectively $192,000 in round 1 terms.

I also now have information that Alice's inflation rate is lower than mine - she's only losing 9.75% per round compared to my 20% compounding loss. This puts me at a disadvantage in prolonged negotiations.

Given this asymmetric inflation and the fact that Alice has improved her offer substantially, this seems reasonable. If I reject, I risk further devaluation of my share, and Alice clearly wants a majority portion.
