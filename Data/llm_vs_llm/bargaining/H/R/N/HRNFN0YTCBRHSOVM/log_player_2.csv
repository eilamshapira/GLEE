"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

1) The offer is a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
2) However, if I reject, I can make my own offer next round
3) Due to inflation:
   - My money will be worth 10% less next round
   - Alice's money will be worth 5% less next round
4) If I reject and propose a better split next round:
   - $5000 now = $5000
   - $6000 next round = $5400 (after 10% inflation)

The inflation penalty makes it risky to reject a fair offer. Even if I ask for more next round, the inflation will eat into my gains. Plus, Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to even more inflation losses.
