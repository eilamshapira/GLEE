"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I'll take $60 and you'll get $40. Let's agree nowâ€”each round we wait costs me 5% in value. I believe this fair split is our best move. What do you say?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're concerned about inflation affecting your value. However, since there's no inflation impact on my end, I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This is still better for you than waiting another round with 5% inflation. Let's finalize this deal now. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
