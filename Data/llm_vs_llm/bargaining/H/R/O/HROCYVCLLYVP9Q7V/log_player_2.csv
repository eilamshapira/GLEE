"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I'll take $60 and you'll get $40. Let's agree nowâ€”each round we wait costs me 5% in value. I believe this fair split is our best move. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $40 while she gets $60, and she mentions that each round costs her 5% in value.

Given that there's no inflation for me (0% mentioned in the rules), I could potentially get a better deal by rejecting this offer and making my own proposal in the next round. Since I don't lose value by waiting, while Alice claims she does, I have a strategic advantage in negotiation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counterproposal that's more favorable to me while acknowledging Alice's concern about inflation affecting her value.

{""bob_gain"": 60, 
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand you're concerned about inflation affecting your value. However, since there's no inflation impact on my end, I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This is still better for you than waiting another round with 5% inflation. Let's finalize this deal now.""}"
