0.0,10000.0,"Hi Bob. Given that my future rounds will devalue my share by 10% while your share remains full value, I recognize that you have a significant bargaining advantage. To avoid any delay that hurts me, I propose that you receive the full $10000 now. I believe an immediate agreement is best for both of us.",Alice,1,

3000.0,7000.0,"Alice, I appreciate your recognition of the time pressure you face, but I believe we can reach a more balanced agreement. I propose I get $7000 and you get $3000. This is still advantageous for me but gives you meaningful value, and accepting now prevents your share from devaluing further.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that if we delay further, my share will suffer a further 10% devaluation per round. Given that rejecting is likely to leave me with even less in any future equilibrium division, I accept the offer of $3000 nominal (worth $2700 to me in round 2).",Alice,2,accept
