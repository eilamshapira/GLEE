"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 0, ""bob_gain"": 10000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob. Given that my future rounds will devalue my share by 10% while your share remains full value, I recognize that you have a significant bargaining advantage. To avoid any delay that hurts me, I propose that you receive the full $10,000 now. I believe an immediate agreement is best for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your recognition of the time pressure you face, but I believe we can reach a more balanced agreement. I propose I get $7000 and you get $3000. This is still advantageous for me but gives you meaningful value, and accepting now prevents your share from devaluing further. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that if we delay further, my share will suffer a further 10% devaluation per round. Given that rejecting is likely to leave me with even less in any future equilibrium division, I accept the offer of $3000 nominal (worth $2700 to me in round 2).""}"
