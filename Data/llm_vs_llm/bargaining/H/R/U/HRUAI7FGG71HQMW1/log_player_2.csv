"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob. Given that my future rounds will devalue my share by 10% while your share remains full value, I recognize that you have a significant bargaining advantage. To avoid any delay that hurts me, I propose that you receive the full $10000 now. I believe an immediate agreement is best for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think this through. Alice is offering me the entire $10,000, which is obviously very favorable for me. However, since I know:

1. Alice's money devalues by 10% each round while mine doesn't
2. I'll be making the next proposal if I reject
3. Alice is being extremely accommodating, perhaps too much so

I believe I can still get a very good deal while being more fair. If I reject, I can propose a more balanced split that would still be advantageous to me due to Alice's time pressure.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer while still leveraging my advantage from the inflation differential:

{""bob_gain"": 7000,
""alice_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your recognition of the time pressure you face, but I believe we can reach a more balanced agreement. I propose I get $7000 and you get $3000. This is still advantageous for me but gives you meaningful value, and accepting now prevents your share from devaluing further.""}"
