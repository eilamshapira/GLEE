55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I'd like to propose that I receive $55 and you receive $45. Agreeing now saves me from the inflation penalty I'll face in later rounds. Let's make a fair deal early!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
50.0,50.0,Let's split it evenly. We'll both benefit from ending the game early and avoiding further inflation.,Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, thank you for the even split offer. Considering that in Round 2 my money is worth 20% less than in Round 1, accepting 50 now gives me an effective value of 40 (in Round 1 terms), which is better than risking further rounds and deeper discounting on my side. I appreciate the early settlementâ€”I'm happy to accept.",Alice,2,accept
