"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'd like to propose that I receive $55 and you receive $45. Agreeing now saves me from the inflation penalty I'll face in later rounds. Let's make a fair deal early!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. We'll both benefit from ending the game early and avoiding further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for the even split offer. Considering that in Round 2 my money is worth 20% less than in Round 1, accepting 50 now gives me an effective value of 40 (in Round 1 terms), which is better than risking further rounds and deeper discounting on my side. I appreciate the early settlementâ€”I'm happy to accept.""}"
