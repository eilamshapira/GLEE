"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose an equal 50/50 split, which is the fairest division. While I face inflation penalties in future rounds, you don't - so this balanced offer benefits us both by concluding the game now. This is better for me than your initial offer and still very reasonable for you. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
