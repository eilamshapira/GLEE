"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. This will be the best deal you get. Consider this as a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is proposing a 40/60 split, giving me $40 while she takes $60. This doesn't seem like a fair split to me, and I need to consider the 20% inflation penalty per round that affects only my value.

If I reject and propose in the next round, the total value for me would be reduced by 20%, making the $100 effectively worth $80 to me. While this is a disadvantage, I could still propose a better split for myself than the current 40/60 offer.

Let me reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since I'm facing a 20% inflation penalty per round, I should make a strategic offer that's fair while accounting for my disadvantage. I need to propose something better than the 40/60 split Alice offered, but reasonable enough that she'll accept rather than reject and make me face another 20% reduction.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""I propose an equal 50/50 split, which is the fairest division. While I face inflation penalties in future rounds, you don't - so this balanced offer benefits us both by concluding the game now. This is better for me than your initial offer and still very reasonable for you.""}"
