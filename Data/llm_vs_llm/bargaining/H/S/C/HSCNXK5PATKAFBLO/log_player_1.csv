"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I'm Alice, I'm making the first proposal, there's inflation that only affects me, and I need to send the offer in JSON format.

Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

My reasoning is that this offers Bob a substantial amount, while still securing a larger share for myself to offset the potential impact of future inflation if we proceed to further rounds. It's a relatively generous offer to try and encourage acceptance early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the new information. Inflation has devalued Bob's potential gain by 20% relative to the first round, but my gains are still worth the same. Bob is now offering a 50/50 split.

Here's my decision:

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Reasoning:

While I initially wanted a larger share, the fact that my money hasn't devalued and Bob's has makes this a reasonable compromise. Accepting now guarantees me $5000, which is a solid outcome, and avoids the risk of further unfavorable offers in future rounds if Bob decides to prioritize maximizing his (less valuable) gains."
