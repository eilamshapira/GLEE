"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal! This offer gives you a good chunk and avoids us both losing out to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze the situation.

*   **Current Round:** 1
*   **Bob's Offer Value:** 300000
*   **Alice's Offer Value:** 700000
*   **Rounds Remaining:** 11

If I reject this offer, I'll have to make a proposal in round 2. If Alice rejects that, my potential gains will decrease by 20% each round due to inflation.

Let's calculate the value of Alice's offer over the remaining rounds for me if it were to be rejected until the end. Let's assume I manage to secure 500,000 each round.

*   Round 2: 500000 * 0.8 = 400000
*   Round 3: 400000 * 0.8 = 320000
*   Round 4: 320000 * 0.8 = 256000
*   Round 5: 256000 * 0.8 = 204800
*   Round 6: 204800 * 0.8 = 163840
*   Round 7: 163840 * 0.8 = 131072
*   Round 8: 131072 * 0.8 = 104857.6
*   Round 9: 104857.6 * 0.8 = 83886.08
*   Round 10: 83886.08 * 0.8 = 67108.864
*   Round 11: 67108.864 * 0.8 = 53687.0912
*   Round 12: 53687.0912 * 0.8 = 42949.67296

Even if I could secure 500,000 each round, the diminishing returns make it very unattractive. Now let's assume I secure 300,000 each round.

*   Round 2: 300000 * 0.8 = 240000
*   Round 3: 240000 * 0.8 = 192000
*   Round 4: 192000 * 0.8 = 153600
*   Round 5: 153600 * 0.8 = 122880
*   Round 6: 122880 * 0.8 = 98304
*   Round 7: 98304 * 0.8 = 78643.2
*   Round 8: 78643.2 * 0.8 = 62914.56
*   Round 9: 62914.56 * 0.8 = 50331.648
*   Round 10: 50331.648 * 0.8 = 40265.3184
*   Round 11: 40265.3184 * 0.8 = 32212.25472
*   Round 12: 32212.25472 * 0.8 = 25769.803776

It is risky to reject as this offer is much better than what I may get if I reject this offer.
