"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I take $4,000 while she gets $6,000 of the $10,000. While this isn't an even split, I should keep in mind that with each passing round, the money is worth 20% less to me due to inflation, while Alice faces no such penalty. If I reject and we move to round 2, the $10,000 would only be worth $8,000 to me.

Given the inflation penalty I face, accepting $4,000 now may be better than potentially getting a higher nominal amount in later rounds that's worth less to me.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to make a reasonable offer that Alice will accept, considering that I'm facing a 20% inflation penalty per round while she isn't. If we continue negotiating, the total value will decrease significantly for me.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I propose an even 50-50 split of the money. This is a fair division that gives us both equal shares. While I could ask for more to compensate for my inflation disadvantage, an equal split is objectively fair and should be acceptable to Alice."
