4500.0,5500.0,"Hi Alice, I've considered your offer. Since I face a 10% inflation penalty each round, I need a higher percentage to maintain value. This 55-45 split is fair considering the inflation disadvantage I have. If we continue to the next round, I'll lose 10% more value, so we both benefit by agreeing now.",Bob,2,
