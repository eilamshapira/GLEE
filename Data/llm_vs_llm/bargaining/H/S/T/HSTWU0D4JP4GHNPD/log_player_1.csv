Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I've considered your offer. Since I face a 10% inflation penalty each round, I need a higher percentage to maintain value. This 55-45 split is fair considering the inflation disadvantage I have. If we continue to the next round, I'll lose 10% more value, so we both benefit by agreeing now. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
