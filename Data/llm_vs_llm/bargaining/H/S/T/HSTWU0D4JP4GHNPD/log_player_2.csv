"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether to accept Alice's offer or to reject it and make a counter-offer.

Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000, which is 40% of the total. If I reject this offer, I can make my own proposal in the next round, but due to the 10% inflation penalty, the money will be worth less to me. The $10,000 would effectively be worth $9,000 to me in the next round.

Since I would need to get more than $4,000 in the next round to beat the current offer's value, and considering the negotiation dynamics and inflation penalty, I'll make my decision.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that accounts for the inflation penalty while being fair enough that Alice might accept it.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I've considered your offer. Since I face a 10% inflation penalty each round, I need a higher percentage to maintain value. This 55-45 split is fair considering the inflation disadvantage I have. If we continue to the next round, I'll lose 10% more value, so we both benefit by agreeing now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering your inflation loss, this is a more reasonable split 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer carefully.

Alice is now offering me $4,200, which is a slight improvement from her initial $4,000 offer. However, with the 19% inflation penalty in this round, the $4,200 is actually worth $4,200 Ã— (1 - 0.19) = $3,402 in terms of round 1 value.

If I reject and we go to round 4, I'll face a 27.1% inflation (compounded 10% three times), making the money worth even less to me.

Alice's offer of $4,200 in this round is worth less to me than her initial offer of $4,000 in round 1. Since we're moving in the wrong direction due to inflation, and further delays will only decrease my purchasing power, I should accept this offer.
