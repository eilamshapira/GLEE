Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value I'd get is 45 * 0.9025 = 40.6125. Since this is still more than what I would have gotten if I accepted the initial offer, and I rejected that one, I'll reject this one as well.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Due to inflation, the money I gain is worth 9.75% less in round 2 and another 5% less in round 3, and now another 5% less in round 4, so it's worth 0.9025 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.8134 of the original value.

I'll make a new offer, taking into account the decreasing value of the money for me.
