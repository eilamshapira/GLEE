"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. I'm Alice, I need to account for inflation impacting my returns each round, Bob's money doesn't depreciate, and we only have 12 rounds. Here's my initial offer, trying to get a decent return while leaving Bob enough to accept and avoid losing out entirely:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   I'm offering Bob $40, which is a significant portion and might be enough for him to accept.
*   I'm keeping $60 for myself, which, in round 1, is a decent amount considering the depreciation I'll face in later rounds. I assume Bob is somewhat rational and will see the risk of rejecting and potentially ending up with nothing if we reach the final round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob rejected my initial offer and is now proposing a 50/50 split. Let's analyze this:

*   **Bob's gain:** $50. This is more than my previous offer to him, which makes sense.
*   **My gain:** $50. However, due to the 20% inflation, this $50 is only worth $50 * 0.8 = $40 in terms of round 1 dollars.

Considering the inflation and the potential for even worse offers in later rounds, I will accept this.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
