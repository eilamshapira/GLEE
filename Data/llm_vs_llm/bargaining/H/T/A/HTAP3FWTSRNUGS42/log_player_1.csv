"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I will propose a division of the $10,000, keeping in mind the rapidly decreasing value of the money to me. Since this is round 1 and I'm proposing, I need to make a reasonable offer that Bob will accept, or the inflation will hurt me more.

Here is my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I see Bob's offer. It's a straight 50/50 split.

I need to consider the inflation. For me, $5000 in this round is worth 80% of what it would have been in round 1. That's like receiving $4000 in round 1 money.

Let's think. If I reject this and go to round 3, I'll be making the offer, but the money will be worth even less to me. And I don't know how long Bob is willing to play this game. He might think the money is worthless to me by round 12, and take it all!

Given the risk of further devaluation and that Bob's offer is still a fair split, I will accept.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
