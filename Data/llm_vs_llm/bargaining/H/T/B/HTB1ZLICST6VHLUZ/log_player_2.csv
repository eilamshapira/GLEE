"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Since I'm starting the proposal, I'm suggesting a $60/$40 split. If you accept, we both walk away with a significant amount considering the current value. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether Alice's proposal is fair or if I should make a counter-offer, keeping in mind the 10% inflation penalty for waiting.

If I reject, we go to the next round where I can make a proposal, but the total amount will be worth only $90. Even if I proposed a more favorable split for myself then, we'd both potentially get less in absolute terms due to the inflation.

While a 50/50 split might seem most fair in principle, Alice's 60/40 offer gives me $40 now, which is better than potentially getting less in future rounds after inflation.
