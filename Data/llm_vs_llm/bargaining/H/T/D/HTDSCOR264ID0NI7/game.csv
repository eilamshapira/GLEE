55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I'm suggesting we split the money with me getting $55 and you getting $45. This is fair considering inflation affects me by 20% each round, so I need a bit more now to offset that. If we delay, we both lose value - I lose 20% each round, and you likely face some inflation too. Let's make a deal now so we both walk away with good value.",Alice,1,

50.0,50.0,"Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I think a fair split would be beneficial for both of us. Let's split the money equally, with each of us getting $50. This way, we both walk away with equal value, and we can avoid the risk of losing more value to inflation in future rounds.",Bob,2,
