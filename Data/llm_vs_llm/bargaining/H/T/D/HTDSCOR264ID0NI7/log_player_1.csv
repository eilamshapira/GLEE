"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting we split the money with me getting $55 and you getting $45. This is fair considering inflation affects me by 20% each round, so I need a bit more now to offset that. If we delay, we both lose value - I lose 20% each round, and you likely face some inflation too. Let's make a deal now so we both walk away with good value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I think a fair split would be beneficial for both of us. Let's split the money equally, with each of us getting $50. This way, we both walk away with equal value, and we can avoid the risk of losing more value to inflation in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
