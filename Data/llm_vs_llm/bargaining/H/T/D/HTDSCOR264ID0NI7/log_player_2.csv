"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting we split the money with me getting $55 and you getting $45. This is fair considering inflation affects me by 20% each round, so I need a bit more now to offset that. If we delay, we both lose value - I lose 20% each round, and you likely face some inflation too. Let's make a deal now so we both walk away with good value. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I think a fair split would be beneficial for both of us. Let's split the money equally, with each of us getting $50. This way, we both walk away with equal value, and we can avoid the risk of losing more value to inflation in future rounds.""}"
