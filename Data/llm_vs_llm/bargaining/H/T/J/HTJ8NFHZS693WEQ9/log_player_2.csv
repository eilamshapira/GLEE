"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer seems quite unfair, as I would only receive $30 while she would get $70. Given that inflation will reduce the value of my share by 20% in the next round, I need to consider that carefully. However, her split is too uneven, and I believe I can propose a more equitable division in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a more balanced offer that accounts for the inflation affecting me.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'm offering a slightly better deal for myself to account for the 20% inflation penalty I face with each passing round. This is fair because if we continue to another round, the total value decreases for me, while Alice faces no such penalty. This split represents a reasonable division that benefits both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has slightly improved her offer from round 1, but I'm now facing 36% inflation, which means the $35 is actually worth only about $22.40 to me in terms of original value. The situation is becoming worse for me with each round due to the asymmetric inflation penalty.

Given that I'll face even higher inflation (around 49%) if I reject and we go to round 4, and Alice seems unwilling to accept a more balanced split, I should carefully consider this offer.
