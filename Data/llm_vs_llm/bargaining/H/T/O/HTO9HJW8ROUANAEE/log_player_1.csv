"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7000, 
""bob_gain"": 3000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 70-30 split. Since you face 20% devaluation each round, accepting now gives you the highest real value for your share.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the devaluation is a factor. How about a 60-40 split? This seems fairer considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. I would get $6000, which is less than my previous offer of $7000
2. Bob would get $4000, but due to 20% devaluation, it's actually worth $3200 to him
3. If I reject, we go to round 3 where I can make another offer, but Bob's value will decrease further
4. This is a reasonable offer considering the negotiation dynamics
