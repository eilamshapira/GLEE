"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 83.18 
# Alice gain: 16.82 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
- Alice is offering me $83.18 (83.18% of the total)
- I would receive a very good portion of the money
- If I reject, the money will be worth 5% less for me in the next round
- For Alice, the money will be worth 20% less, giving me stronger negotiating power
- However, this is already a very favorable offer for me

Given that this is a very generous offer right from the start, and considering that any delay would reduce the value for both of us, I'll accept.
