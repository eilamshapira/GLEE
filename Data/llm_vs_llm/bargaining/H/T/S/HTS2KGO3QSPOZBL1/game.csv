,,,Bob,1,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Alice, I think a 50-50 split is much fairer for both of us. We both walk away with a substantial amount, and we can end this quickly. Remember that inflation affects me each round, so it's in my interest to resolve this soon - but I need a fair deal to accept.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
800000.0,200000.0,"Bob, I appreciate the idea of a quick resolution, but I need a bit more from this deal.  This offer still ensures you walk away with a good sum.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Alice, I appreciate you improving your offer. I'm also willing to compromise from my 50-50 proposal. This 40-60 split acknowledges your stronger position regarding inflation, but also represents a fair division that respects both our interests. With each round, my position weakens due to inflation, so it makes sense for us to reach an agreement soon. This is a reasonable middle ground.",Bob,4,

750000.0,250000.0,"Bob, we're getting closer! I'm showing some flexibility here.  Let's settle this now and both benefit from the deal.",Alice,5,

650000.0,350000.0,"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility. I see we're moving toward an agreement, and I'm also willing to adjust my expectations. This 35-65 split acknowledges your advantageous position with inflation not affecting you, while still giving me a reasonable share. We're now in round 6, and my inflation penalty is significant. Let's find common ground soon - this offer balances both our interests fairly given the circumstances.",Bob,6,
