Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think a 50-50 split is much fairer for both of us. We both walk away with a substantial amount, and we can end this quickly. Remember that inflation affects me each round, so it's in my interest to resolve this soon - but I need a fair deal to accept.

# Bob gain: 500000

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you improving your offer. I'm also willing to compromise from my 50-50 proposal. This 40-60 split acknowledges your stronger position regarding inflation, but also represents a fair division that respects both our interests. With each round, my position weakens due to inflation, so it makes sense for us to reach an agreement soon. This is a reasonable middle ground. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

I'm aiming higher than 60%. While I need to acknowledge the time pressure and the fact that Bob is feeling the inflation effect, I believe I can still secure a better deal."

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility. I see we're moving toward an agreement, and I'm also willing to adjust my expectations. This 35-65 split acknowledges your advantageous position with inflation not affecting you, while still giving me a reasonable share. We're now in round 6, and my inflation penalty is significant. Let's find common ground soon - this offer balances both our interests fairly given the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 650000 
# Bob gain: 350000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm pushing it close, but I'll hold out for a slightly better deal one more time. Bob is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, and I think he'll be more willing to concede in the next round."
