"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's end this quickly. A generous offer for you to take. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's offering me $100,000 out of the $1,000,000 total, which is 10% of the pot. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but I'll be affected by 10% inflation, meaning the total value to me would be $900,000.

Let me think through this strategically. I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer, even accounting for the inflation. Alice's characterization of this as ""generous"" doesn't match the 10/90 split she's proposing.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split, taking inflation into account while offering Alice a significant portion.

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I think a 50-50 split is much fairer for both of us. We both walk away with a substantial amount, and we can end this quickly. Remember that inflation affects me each round, so it's in my interest to resolve this soon - but I need a fair deal to accept.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the idea of a quick resolution, but I need a bit more from this deal.  This offer still ensures you walk away with a good sum. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer carefully. She's now offering me $200,000, which is double her previous offer, but still only 20% of the total. Due to 19% inflation, this $200,000 would be worth approximately $162,000 to me in original round 1 value.

It seems Alice isn't affected by inflation, which puts me at a disadvantage as negotiations continue. While she has improved her offer, the split is still quite uneven at 20/80.

Given that we have many rounds left, and Alice showed willingness to increase her offer, I think I can still negotiate for a better deal, even accounting for my inflation penalty.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 400000,
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you improving your offer. I'm also willing to compromise from my 50-50 proposal. This 40-60 split acknowledges your stronger position regarding inflation, but also represents a fair division that respects both our interests. With each round, my position weakens due to inflation, so it makes sense for us to reach an agreement soon. This is a reasonable middle ground.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer! I'm showing some flexibility here.  Let's settle this now and both benefit from the deal. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to analyze Alice's latest offer. She's now offering me $250,000, which is a 25/75 split. However, with the 34.39% inflation, this $250,000 would be worth approximately $164,025 to me in original round 1 value.

Alice has increased her offer from $200,000 to $250,000, showing some movement toward compromise. However, the split is still quite uneven, and my position continues to weaken with each passing round due to inflation.

Given that we're in round 5 out of 12 possible rounds, and Alice seems willing to negotiate gradually upward, I think there's still room to get a better offer. However, I need to be mindful that my bargaining power decreases with each round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 350000,
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility. I see we're moving toward an agreement, and I'm also willing to adjust my expectations. This 35-65 split acknowledges your advantageous position with inflation not affecting you, while still giving me a reasonable share. We're now in round 6, and my inflation penalty is significant. Let's find common ground soon - this offer balances both our interests fairly given the circumstances.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. It's a fair deal that reflects the situation we are in.  Let's close this deal now and avoid further losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's ""final offer."" She's offering me $300,000, which is a 30/70 split. With 46.86% inflation affecting me, this $300,000 would be worth approximately $159,420 in original round 1 value.

Important considerations:
1) Alice claims this is her final offer
2) We're now in round 7 of 12
3) My inflation penalty continues to increase significantly each round
4) The difference between this offer and my last proposal is narrowing (I proposed 35/65, she's offering 30/70)

Given the accelerating inflation that only affects me, and the risk that Alice might not improve her offer further, accepting this offer is likely better than continuing negotiations. The potential gain from further rounds may be outweighed by the inflation losses.
