"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 444444 
# Alice gain: 555556 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to think about this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $444,444 while she gets $555,556. That's about 44.4% for me and 55.6% for her.

If I reject, we go to round 2 where I make the offer, but inflation means the money is worth 10% less to me. So the total would effectively be worth $900,000 to me. If I were to get 50% of that in the next round, it would be $450,000 - which is slightly better than Alice's current offer.

However, there's risk in rejection. Alice might not accept my counter-offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation for me.

Given that Alice's offer is slightly less than what I might optimally get in the next round (and future rounds carry increasing risk), I'll accept this offer.
