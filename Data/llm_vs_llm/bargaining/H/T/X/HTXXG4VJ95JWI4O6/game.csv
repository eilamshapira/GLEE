600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob! Let's be fair while considering the inflation effect. I'm offering you $400000 while I take $600000. This is equitable since I face 5% inflation each round, and waiting would reduce the value for me. If we both cooperate now, we can both walk away with substantial amounts.",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe a more balanced split considering the inflation effects would be fair. I propose $550000 for me and $450000 for you. This way, we both get a significant amount, and it's a good compromise given the uncertainty of future rounds. Let's settle this now and avoid further risk.",Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I understand your position, but the inflation affects me significantly with each round. At this point, I need at least $550000 to make this worthwhile for me, given that I've already lost about 10% of value from the original amount. This offer gives you a very substantial $450000. Let's conclude this deal now before inflation further reduces the value for me.",Alice,3,

475000.0,525000.0,"Alice, I see your point about the inflation affecting you more severely. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $525000 for me and $475000 for you. This offer takes into account your higher inflation rate while still giving you a significant amount. Let's agree on this to avoid further depreciation of the money.",Bob,4,
