"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob! Let's be fair while considering the inflation effect. I'm offering you $400,000 while I take $600,000. This is equitable since I face 5% inflation each round, and waiting would reduce the value for me. If we both cooperate now, we can both walk away with substantial amounts.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe a more balanced split considering the inflation effects would be fair. I propose $550000 for me and $450000 for you. This way, we both get a significant amount, and it's a good compromise given the uncertainty of future rounds. Let's settle this now and avoid further risk. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000

At this point, I need at least $550,000 to make this worthwhile for me, given that I've already lost about 10% of value from the original amount. This offer gives you a very substantial $450,000. Let's conclude this deal now before inflation further reduces the value for me.""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see your point about the inflation affecting you more severely. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $525000 for me and $475000 for you. This offer takes into account your higher inflation rate while still giving you a significant amount. Let's agree on this to avoid further depreciation of the money.

# Bob gain: 525000
