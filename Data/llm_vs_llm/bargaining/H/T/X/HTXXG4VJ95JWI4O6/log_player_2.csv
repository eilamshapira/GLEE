"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Let's be fair while considering the inflation effect. I'm offering you $400000 while I take $600000. This is equitable since I face 5% inflation each round, and waiting would reduce the value for me. If we both cooperate now, we can both walk away with substantial amounts. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe a more balanced split considering the inflation effects would be fair. I propose $550,000 for me and $450,000 for you. This way, we both get a significant amount, and it's a good compromise given the uncertainty of future rounds. Let's settle this now and avoid further risk.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the inflation affects me significantly with each round. At this point, I need at least $550000 to make this worthwhile for me, given that I've already lost about 10% of value from the original amount. This offer gives you a very substantial $450000. Let's conclude this deal now before inflation further reduces the value for me. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 525000,
  ""alice_gain"": 475000,
  ""message"": ""Alice, I see your point about the inflation affecting you more severely. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $525,000 for me and $475,000 for you. This offer takes into account your higher inflation rate while still giving you a significant amount. Let's agree on this to avoid further depreciation of the money.""
