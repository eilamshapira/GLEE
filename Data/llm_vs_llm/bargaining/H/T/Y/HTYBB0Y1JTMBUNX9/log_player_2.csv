"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $40 while taking $60 for herself. This is less than half for me, but I should also consider inflation - if I reject and we go to another round, my money will be worth 10% less.

If I reject, I can make a counteroffer next round, but the $100 total will effectively be worth only $90 to me due to inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair offer that accounts for the inflation I'm facing.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'm proposing this split because I need to account for the 10% inflation penalty I'm experiencing. A 50/50 split might seem fair at first glance, but since each round reduces the value for me by 10%, I need to ask for slightly more to offset this disadvantage. This offer gives Alice a substantial portion while allowing me to compensate for my inflation penalty."
