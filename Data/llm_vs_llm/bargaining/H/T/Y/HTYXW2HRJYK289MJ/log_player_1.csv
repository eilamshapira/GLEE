"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to agree quickly due to inflation affecting our gains. Let's avoid prolonged negotiations.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose an equal split of 50-50. It's important for both of us to secure some gains before inflation affects us more. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The reasoning for accepting:
1. Due to inflation, my gains are already worth 20% less in this round
2. A 5000$ offer with 20% inflation means I effectively get 4000$
3. If I reject and try to negotiate further, the next round will have another 20% inflation
4. Bob's offer is fair and reasonable
5. The risk of continued negotiation outweighs the potential benefits
Therefore, accepting the 50-50 split now is the best strategic choice."
