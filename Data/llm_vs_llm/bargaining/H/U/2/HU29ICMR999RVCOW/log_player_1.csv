"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a split that accounts for the different inflation rates we face. Since my money loses value faster (20% per round) compared to Bob's (5% per round), I should aim for a favorable first offer while still being reasonable enough for Bob to consider accepting.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

This is a fair 60-40 split, considering that if Bob declines, my future gains will be worth significantly less due to the higher inflation rate I face. I'm offering Bob a substantial amount while protecting myself from the steeper depreciation of my potential future gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Bob is offering me $400,000, but due to 20% inflation, it's actually worth $320,000 to me (400,000 * 0.8)
2. If I reject and propose in the next round:
   - Any amount will be worth another 20% less to me
   - Bob's money will only be worth 5% less
   - The negotiation power shifts more in Bob's favor due to the asymmetric inflation

Given that my inflation rate (20%) is much higher than Bob's (5%), and there's a risk of further devaluation in future rounds, I should strongly consider accepting this offer now rather than risking getting even less in future rounds.
