"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I think a 50-50 split is the fairest approach for both of us. We each get $500000 and avoid further devaluation of the total amount. This is equitable and optimal for both parties. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
