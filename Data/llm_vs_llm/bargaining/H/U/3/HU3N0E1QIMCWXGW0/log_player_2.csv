"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split this fairly! I'm offering you a substantial amount to secure a quick win. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $400,000 while she gets $600,000. While it's not an even split, it's still a substantial amount for me. If I reject, we move to the next round where I can make a counter-offer, but the total value will decrease by 5% (down to $950,000 total).

Let me evaluate if pushing for more is worth the guaranteed 5% loss of total value.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's more balanced while acknowledging the time pressure we both face.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I think a 50-50 split is the fairest approach for both of us. We each get $500,000 and avoid further devaluation of the total amount. This is equitable and optimal for both parties.""}"
