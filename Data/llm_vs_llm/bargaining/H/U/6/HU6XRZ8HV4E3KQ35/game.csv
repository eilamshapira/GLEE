55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob! I'm offering a fair split that slightly favors me since I'm affected by 5% inflation each round while you aren't. If we don't agree now, the total value decreases for me, but not for you. This is a reasonable offer that benefits us both without needing to lose value through delays.",Alice,1,

40.0,60.0,"Since the money doesn't depreciate for me and you're affected by inflation, I'm making a more favorable offer for myself. Considering the decreasing value for you, it's still a good deal to accept now rather than risking further loss in subsequent rounds.",Bob,2,

50.0,50.0,"Bob, I'm proposing an even 50-50 split now. This is completely fair and balanced. Remember that if we go another round, the money will be worth even less to me (15% less than original value), which means I'd likely accept a less favorable deal next round. This 50-50 split is the most equitable solution for both of us right now, and we can both walk away satisfied.",Alice,3,
