"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to divide the $100 with Bob, keeping in mind that delay reduces the value for me due to the 5% inflation per round.

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm offering a fair split that slightly favors me since I'm affected by 5% inflation each round while you aren't. If we don't agree now, the total value decreases for me, but not for you. This is a reasonable offer that benefits us both without needing to lose value through delays.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since the money doesn't depreciate for me and you're affected by inflation, I'm making a more favorable offer for myself. Considering the decreasing value for you, it's still a good deal to accept now rather than risking further loss in subsequent rounds. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Bob, I'm proposing an even 50-50 split now. This is completely fair and balanced. Remember that if we go another round, the money will be worth even less to me (15% less than original value), which means I'd likely accept a less favorable deal next round. This 50-50 split is the most equitable solution for both of us right now, and we can both walk away satisfied.""}"
