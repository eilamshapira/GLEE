"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm offering a fair split that slightly favors me since I'm affected by 5% inflation each round while you aren't. If we don't agree now, the total value decreases for me, but not for you. This is a reasonable offer that benefits us both without needing to lose value through delays. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, 
""alice_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Since the money doesn't depreciate for me and you're affected by inflation, I'm making a more favorable offer for myself. Considering the decreasing value for you, it's still a good deal to accept now rather than risking further loss in subsequent rounds.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm proposing an even 50-50 split now. This is completely fair and balanced. Remember that if we go another round, the money will be worth even less to me (15% less than original value), which means I'd likely accept a less favorable deal next round. This 50-50 split is the most equitable solution for both of us right now, and we can both walk away satisfied. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
