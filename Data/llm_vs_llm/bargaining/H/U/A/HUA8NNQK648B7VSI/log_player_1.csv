"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to consider the inflation factor here. With each round, the money is worth 20% less to me, so I should try to make a fair offer that Bob would accept.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an equal split of the $10,000. This is a fair division that gives us both the same amount. Since I face 20% inflation with each passing round, it's in my interest to reach an agreement quickly, and an equal split is likely to be accepted."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to decide whether to accept Bob's offer or reject it and make a counter-offer.

Bob is offering me $4500, while taking $5500 for himself. Due to inflation, my $4500 is actually worth only $4500 × 0.8 = $3600 in terms of round 1 value.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 3, the money will be worth another 20% less, meaning any amount I get would be worth only 64% of its original value.

Even if I proposed a very favorable split in round 3 (say $6000 for me), that would only be worth $6000 × 0.64 = $3840 in round 1 terms. And Bob might reject that anyway.

Given the inflation penalty and the risk of further rounds, accepting now is better than continuing.
