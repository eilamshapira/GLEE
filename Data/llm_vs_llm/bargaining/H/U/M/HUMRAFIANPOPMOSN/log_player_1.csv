"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to make a reasonable offer to Bob that he's likely to accept, considering the 20% inflation penalty each round for me. Let's go with an even split to start.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I offer a 50-50 split of the money. This way we both get an equal share, which seems fair and should be acceptable to you, Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this carefully. Bob has offered me $400,000, which due to 20% inflation is effectively worth $400,000 × 0.8 = $320,000 to me now. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, any money I receive will be worth another 20% less.

If I reject, the best I could reasonably hope for is around $500,000 in the next round, but that would be worth only $500,000 × 0.64 = $320,000 to me after two rounds of inflation. Plus, Bob might reject that offer anyway.

Given the diminishing value of money to me with each round, and the risk of getting nothing if we can't agree in 12 rounds, accepting $400,000 now (worth $320,000 to me) seems reasonable.
