600000.0,400000.0,Let's start with a fair split. I propose 60% for me and 40% for you. This leaves room for negotiation.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"I appreciate your opening offer, but I believe a 50-50 split is more fair. We both benefit from reaching an agreement quickly due to inflation affecting the money's value. Let's make this deal and both walk away with a solid amount.",Bob,2,
,,"I understand your perspective, but I believe my initial offer was more balanced considering the risks. Let me think about this further. I'll make a new proposal in the next round.",Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Let's settle on this to avoid further devaluation due to inflation.,Alice,3,
