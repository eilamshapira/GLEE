Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your opening offer, but I believe a 50-50 split is more fair. We both benefit from reaching an agreement quickly due to inflation affecting the money's value. Let's make this deal and both walk away with a solid amount. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
