"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I propose 60% for me and 40% for you. This leaves room for negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

At Round 1, there's no inflation impact yet. Alice is offering me $400,000 out of $1,000,000.

While a 50-50 split might seem more ""fair,"" this isn't a terrible opening offer considering:
1. I still have 11 more rounds if needed
2. But each round will cost me 5% in value
3. If we reach round 12 without agreement, we both get nothing

However, I believe I can get a better deal. With inflation only at 5% for the next round, I can afford to make a counter-offer. If Alice rejects my next proposal, my $400,000 would only decrease to $380,000 in round 3, so there's room to negotiate.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while acknowledging Alice's willingness to negotiate.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Let's settle on this to avoid further devaluation due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $450,000, but due to 9.75% inflation, it's actually worth $406,125 to me
2. This is slightly better than her first offer (after accounting for inflation)
3. If I reject and we continue:
   - Next round will have 14.5% inflation for me
   - Another rejection could significantly decrease my potential gains
   - Alice seems willing to negotiate reasonably
4. The offer is quite fair considering:
   - It's a middle ground between our previous proposals
   - Inflation is only affecting my side
   - We still have 9 rounds left, but continuing would likely hurt me more than Alice

Given that inflation is asymmetric (affecting only my gains) and Alice has made a reasonable compromise, it's wise to accept now before my potential gains decrease further.
