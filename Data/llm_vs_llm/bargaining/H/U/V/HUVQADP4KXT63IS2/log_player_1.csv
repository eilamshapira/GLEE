"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split that gives both of us a good portion, but with a slight advantage to me as the first mover.

{""alice_gain"": 5400, ""bob_gain"": 4600}

I'd explain to Bob: ""I'm proposing a 54-46 split, which is fairly balanced. If you reject, we'll both lose value due to the 5% inflation, making this a reasonable offer."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. The total amount is still $10,000, but worth 5% less due to inflation
2. My offered share is $5,200, which after 5% inflation is effectively $4,940
3. This is less than what I offered Bob in round 1, but not by much
4. If I reject, we'll lose another 5% in the next round
5. The difference isn't worth the risk of further depreciation
