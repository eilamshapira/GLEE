"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

1. Current offer: I get $4000, Alice gets $6000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, any money I get next round will be worth 5% less to me
4. If I reject, my $4000 would effectively become worth $3800 next round
5. Alice faces no inflation penalty, so she has less pressure to accept

While I could try to negotiate for more, the inflation penalty makes this a risky strategy. The current offer of $4000 is not ideal but acceptable, and trying for more could leave me worse off due to inflation.
