307388.0,692612.0,"Hi Bob, I propose that we split the million dollars as $307388 for me and $692612 for you. Given that delaying further reduces the value—20% per round for me and 10% for you—this offer reflects the subgame‐perfect equilibrium outcome if we were to proceed. I believe settling now is in both our best interests. What do you think?",Alice,1,
