Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 307388, ""bob_gain"": 692612, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that we split the million dollars as $307,388 for me and $692,612 for you. Given that delaying further reduces the value—20% per round for me and 10% for you—this offer reflects the subgame‐perfect equilibrium outcome if we were to proceed. I believe settling now is in both our best interests. What do you think?""}"
