71.43,28.57,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing that I receive $71.43 and you receive $28.57. Given that every extra round means we lose value—10% for me and 20% for you—this split is fair. Waiting would only reduce what we both end up with. I think it’s best to agree now and avoid the further loss in value.",Alice,1,

60.0,40.0,"Considering the inflation, I think 40-60 is a more reasonable split. You still get more, but I'm not losing too much. Let's settle on this before the money loses more value.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob’s proposal gives me $60, which, with the round‐2 discount (10% for me), is effectively worth $54 in round‑1 terms. If I reject, I’ll be the proposer in round 3 and, following equilibrium logic in such bargaining games with our respective discount factors (0.9 for me and 0.8 for Bob), I can expect an outcome whose round‑1 equivalent value is around $57.86. Since $57.86 exceeds $54, it’s in my best interest to reject this offer.",Alice,2,reject
90.48,9.52,"Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for round 3. Given the inflation rates, in this round my money is worth 80% of its face value and yours is worth 60%. If you reject, you’ll become the proposer in round 4 where you can only secure an effective payoff of about $5.71 (by offering me just enough to match my continuation value) while the division will further diminish in value. So to make you just as well off now, I’m offering you $9.52 nominal dollars (which is worth about $5.71 in round‑3 terms) and keeping $90.48 for myself. Accepting now prevents additional value loss for both of us. What do you say?",Alice,3,
