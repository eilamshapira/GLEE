"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 71.43, ""bob_gain"": 28.57, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing that I receive $71.43 and you receive $28.57. Given that every extra round means we lose value—10% for me and 20% for you—this split is fair. Waiting would only reduce what we both end up with. I think it’s best to agree now and avoid the further loss in value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I think 40-60 is a more reasonable split. You still get more, but I'm not losing too much. Let's settle on this before the money loses more value. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob’s proposal gives me $60, which, with the round‐2 discount (10% for me), is effectively worth $54 in round‑1 terms. If I reject, I’ll be the proposer in round 3 and, following equilibrium logic in such bargaining games with our respective discount factors (0.9 for me and 0.8 for Bob), I can expect an outcome whose round‑1 equivalent value is around $57.86. Since $57.86 exceeds $54, it’s in my best interest to reject this offer.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 90.48, ""bob_gain"": 9.52, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for round 3. Given the inflation rates, in this round my money is worth 80% of its face value and yours is worth 60%. If you reject, you’ll become the proposer in round 4 where you can only secure an effective payoff of about $5.71 (by offering me just enough to match my continuation value) while the division will further diminish in value. So to make you just as well off now, I’m offering you $9.52 nominal dollars (which is worth about $5.71 in round‑3 terms) and keeping $90.48 for myself. Accepting now prevents additional value loss for both of us. What do you say?""}"
