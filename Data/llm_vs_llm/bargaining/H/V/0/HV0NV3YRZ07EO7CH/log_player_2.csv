"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing that I receive $71.43 and you receive $28.57. Given that every extra round means we lose value—10% for me and 20% for you—this split is fair. Waiting would only reduce what we both end up with. I think it’s best to agree now and avoid the further loss in value. 
# Bob gain: 28.57 
# Alice gain: 71.43 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 40, 
""alice_gain"": 60, 
""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 40-60 is a more reasonable split. You still get more, but I'm not losing too much. Let's settle on this before the money loses more value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for round 3. Given the inflation rates, in this round my money is worth 80% of its face value and yours is worth 60%. If you reject, you’ll become the proposer in round 4 where you can only secure an effective payoff of about $5.71 (by offering me just enough to match my continuation value) while the division will further diminish in value. So to make you just as well off now, I’m offering you $9.52 nominal dollars (which is worth about $5.71 in round‑3 terms) and keeping $90.48 for myself. Accepting now prevents additional value loss for both of us. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 9.52 
# Alice gain: 90.48
