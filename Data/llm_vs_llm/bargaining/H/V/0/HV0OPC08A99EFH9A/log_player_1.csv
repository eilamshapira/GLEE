Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know you value future gains, but waiting means further losses on your end due to inflation. If you accept 450000 now, you secure more than you likely would in round 3. Let's avoid further decreases and close the deal now. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000
