"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob in this first round, balancing the value of getting a deal done now (to avoid the 10% inflation) with a fair share for myself.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a slightly higher share for myself since I know I face 10% inflation per round, which incentivizes me to close the deal now. This is a fair offer that avoids both of us losing total value through delays.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your inflation concerns, but I'm also facing inflation. Let's split it more fairly. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor this round. This is a reasonable compromise considering the risk we both face with further delay. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
