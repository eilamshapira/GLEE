"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering a slightly higher share for myself since I know I face 10% inflation per round, which incentivizes me to close the deal now. This is a fair offer that avoids both of us losing total value through delays. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
