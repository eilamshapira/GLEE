This offer is even worse than his last one from my perspective. I need to signal I'm willing to accept a less favorable split, but not this unfavorable."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're hurting from inflation, I'm not. A 60/40 split is more than generous, considering the value of your share is plummeting. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough one.  While I'd prefer my 55/45 split, I'm getting dangerously close to the point where accepting even Bob's unfavorable offer is better than the value rapidly decreasing. Accepting minimizes potential losses."
