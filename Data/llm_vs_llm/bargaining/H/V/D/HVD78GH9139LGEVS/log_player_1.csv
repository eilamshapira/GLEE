Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, how about we split it 50/50? It's a fair compromise, and we both get an equal share. Let's finalize this deal! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
