"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

If I reject this offer:
- I'll get to make a counter-proposal next round
- But the money will be worth 20% less to me
- $40 now is better than $50 that's worth 20% less ($40) in the next round
- I don't know how inflation affects Alice, so she may be more or less willing to accept a later deal

While a 40-60 split isn't perfectly fair, getting $40 now is probably better than trying to negotiate for more in future rounds when inflation will reduce the real value to me.
