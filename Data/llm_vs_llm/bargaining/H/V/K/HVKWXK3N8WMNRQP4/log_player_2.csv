"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically. Alice is offering me 4000$ out of 10,000$, which is 40% of the total amount. While this isn't an equal split, it's still a substantial amount. However, since this is just the first round and we have 11 more rounds to go, I believe I can negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

In the next round, I'll propose a more equitable distribution."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more equitable split, but still slightly in my favor since Alice tried to take advantage in the first round. I'll also make it a round number to make it more appealing.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has only slightly improved her offer from 4000$ to 4200$ (for me). While she's showing some movement in the right direction, it's still far from an equitable split. With 9 rounds remaining, I believe there's still room for negotiation towards a more balanced distribution.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more moderate proposal this time. Instead of asking for more than half, I'll propose an exactly equal split. This shows fairness and reasonableness on my part, which might make it more likely for Alice to accept.
