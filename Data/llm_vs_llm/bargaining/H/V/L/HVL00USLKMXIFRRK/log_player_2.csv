"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start strong, Bob! I'm offering a slightly better split. How about it? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's proposal gives me $4,000 while she takes $6,000. This is a 40/60 split in her favor. While not an equal division, I need to consider that:

1. I don't know how inflation affects Alice, though it doesn't affect me (0% inflation)
2. We only have 12 rounds total
3. If we reach the end without agreement, we both get nothing

Since this is just the first round, I believe I can get a better offer by making a counter-proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equal split while being reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I think a fair 50/50 split makes the most sense for both of us. This way we both get an equal share of the money. What do you think?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's try this again. I'm increasing my offer slightly, recognizing your point about fairness. Still a bit more favorable to me, but hopefully a good compromise. Ready to end this? 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has increased her offer to me from $4,000 to $4,500, which is a modest improvement. I now understand that Alice is facing inflation (her money is worth 36% less than in the first round), which explains why she's trying to get a larger share.

Her current offer gives me 45% of the total, which is better than the first round. Given that:
1. I'm not affected by inflation
2. Alice is experiencing significant inflation (36%)
3. We've already used 3 of our 12 rounds
4. If we fail to agree by round 12, we both get nothing

I think this is becoming a more reasonable offer. However, I still believe I can negotiate for something closer to 50/50, especially since I'm not affected by inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4800, 
""alice_gain"": 5200, 
""message"": ""Alice, I see you're facing inflation issues which explains your position. I'm moving closer to your proposal with a 48/52 split that should work well for both of us. This seems like a fair compromise given our different situations.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Alright Bob, let's be realistic. I'm getting closer to splitting it almost perfectly. I really need to get some money before it loses even more value. This is as good as it gets from my side. Last chance? 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has improved her offer to $4,900 for me and $5,100 for herself, which is nearly an even split (49/51). I now see that she's facing severe inflation - her money has lost 59.04% of its value since the first round.

Given that:
1. We're already in round 5 of 12
2. Alice's inflation problem is getting worse (from 36% to 59.04%)
3. I'm still not affected by inflation
4. The offer is very close to equal (49/51)
5. The risk of getting nothing increases as we use more rounds

This is a very reasonable offer under the circumstances. I think it makes sense to accept now rather than risk further rounds where Alice may need to ask for more due to worsening inflation, or where we might run out of rounds entirely.
