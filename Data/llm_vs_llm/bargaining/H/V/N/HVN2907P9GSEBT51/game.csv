550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that accounts for the 20% inflation penalty I face each round. If we continue to the next round, my money loses value while yours doesn't. This offer gives us both substantial value right now.",Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your point about the inflation penalty, but that's exactly why I should receive a larger share. Since your money loses 20% value each round and mine doesn't, the longer we negotiate, the worse it gets for you. This offer of $600000 for me and $400000 for you is fair considering our positions. Your $400000 now is better than a smaller amount later due to your inflation penalty.",Bob,2,

520000.0,480000.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. Yes, I face inflation, but that doesn't justify you taking such a large share. I've already reduced my request to account for the inflation pressure. This is a fair offer that recognizes both our positions - you get a substantial amount while I get enough to offset some of my inflation losses. Further delays will hurt both of us if we can't reach an agreement by the final round.",Alice,3,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I appreciate you moving toward a more balanced offer. I've also adjusted my position from my previous offer. Given that we're now in round 4 and your money has already lost 36% of its value, this split makes mathematical sense. Your $450000 now is worth more than potentially less later as inflation continues to affect your share. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our positions, and I'm willing to conclude our negotiation here to ensure we both walk away with substantial value.",Bob,4,
