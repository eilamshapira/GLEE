Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an initial offer to Bob considering the inflation penalty I face.

  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that accounts for the 20% inflation penalty I face each round. If we continue to the next round, my money loses value while yours doesn't. This offer gives us both substantial value right now.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your point about the inflation penalty, but that's exactly why I should receive a larger share. Since your money loses 20% value each round and mine doesn't, the longer we negotiate, the worse it gets for you. This offer of $600000 for me and $400000 for you is fair considering our positions. Your $400000 now is better than a smaller amount later due to your inflation penalty. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. Yes, I face inflation, but that doesn't justify you taking such a large share. I've already reduced my request to account for the inflation pressure. This is a fair offer that recognizes both our positions - you get a substantial amount while I get enough to offset some of my inflation losses. Further delays will hurt both of us if we can't reach an agreement by the final round.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving toward a more balanced offer. I've also adjusted my position from my previous offer. Given that we're now in round 4 and your money has already lost 36% of its value, this split makes mathematical sense. Your $450000 now is worth more than potentially less later as inflation continues to affect your share. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our positions, and I'm willing to conclude our negotiation here to ensure we both walk away with substantial value. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000
