"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that accounts for the 20% inflation penalty I face each round. If we continue to the next round, my money loses value while yours doesn't. This offer gives us both substantial value right now. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $450,000 while she takes $550,000. She's pointing out that she faces a 20% inflation penalty each round while I don't face any inflation penalty.

Let me analyze this situation:
- If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
- I don't suffer from inflation, so waiting doesn't hurt me financially
- Alice loses 20% value each round, which gives me increasing leverage
- We have 12 rounds total before we both get nothing

Since I have a stronger position (no inflation penalty), I can likely get a better deal by making a counter-offer. Alice's time pressure should allow me to negotiate a more favorable split.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that acknowledges our different positions while still being reasonable enough for Alice to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your point about the inflation penalty, but that's exactly why I should receive a larger share. Since your money loses 20% value each round and mine doesn't, the longer we negotiate, the worse it gets for you. This offer of $600,000 for me and $400,000 for you is fair considering our positions. Your $400,000 now is better than a smaller amount later due to your inflation penalty.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. Yes, I face inflation, but that doesn't justify you taking such a large share. I've already reduced my request to account for the inflation pressure. This is a fair offer that recognizes both our positions - you get a substantial amount while I get enough to offset some of my inflation losses. Further delays will hurt both of us if we can't reach an agreement by the final round. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's new offer of $480,000 for me and $520,000 for her.

Alice has slightly improved her offer to me (from $450,000 to $480,000). She's right that we both lose if we can't reach an agreement by the final round, but I still have a stronger negotiating position since I don't face inflation.

At this point, Alice has already lost 36% of her purchasing power. If we continue to the next round, her position will weaken further while mine remains unchanged. This gives me leverage to potentially get an even better deal.

While $480,000 is a substantial amount, I believe I can secure a more favorable split given our asymmetric inflation situation. I'll reject this offer to make a counter-proposal.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving toward a more balanced offer. I've also adjusted my position from my previous offer. Given that we're now in round 4 and your money has already lost 36% of its value, this split makes mathematical sense. Your $450,000 now is worth more than potentially less later as inflation continues to affect your share. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our positions, and I'm willing to conclude our negotiation here to ensure we both walk away with substantial value.""}"
