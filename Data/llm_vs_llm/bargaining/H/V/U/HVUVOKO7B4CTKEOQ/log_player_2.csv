"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Seems fair, right? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically:

1. Alice is offering a 50-50 split, which is traditionally considered fair
2. If I reject, we move to round 2 where:
   * I can make an offer
   * The total amount will be worth 5% less (9,500$)
   * I might be able to get more, but Alice could reject
3. This is a fair first offer with no loss to the total amount
4. There's risk in rejecting as future rounds will have less total value

Given this is a fair offer with maximum total value, I'll accept.
