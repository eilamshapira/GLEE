"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement quickly due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. Given that each round further devalues my share due to inflation, I'd like to propose a 50/50 split now so that we both secure a fair deal immediately. I believe this is in our mutual best interest. Looking forward to your response. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this... 

If I accept now:
- I get $50, but it's worth 20% less due to inflation, so effectively $40
- Bob gets $50, with only 5% inflation, so effectively $47.50

If I reject:
- Next round I can make an offer, but my share will be worth 40% less than original value
- Even if I ask for more, the declining value might make it worse than accepting now

Given the significant difference in our inflation rates and the fair 50-50 split offered, this is actually a reasonable deal. If I wait, my purchasing power will decrease more rapidly than Bob's.
