"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $50,000 while she gets $950,000, which is only 5% of the total for me.

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but I need to account for inflation. The money will be worth 20% less to me in the next round, so the effective total value for me would be $800,000. If I make a more balanced offer then, I could potentially get more than $50,000 even after accounting for inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer that accounts for our different inflation rates while still being attractive enough for Alice to accept.

Given that Alice faces 5% inflation per round, she still has an incentive to reach an agreement soon. I'll propose a more equitable split while acknowledging that I face higher inflation pressure.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing an equal 50-50 split of the money. This is fair and gives us both significant value. Since you face lower inflation (5%) than I do (20%), it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly rather than continuing to negotiate while the total value diminishes."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30000 
# Alice gain: 970000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate this offer. Alice has actually reduced her offer to me from $50,000 to $30,000, despite inflation affecting both of us. 

Due to my 36% inflation penalty, $30,000 now is worth even less to me than her initial offer. With inflation, $30,000 in this round is effectively worth only about $19,200 compared to round 1 value.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 4, I'll face 20% more inflation (about 49% total from round 1), which significantly reduces the value of any amount I might receive. Alice knows my inflation rate is much higher than hers, putting me at a disadvantage.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to make a strategic offer that Alice would accept, considering our asymmetric inflation rates and the bargaining dynamics.

{""bob_gain"": 350000, ""alice_gain"": 650000}

Alice, I'm proposing a split that acknowledges our different inflation rates. Since my inflation rate (20% per round) is much higher than yours (5% per round), continuing to negotiate hurts me significantly more than it hurts you. 

This offer gives you the larger share while still providing me with meaningful value. If we continue to the next round, the total pie becomes worth even less to both of us. Given that you'd face only minimal additional inflation while I'd lose substantially more value, this division represents a reasonable compromise that benefits us both by concluding the negotiation now."
