"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since money devalues faster for you (10% vs my 5% per round), this split actually helps us both reach a fair outcome when accounting for time value. Let's avoid multiple rounds of negotiation which would hurt us both. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Bob, I understand your point about inflation, but your offer still seems unfair considering the initial value. Let's try to find a middle ground that accounts for the devaluation but remains equitable.""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
