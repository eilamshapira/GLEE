"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair and split it 50-50. What do you say, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice has offered a 50-50 split ($500,000 each). While this appears fair on the surface, I need to consider:

1. I get to make the next offer if I reject
2. Money loses value faster for Alice (10% per round) than for me (5% per round)
3. This differential in value decay gives me some negotiating leverage

Since this is the first round and I have minimal value decay so far, I could potentially get a better deal by making a counter-offer. With Alice's steeper value decay rate, she may be more inclined to accept a less equal split in later rounds.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that money devalues faster for Alice than for me, I'll propose a split slightly in my favor, but not too aggressive to avoid multiple rounds of negotiation which would hurt us both.

{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Since money devalues faster for you (10% vs my 5% per round), this split actually helps us both reach a fair outcome when accounting for time value. Let's avoid multiple rounds of negotiation which would hurt us both.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering the inflation rates, I propose we split it 45-55 in your favor. This way, we both get a fair share adjusted for the devaluation. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $550,000 (55%) and taking $450,000 (45%)
2. Due to inflation:
   * My $550,000 is worth about $496,375 (after 9.75% devaluation)
   * Alice's $450,000 is worth about $364,500 (after 19% devaluation)
3. This is actually a worse deal for me than her initial 50-50 offer
4. However, if I reject:
   * Next round will have even more devaluation
   * We're already in round 3 of 12
   * The risk of continued negotiation could lead to worse outcomes for both

Given that Alice has shown willingness to negotiate and the increasing risk of further devaluation, this offer is reasonable enough to accept.
