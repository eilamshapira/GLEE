"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob! How about I take $5500 and you take $4500? Seems like a fair start. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice is offering me $4500 out of $10,000
2. If I reject, we go to the next round where I can make an offer
3. However, due to 10% inflation for me (not Alice), my money will be worth less in the next round
4. $4500 now is better than $5000 in the next round (which would be worth $4500 due to inflation)
5. This is actually a reasonable first offer considering the inflation penalty I face
