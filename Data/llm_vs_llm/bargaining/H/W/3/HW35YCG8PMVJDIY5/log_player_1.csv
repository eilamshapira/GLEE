"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a split that considers both our interests and the different inflation rates we face. Since Bob faces higher inflation (20% vs my 10% per round), he has more incentive to accept an early offer.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, giving me $600,000 and Bob $400,000. This is fair considering that I face less inflation pressure and thus have more leverage to wait, but I'm still offering Bob a substantial amount to incentivize early acceptance."
