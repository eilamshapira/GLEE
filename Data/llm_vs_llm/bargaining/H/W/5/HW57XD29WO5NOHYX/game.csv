800000.0,200000.0,"Alice, consider this: if you reject, you'll get to propose in round 5—but due to inflation your money will drop to about 40.96% of its face value. This means you'd effectively secure around $409600. With this offer, you get $800000 face value in round 4, which, after the inflation factor of 51.2%, equals exactly that amount. It's your best option given the inflation hit—please accept.",Bob,4,
