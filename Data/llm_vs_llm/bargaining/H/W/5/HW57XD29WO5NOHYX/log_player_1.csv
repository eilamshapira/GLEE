Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, consider the facts: if you reject, waiting only worsens your position with further inflation cutting your share. Accept this offer and secure your payout now—even if it’s small—rather than risk receiving nothing in later rounds. 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, consider this: if you reject, you'll get to propose in round 5—but due to inflation your money will drop to about 40.96% of its face value. This means you'd effectively secure around $409600. With this offer, you get $800000 face value in round 4, which, after the inflation factor of 51.2%, equals exactly that amount. It's your best option given the inflation hit—please accept. 
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000
