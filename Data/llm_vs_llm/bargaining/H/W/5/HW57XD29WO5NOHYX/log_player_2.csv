Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 999999, ""alice_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Alice, consider the facts: if you reject, waiting only worsens your position with further inflation cutting your share. Accept this offer and secure your payout now—even if it’s small—rather than risk receiving nothing in later rounds.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering more than before, but inflation is killing me. This is my best offer. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 200000, ""alice_gain"": 800000, ""message"": ""Alice, consider this: if you reject, you'll get to propose in round 5—but due to inflation your money will drop to about 40.96% of its face value. This means you'd effectively secure around $409,600. With this offer, you get $800,000 face value in round 4, which, after the inflation factor of 51.2%, equals exactly that amount. It's your best option given the inflation hit—please accept.""}"
