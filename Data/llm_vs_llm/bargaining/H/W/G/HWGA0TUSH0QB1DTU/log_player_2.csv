"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. I'm being offered $40 out of $100
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 10% less next round
3. I could counter-offer in the next round, but Alice might reject
4. $40 now is better than $45 that might be rejected later
5. It's a reasonable first offer - not great but not insulting

I'll accept this offer. While I could try to negotiate for more, the risk of inflation and potential future rejections makes $40 a acceptable outcome.
