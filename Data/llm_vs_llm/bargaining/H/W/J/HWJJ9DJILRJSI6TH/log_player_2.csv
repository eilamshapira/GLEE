Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, to avoid further depreciation losses, I propose we split the $10000 such that I receive $5556 and you get $4444. This offer reflects our future opportunity costs, so accepting now secures a fair share for both of us. What do you think?

# Alice gain: 5556 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
