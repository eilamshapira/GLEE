"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair offer considering we both want to maximize our gains, but I also need to account for the 5% inflation loss in each round.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and you get $45. This is a reasonable split that gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging that if we move to another round, I'll lose value due to inflation."
