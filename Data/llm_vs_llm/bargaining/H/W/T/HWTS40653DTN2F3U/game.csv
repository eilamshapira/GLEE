60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm affected by inflation while you're not. This way we both get a fair value considering the depreciation of my share over time.",Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, since you face 20% inflation per round, it's in your interest to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. I'm offering you $45 now, which is worth more to you than $60 would be after several rounds of negotiation. This is a fair compromise considering we both want to maximize our gains.",Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"Bob, I appreciate your consideration of the inflation factor. I'm reducing my request to 55-45, which is a more balanced split. This way we can both walk away with a good outcome, and I avoid further inflation penalties. Please consider accepting so we can conclude this positively.",Alice,3,
