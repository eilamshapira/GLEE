"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm affected by inflation while you're not. This way we both get a fair value considering the depreciation of my share over time.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, since you face 20% inflation per round, it's in your interest to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. I'm offering you $45 now, which is worth more to you than $60 would be after several rounds of negotiation. This is a fair compromise considering we both want to maximize our gains. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer because even with 20% inflation, I can still propose a better split for myself in the next round. The inflation penalty isn't severe enough yet to make $45 the best option, especially since Bob is showing willingness to negotiate and understands the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your consideration of the inflation factor. I'm reducing my request to 55-45, which is a more balanced split. This way we can both walk away with a good outcome, and I avoid further inflation penalties. Please consider accepting so we can conclude this positively.""}"
