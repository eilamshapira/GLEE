"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm affected by inflation while you're not. This way we both get a fair value considering the depreciation of my share over time. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is correct that she faces 20% inflation per round while I don't face any inflation. However, if I reject now, I can make a counter-offer in round 2, where Alice's money will already be worth 20% less to her.

Since we're in round 1, Alice's $60 is still worth the full value to her, while my $40 is also worth the full value to me. If I reject and propose a more favorable split next round, Alice might be more willing to accept due to the inflation penalty she faces.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I should offer Alice a reasonable deal that accounts for her inflation penalty but is more favorable to me than her initial offer.

{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, since you face 20% inflation per round, it's in your interest to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. I'm offering you $45 now, which is worth more to you than $60 would be after several rounds of negotiation. This is a fair compromise considering we both want to maximize our gains.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your consideration of the inflation factor. I'm reducing my request to 55-45, which is a more balanced split. This way we can both walk away with a good outcome, and I avoid further inflation penalties. Please consider accepting so we can conclude this positively. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this new offer carefully. Alice has reduced her request from 60-40 to 55-45, offering me $45 instead of $40.

Due to inflation, Alice's $55 is now worth only about $35.20 to her (after 36% inflation), while my $45 has full value. If I reject now, in the next round Alice will face 20% more inflation (about 49% total), making any amount worth even less to her.

Since Alice has moved in my direction and the offer is reasonable considering her inflation disadvantage, I'll accept this offer.
