"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a division that considers both our interests, keeping in mind that delays affect me more negatively (10% vs 5% depreciation).

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which I believe is fair considering I'm making the first move and we both benefit from reaching an early agreement. This gives Bob a substantial share while recognizing my position as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Due to 10% inflation for me, $450,000 is now worth $405,000 in round 1 terms
2. If I reject and propose in the next round, even if I get a larger share, it will be worth even less due to the 10% depreciation
3. Bob's offer gives me 45% of the total, which isn't too far from a fair split
4. Waiting another round would mean more value loss, and Bob might be even less generous

Given these factors, especially the higher inflation rate affecting my gains, I should accept this offer now rather than risk further depreciation.
