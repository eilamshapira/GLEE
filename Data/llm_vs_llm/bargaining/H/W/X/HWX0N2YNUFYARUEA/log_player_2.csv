"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer gives me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000, which is 40% of the total. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, I need to consider that the total value will decrease by 5% for me and 10% for Alice.

If I reject, the $1,000,000 will be worth $950,000 to me and $900,000 to Alice in the next round. I could potentially negotiate for a better split, but I risk further devaluation if we continue negotiating.

Since Alice is experiencing a higher inflation rate (10% vs my 5%), I have a strategic advantage by rejecting and making a counter-offer where I can claim a larger share.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a division that accounts for our different inflation rates and tries to reach a fair compromise.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'd like to propose this split considering our different inflation rates. Since we're both facing depreciation with each round (yours at 10% is higher than mine at 5%), I think this is a fair division that gives us both a substantial portion while avoiding further rounds of negotiations where we'd both lose value."
