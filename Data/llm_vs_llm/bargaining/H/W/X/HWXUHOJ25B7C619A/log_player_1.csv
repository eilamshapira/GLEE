"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a division that takes into account that Bob's money will be worth 10% less each round if he refuses. Since I know he's rational, he should accept a fair offer now rather than risk getting less value later.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because it's relatively fair while giving me a slight advantage. If Bob refuses, in the next round his share will effectively be worth 10% less to him, so he has an incentive to accept now rather than risk getting a worse deal later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 505000 
# Bob gain: 495000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Bob offered me $505,000, which is less than my initial offer but still a good portion.
2. If I reject, we go to round 3 where I can make another offer.
3. However, in round 3, Bob's portion will be worth another 10% less to him, so he'll be even more motivated to accept.
4. But there's also risk - Bob might then make an even lower offer to me in round 4.
5. $505,000 is a good outcome for me - it's more than half the total amount.

Given these factors, I'll accept this offer. It's a solid deal, and continuing might lead to more uncertainty.
