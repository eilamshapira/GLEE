"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose we split the money 55/45, with me getting the larger share. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's offer considering the inflation effect.

If I accept now, I get $45.
If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, my money will be worth 5% less. So whatever amount I'd get in the next round would effectively be multiplied by 0.95.

Since Alice's offer gives me a reasonable portion and waiting would reduce the value of my money, I should consider accepting this offer now.
