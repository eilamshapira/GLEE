"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 50-50 split. Given the inflation risk, this ensures we both come away with a fair amount. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 20% inflation, if I accept Bob's $50 offer now, it's effectively worth $40 to me (50 * 0.8).

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, any amount I receive will be worth another 20% less. So I'd need to get significantly more than $50 to make up for the inflation loss.

Given this, accepting $50 now (worth $40 after inflation) is better than risking another round of inflation for a potentially higher nominal amount.
