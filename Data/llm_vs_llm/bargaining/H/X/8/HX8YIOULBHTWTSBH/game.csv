6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get your money immediately without any inflation impact.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, let's start with a slightly better offer for me, 55-45. This is still a good deal for you, and we can avoid losing money to inflation. Let's agree now!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
7000.0,3000.0,"Bob, I need to increase my share to 70-30 because I'm losing 20% to inflation each round. My 7000 is actually worth only 5600 to me now due to two rounds of inflation. This is still fair for both of us - please consider accepting so we don't lose more to inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. Let's try a 60-40 split in my favor. Given the inflation, this should give you more real value compared to your initial offer. Let's avoid further losses and finalize this deal.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
8000.0,2000.0,"Bob, due to compounding inflation, I'm now losing 48.8% of my share's value. My $8000 is actually only worth about $4096 to me now. Your $2000 maintains its full value. This split is fair when accounting for inflation - please accept so we can both benefit before inflation reduces the value further.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
3500.0,6500.0,"Alice, the inflation is hurting us both! I'm offering a 65-35 split for me, which gives you $3500. Considering the inflation, this should be a reasonable amount for you in real value. Let's stop the losses and make a deal now.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
9000.0,1000.0,"Bob, please understand that with 67.23% inflation, even this 90-10 split gives me only about $2950 in real value (9000 * 0.3277), while your $1000 keeps its full value. We need to reach an agreement soon, or we'll both get nothing. This split actually gives us similar real values when accounting for inflation.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"Alice, I understand the impact of inflation. Let's try a 70-30 split in my favour. I get $7000 and you get $3000. Given the rapidly increasing inflation affecting your gains, this might be a reasonable offer for you if you calculate the actual worth of the money you will receive. We are running out of rounds and time. Let's close this deal quickly.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
9500.0,500.0,"Bob, with 79.03% inflation, my $9500 is worth only $1992 in real value to me (9500 * 0.2097), while your $500 maintains full value. This is actually a fair split in real terms. We only have 3 rounds left before we both get nothing - please accept this offer so we can both walk away with something worthwhile.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
2000.0,8000.0,"Alice, we are almost out of time! The inflation is killing us. I offer you $2000. I know it's not much, but it's better than nothing. Please consider this. I get $8000.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
9800.0,200.0,"Bob, this is our second-to-last chance. With 86.58% inflation, my $9800 is only worth $1315 in real value to me (9800 * 0.1342), while your $200 keeps its full value. If we don't agree now or in the next round, we both get NOTHING. Please accept this offer - it's actually quite balanced when accounting for inflation, and far better than zero for both of us.",Alice,11,
