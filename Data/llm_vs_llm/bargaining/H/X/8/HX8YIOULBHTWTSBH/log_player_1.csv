"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get your money immediately without any inflation impact.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's start with a slightly better offer for me, 55-45. This is still a good deal for you, and we can avoid losing money to inflation. Let's agree now! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer since I know my money is already worth 20% less in this round, so my real gain would only be 3600$ (4500$ - 20%). I'll make a counter-offer in the next round that accounts for inflation."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7000, 
""bob_gain"": 3000, 
""message"": ""Bob, I need to increase my share to 70-30 because I'm losing 20% to inflation each round. My 7000 is actually worth only 5600 to me now due to two rounds of inflation. This is still fair for both of us - please consider accepting so we don't lose more to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. Let's try a 60-40 split in my favor. Given the inflation, this should give you more real value compared to your initial offer. Let's avoid further losses and finalize this deal. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

With 48.8% inflation, my $4000 would only be worth about $2048 in real terms. This is far too low compared to Bob's $6000 which isn't affected by inflation. I'll make a counter-offer that better accounts for the increasing inflation impact."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 8000, 
""bob_gain"": 2000, 
""message"": ""Bob, due to compounding inflation, I'm now losing 48.8% of my share's value. My $8000 is actually only worth about $4096 to me now. Your $2000 maintains its full value. This split is fair when accounting for inflation - please accept so we can both benefit before inflation reduces the value further.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the inflation is hurting us both! I'm offering a 65-35 split for me, which gives you $3500. Considering the inflation, this should be a reasonable amount for you in real value. Let's stop the losses and make a deal now. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

With 67.23% inflation, my $3500 would only be worth about $1147 in real terms, while Bob gets $6500 at full value. This is extremely unfair given the inflation impact. I need to propose a much larger nominal amount to compensate for the severe inflation effect."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 9000, 
""bob_gain"": 1000, 
""message"": ""Bob, please understand that with 67.23% inflation, even this 90-10 split gives me only about $2950 in real value (9000 * 0.3277), while your $1000 keeps its full value. We need to reach an agreement soon, or we'll both get nothing. This split actually gives us similar real values when accounting for inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the impact of inflation. Let's try a 70-30 split in my favour. I get $7000 and you get $3000. Given the rapidly increasing inflation affecting your gains, this might be a reasonable offer for you if you calculate the actual worth of the money you will receive. We are running out of rounds and time. Let's close this deal quickly. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

With 79.03% inflation, my $3000 would only be worth about $629 in real terms (3000 * 0.2097), while Bob gets $7000 at full value. The difference is too extreme. We have 4 rounds left, and I need to keep negotiating for a much larger nominal amount to offset this severe inflation impact."

Round 9

We only have 3 rounds left before we both get nothing - please accept this offer so we can both walk away with something worthwhile.""}"

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we are almost out of time! The inflation is killing us. I offer you $2000. I know it's not much, but it's better than nothing. Please consider this. I get $8000. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

With 86.58% inflation, my $2000 would only be worth about $268 in real terms (2000 * 0.1342), while Bob gets $8000 at full value. This is extremely unfair. We have 2 rounds left, and even though we risk getting nothing, I need to try for a better deal that accounts for this devastating inflation impact."

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 9800, 
""bob_gain"": 200, 
""message"": ""Bob, this is our second-to-last chance. With 86.58% inflation, my $9800 is only worth $1315 in real value to me (9800 * 0.1342), while your $200 keeps its full value. If we don't agree now or in the next round, we both get NOTHING. Please accept this offer - it's actually quite balanced when accounting for inflation, and far better than zero for both of us.""}"
