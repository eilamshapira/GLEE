"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
* The offer is a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
* However, if I reject, I can make my own offer next round
* The inflation penalty means my $500,000 would be worth $400,000 if I wait one round
* I'd need to get at least $625,000 next round to beat what I can get now ($500,000)
* There's no guarantee Alice would accept a higher offer from me

Given the significant inflation penalty and the risk of getting nothing if we can't agree, this seems like a reasonable offer.
