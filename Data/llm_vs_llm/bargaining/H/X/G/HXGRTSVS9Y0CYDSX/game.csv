52.0,48.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a nearly equal split that slightly favors me since you have a discount rate and I don't. If we go to the next round, your money will be worth less. This is a fair offer that gives us both substantial value right away.",Alice,1,

48.0,52.0,"Hi Alice, thanks for your previous offer. I understand your reasoning, but I believe a slightly better split favoring me is more reflective of the decreasing value over time.  Let's settle this quickly and efficiently.",Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"Bob, I'm increasing my share slightly because you rejected my fair first offer. Remember that each round your money loses 5% value - your $45 now is worth more than $52 would be in round 5. Let's settle this now before inflation erodes your gains further.",Alice,3,

50.0,50.0,"Alice, this back and forth isn't productive. We both lose if this drags out. A 50/50 split is fair and avoids further losses from inflation. Let's agree and move on.",Bob,4,
