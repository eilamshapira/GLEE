"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I want to propose a fair division that takes into account our different discount rates.

{""alice_gain"": 52,
""bob_gain"": 48,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a nearly equal split that slightly favors me since you have a discount rate and I don't. If we go to the next round, your money will be worth less. This is a fair offer that gives us both substantial value right away.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your previous offer. I understand your reasoning, but I believe a slightly better split favoring me is more reflective of the decreasing value over time.  Let's settle this quickly and efficiently. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm increasing my share slightly because you rejected my fair first offer. Remember that each round your money loses 5% value - your $45 now is worth more than $52 would be in round 5. Let's settle this now before inflation erodes your gains further.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this back and forth isn't productive. We both lose if this drags out. A 50/50 split is fair and avoids further losses from inflation. Let's agree and move on. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
