"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a nearly equal split that slightly favors me since you have a discount rate and I don't. If we go to the next round, your money will be worth less. This is a fair offer that gives us both substantial value right away. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your previous offer. I understand your reasoning, but I believe a slightly better split favoring me is more reflective of the decreasing value over time.  Let's settle this quickly and efficiently.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm increasing my share slightly because you rejected my fair first offer. Remember that each round your money loses 5% value - your $45 now is worth more than $52 would be in round 5. Let's settle this now before inflation erodes your gains further. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, this back and forth isn't productive. We both lose if this drags out. A 50/50 split is fair and avoids further losses from inflation. Let's agree and move on.""}"
