"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split where I get slightly more as the first mover. This is a reasonable offer that benefits us both.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a fair and equal split. We can adjust later if we need to. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. The offer appears to be a 50-50 split
2. However, due to 20% inflation on Bob's side, if he gets $50, it's actually worth less to him
3. This means he might be more eager to make a deal now
4. We have 10 more rounds possible, but continuing risks further inflation for Bob
5. From my perspective, $50 is still worth $50 (no inflation for me)
6. While I could try to negotiate for more, this is a reasonable offer and guarantees me a good amount
