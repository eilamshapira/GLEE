Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be fair and practical. I'm offering a 52-48 split which is very reasonable. If we keep rejecting offers, inflation will eat into our gains. Let's make a deal now. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

I'm rejecting this offer. While it's closer to a reasonable split, I believe I can still get a better deal. Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation as well."
