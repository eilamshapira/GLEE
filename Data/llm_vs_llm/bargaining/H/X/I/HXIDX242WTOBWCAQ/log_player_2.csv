"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this extremely unfair offer where I would only receive $1 while Alice takes virtually the entire sum. I will make a counter-proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose a perfectly fair 50-50 split, where we each receive $500,000. This is the most equitable solution that benefits us both equally."
