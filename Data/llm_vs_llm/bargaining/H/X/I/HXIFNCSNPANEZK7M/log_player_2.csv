Explanation: I'm offering Alice $5500, which is $500 more than her previous offer, and keeping $4500 for myself. This is a fair increase for Alice, and considering the inflation affecting me, it's important to find a middle ground soon."

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000}
