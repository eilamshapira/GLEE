"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split, considering that I need to make it attractive enough for Bob to accept since inflation will hurt my gains if we continue to further rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split because it's close to equal but gives me a slight advantage, which is reasonable since I'm making the first offer. If Bob rejects, my next opportunity will be worth 20% less to me, so I'm motivated to make a reasonable offer now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept now, I get $4500, but due to 20% inflation, it's only worth $3600 to me
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount will be worth even less (40% less than original value)
3. Bob's previous rejection of my 5500/4500 split shows he wants more than 4500
4. Given the asymmetric inflation (20% for me vs 10% for Bob), Bob has a stronger negotiating position

Even though this isn't ideal, the inflation penalty makes it better to accept now than to continue negotiating.
