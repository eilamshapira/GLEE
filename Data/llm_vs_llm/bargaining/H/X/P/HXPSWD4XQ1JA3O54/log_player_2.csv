"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Since the value of money is decreasing on your side, let's meet in the middle. 55 for me and 45 for you. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is getting worse for me with each round due to inflation.  I need to push for a better split soon, but I don't want to seem completely unreasonable."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, it's clear we both want a decent share.  Let's stop wasting time with the back and forth.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit before inflation eats away at the value any further.""}"
