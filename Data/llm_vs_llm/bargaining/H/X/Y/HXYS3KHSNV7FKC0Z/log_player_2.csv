"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest we split the money equally. This way we both get the same amount and can finish the game right away without losing value to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Alice's offer for an equal 50-50 split of the $100.

This is a fair opening offer that would give us both $50. If I reject and we go to the next round, the total value decreases by 20% to $80. Even if I proposed a more favorable split for myself in round 2, the maximum I could get (if Alice accepts) would be less than $80.

Given that:
- This is a fair split
- The money loses 20% value each round
- There's risk in continuing
