"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to make an offer that Bob is likely to accept, considering the decreasing value of the money for both of us. I need to be somewhat generous to ensure he accepts, but also maximize my own gain.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

My reasoning:

*   I'm starting with a slight advantage for myself (60/40 split).
*   This gives Bob a significant portion (40$) upfront which is likely more attractive than risking further devaluation.
*   The devaluation is more severe for me (20% per round) than for Bob (5% per round). This initial offer should seem relatively reasonable to him given this difference."
