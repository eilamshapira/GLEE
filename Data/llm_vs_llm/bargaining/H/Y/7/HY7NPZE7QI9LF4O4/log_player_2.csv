"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering a split where she gets 60% ($600,000) and I get 40% ($400,000). 

Let me think strategically. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round. However, while the money has the same value to me in every round, it's worth 20% less to Alice in each round. This gives me negotiating leverage.

If I reject now, Alice will only value her $600,000 at $480,000 in the next round (80% of original value). This means I could potentially offer her less in the next round and she might still accept.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice faces a 20% depreciation per round, I can propose a more favorable split for myself while still giving her an offer that's more valuable to her now than waiting would be.

I'll offer a 55%-45% split in my favor, which gives Alice $450,000. This is less than her original offer of $600,000, but $450,000 now is worth more to her than $600,000 would be in the next round (which would only be worth $480,000 to her due to the 20% depreciation).

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has counteroffered with $450,000 for me and $550,000 for herself. 

Let me evaluate this. Alice's money is now worth 36% less than in round 1, meaning the $550,000 she's asking for is only worth about $352,000 to her in round 1 terms.

If I reject, we move to round 4, where her money will be worth 48.8% less than round 1 (an additional 20% decrease). That means if I offer her the same $550,000 in the next round, it would only be worth about $281,600 to her in round 1 terms.

This gives me leverage to potentially get a better deal by rejecting. However, I should be careful not to push too hard and risk getting nothing.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since we're now in round 4, Alice's money has depreciated further. I'll make an offer that's more favorable to me while still being reasonable for Alice to accept given her depreciation.

At this point, Alice faces a 48.8% depreciation from round 1, and if she rejects this offer, she'll face about a 59% depreciation in the next round. I'll use this to propose a split that gives me a larger share while still making it rational for her to accept.

""alice_gain"": 400000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has offered a 50-50 split: $500,000 for each of us.

Let me analyze this: Alice's money is now worth 59.04% less than in round 1, so her $500,000 is only worth about $204,800 to her in round 1 terms.

If I reject and we move to round 6, her money will be worth 67.23% less than round 1 (an additional 20% decrease). This means if I were to offer her $500,000 in the next round, it would only be worth about $163,850 to her in round 1 terms.

While I could potentially get a better deal by rejecting, Alice's offer is fairly reasonable given the circumstances. A 50-50 split is equitable in nominal terms, and I've already gained significant leverage due to her depreciation. Further rounds risk prolonging negotiations unnecessarily.
