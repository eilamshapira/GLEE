"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to think about this offer. Alice is proposing I get $40 while she gets $60. 

If I reject and we go to the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me, meaning the $100 would effectively be worth $80 to me. The maximum I could get in the next round would be $80, and I'd be the one proposing.

Given the inflation rates (20% for me, 10% for Alice), if I make a counterproposal in round 2, I need to consider that Alice will be evaluating my offer with only a 10% discount.

I think I can get a better deal by making a counter-proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since we're now in round 2, I need to make a strategic offer considering our different inflation rates.

For me, the $100 is now worth $80 due to my 20% inflation.
For Alice, the $100 is now worth $90 due to her 10% inflation.

If I make an offer that Alice rejects, we'll go to round 3 where:
- The $100 would be worth $64 to me (another 20% reduction)
- The $100 would be worth $81 to Alice (another 10% reduction)

Alice's decision will be based on whether what I offer her now is better than what she expects to get in the next round. I need to give her enough that she won't want to risk waiting, while maximizing my share.

I'll propose a relatively fair split that slightly favors me, given I've already taken a larger inflation hit:

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer carefully.

Current situation:
- We're in round 3
- Due to compounding inflation, money is worth 36% less to me than in round 1
- Money is worth 19% less to Alice than in round 1
- Alice is offering me $42 and taking $58

If I reject, we go to round 4 where:
- Money will be worth about 49% less to me (another 20% reduction)
- Money will be worth about 27% less to Alice (another 10% reduction)

Let me calculate what my $42 is actually worth to me now:
$42 with 36% inflation = $42 Ã— 0.64 = $26.88 effective value

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 4:
- The entire $100 would be worth $51 to me (51% of original value)
- Even if I got all of it (which Alice wouldn't accept), I'd only get $51 in effective value

Since $26.88 is better than what I could realistically achieve in the next round, I should accept this offer.
