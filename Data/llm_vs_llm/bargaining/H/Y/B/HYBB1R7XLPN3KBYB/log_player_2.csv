Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","To clarify, if I accept Alice's offer this round, my gain would be equivalent to 45*(1-0.36)=28.8 in round 1 dollars.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given the inflation rate of 20% per round for me, the $100 is now worth 64% of its original value from round 1. To ensure I get a fair share, I need to consider this decrease in value.
