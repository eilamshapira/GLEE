,,,Bob,1,reject
285713.0,714287.0,"Alice, I value our time—and given the inflation differences (10% for me, 20% for you per round), delaying the agreement will hurt you more. If you reject and become proposer in round 3, your best outcome (using standard bargaining reasoning) would net you roughly $228570 in real terms. To match that in round 2 (with your 20% discount, i.e. a multiplier of 0.8), you’d need about $285713 nominal. Therefore, I propose the split: I receive $714287 and you receive $285713. I believe this is a fair offer that rewards prompt agreement. What do you say?",Bob,2,
