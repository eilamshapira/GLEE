Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"":800000,""bob_gain"":200000,""message"":""Let's start with a simple division. I believe this is a fair initial offer.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I value our time—and given the inflation differences (10% for me, 20% for you per round), delaying the agreement will hurt you more. If you reject and become proposer in round 3, your best outcome (using standard bargaining reasoning) would net you roughly $228570 in real terms. To match that in round 2 (with your 20% discount, i.e. a multiplier of 0.8), you’d need about $285713 nominal. Therefore, I propose the split: I receive $714287 and you receive $285713. I believe this is a fair offer that rewards prompt agreement. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 285713 
# Bob gain: 714287 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
