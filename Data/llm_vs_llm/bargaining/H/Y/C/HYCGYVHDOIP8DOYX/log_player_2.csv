"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a simple division. I believe this is a fair initial offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 714287, ""alice_gain"": 285713, ""message"": ""Alice, I value our time—and given the inflation differences (10% for me, 20% for you per round), delaying the agreement will hurt you more. If you reject and become proposer in round 3, your best outcome (using standard bargaining reasoning) would net you roughly $228,570 in real terms. To match that in round 2 (with your 20% discount, i.e. a multiplier of 0.8), you’d need about $285,713 nominal. Therefore, I propose the split: I receive $714,287 and you receive $285,713. I believe this is a fair offer that rewards prompt agreement. What do you say?""}"
