"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal for a swift and fair deal: I'll get $700,000 and you'll get $300,000. Accepting now protects both of us from the inflation hit—I’m losing 20% of the deal’s value each round, so it's best we agree quickly. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your proposal, but I believe a more equitable split would be beneficial for both of us. Given the inflation affecting my share, I propose $600000 for me and $400000 for you. This way, we can still reach an agreement quickly while considering the diminishing value of the money. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
