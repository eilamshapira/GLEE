"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal for a swift and fair deal: I'll get $700000 and you'll get $300000. Accepting now protects both of us from the inflation hit—I’m losing 20% of the deal’s value each round, so it's best we agree quickly. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000

  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your proposal, but I believe a more equitable split would be beneficial for both of us. Given the inflation affecting my share, I propose $600,000 for me and $400,000 for you. This way, we can still reach an agreement quickly while considering the diminishing value of the money. What do you say?""
