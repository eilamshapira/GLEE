"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer:

Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which is perfectly fair. Since there's no inflation for me (the money is worth 0% less each round), there's no strategic advantage in rejecting and making a counter-offer. A fair split now is as good as a fair split later.
