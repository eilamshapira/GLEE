"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let me make a fair offer considering the inflation rates.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest we split the money slightly in my favor since I face higher inflation (20% vs your 10%). This way we both benefit by resolving quickly, and I'm accounting for the different inflation rates we face. It's a reasonable division that respects both our interests."
