"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to think about Alice's offer carefully. She proposed that I get $45 while she gets $55 of the $100.

If I reject, we go to the next round where I can make a counter-offer, but inflation will reduce the value - for me by 10% and for Alice by 20%. That means in the next round, we'd be dividing what's effectively worth $90 to me and $80 to Alice.

Given this asymmetric inflation rate, it makes strategic sense to consider accepting a reasonable first offer rather than dragging out negotiations, since Alice's money loses value faster than mine.

The $45/$55 split is reasonably close to 50/50, and if I reject to make a counter-offer, Alice might reject my next proposal anyway, leading to further depreciation for both of us.
