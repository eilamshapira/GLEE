60.0,40.0,"Bob, let's start with a fair offer. I propose 60 for me and 40 for you. This is a good starting point given the looming inflation.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
50.0,50.0,"Alice, I appreciate your opening offer, but since I'm not affected by inflation, I believe a 50-50 split would be more fair. This is the most equitable division, and we can avoid prolonging negotiations.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
65.0,35.0,"Bob, with inflation hitting me, 50-50 won't work. I'm offering 65 for me and 35 for you. It's a slightly better offer considering my losses. Let's close this deal!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
55.0,45.0,"Alice, I understand inflation is affecting you. Let's be strategic here - I propose $55 for you and $45 for me. With the current 19% inflation, your $55 is worth about $44.55 to you, making this split fairly even in real value. This is a balanced offer that accounts for your inflation concerns while still being fair to both of us.",Bob,4,
