"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your opening offer, but since I'm not affected by inflation, I believe a 50-50 split would be more fair. This is the most equitable division, and we can avoid prolonging negotiations. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand inflation is affecting you. Let's be strategic here - I propose $55 for you and $45 for me. With the current 19% inflation, your $55 is worth about $44.55 to you, making this split fairly even in real value. This is a balanced offer that accounts for your inflation concerns while still being fair to both of us. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45
