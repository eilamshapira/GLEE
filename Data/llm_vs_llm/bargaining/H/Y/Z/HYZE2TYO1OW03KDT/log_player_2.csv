"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's start with a fair offer. I propose 60 for me and 40 for you. This is a good starting point given the looming inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $40 while she gets $60. While this isn't an equal split, I should consider that:

1. I don't face any inflation pressure, so my $40 value won't decrease
2. If I reject, there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in future rounds
3. We only have 12 rounds total, and failing to reach an agreement means we both get nothing
4. It's a reasonable first offer, not an extreme lowball

However, since I'm not affected by inflation and this is just the first round, I think I can try to negotiate for a better split. I'll reject this offer and make my own proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split, but with a reasonable explanation.

{""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your opening offer, but since I'm not affected by inflation, I believe a 50-50 split would be more fair. This is the most equitable division, and we can avoid prolonging negotiations.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, with inflation hitting me, 50-50 won't work. I'm offering 65 for me and 35 for you. It's a slightly better offer considering my losses. Let's close this deal! 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze Alice's new offer:

1. She's now asking for $65, offering me $35
2. She claims inflation is affecting her (19% less value for her)
3. Her $65 with 19% inflation is actually worth about $52.65 to her
4. My $35 remains worth $35 since I'm not affected by inflation
5. This is actually a worse offer for me than her first offer ($40)
6. We still have 9 rounds left, but time pressure is increasing

Given that this offer is worse than her first offer, and my $35 would be less than what her inflation-adjusted portion would be worth, I'll reject and try to negotiate better terms.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Given that Alice is affected by inflation (which I now know is 19%), I'll make an offer that accounts for this while still being fair to me.

{""bob_gain"": 45,
""alice_gain"": 55,
""message"": ""Alice, I understand inflation is affecting you. Let's be strategic here - I propose $55 for you and $45 for me. With the current 19% inflation, your $55 is worth about $44.55 to you, making this split fairly even in real value. This is a balanced offer that accounts for your inflation concerns while still being fair to both of us.""}"
