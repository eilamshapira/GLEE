50.0,50.0,"Hi Bob, I propose a fair and swift resolution by splitting $100 equally: $50 for you and $50 for me. Let's secure our gains before any round-related effects kick in. What do you say?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Alice, I understand your desire for a fair split, but considering the inflation effect on me, I'd like to propose $55 for me and $45 for you. This way, we can both still benefit from an early resolution.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, I appreciate your proposal, but I believe we can reach a more balanced agreement. I'm going to pass on this offer and look forward to making a proposal in Round 3 that benefits us both even better.",Alice,2,reject
38.0,62.0,"Bob, taking into account the further inflation for your share in this round, I’m proposing a division where you receive $62 and I receive $38. This gives you a real value of about $49.6 now, which is competitive compared to your previous proposal and better than what you’d likely secure in later rounds with even steeper inflation. I believe this is a fair and strategic move for both of us—let’s lock it in now before conditions worsen further for you.",Alice,3,
