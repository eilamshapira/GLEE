"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a fair and swift resolution by splitting $100 equally: $50 for you and $50 for me. Let's secure our gains before any round-related effects kick in. What do you say?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire for a fair split, but considering the inflation effect on me, I'd like to propose $55 for me and $45 for you. This way, we can both still benefit from an early resolution. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your proposal, but I believe we can reach a more balanced agreement. I'm going to pass on this offer and look forward to making a proposal in Round 3 that benefits us both even better.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 38, ""bob_gain"": 62, ""message"": ""Bob, taking into account the further inflation for your share in this round, I’m proposing a division where you receive $62 and I receive $38. This gives you a real value of about $49.6 now, which is competitive compared to your previous proposal and better than what you’d likely secure in later rounds with even steeper inflation. I believe this is a fair and strategic move for both of us—let’s lock it in now before conditions worsen further for you.""}"
