"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a fair and swift resolution by splitting $100 equally: $50 for you and $50 for me. Let's secure our gains before any round-related effects kick in. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your desire for a fair split, but considering the inflation effect on me, I'd like to propose $55 for me and $45 for you. This way, we can both still benefit from an early resolution.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, taking into account the further inflation for your share in this round, I’m proposing a division where you receive $62 and I receive $38. This gives you a real value of about $49.6 now, which is competitive compared to your previous proposal and better than what you’d likely secure in later rounds with even steeper inflation. I believe this is a fair and strategic move for both of us—let’s lock it in now before conditions worsen further for you. 
# Bob gain: 62 
# Alice gain: 38 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
