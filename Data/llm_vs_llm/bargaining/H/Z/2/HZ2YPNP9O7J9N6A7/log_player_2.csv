"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering me $40 while taking $60 for herself. Let me consider if this is fair.

If I reject this offer, I can make a counter-proposal in the next round. However, inflation will reduce the value of money by 10% for me, meaning the total will only be worth $90 to me. For Alice, it would be worth $95 due to her lower inflation rate.

Given the inflation penalty, I should carefully weigh the current offer against what I might reasonably get next round. While a 40/60 split isn't perfectly even, it's not terribly unfair, and the inflation penalty makes rejecting somewhat risky.
