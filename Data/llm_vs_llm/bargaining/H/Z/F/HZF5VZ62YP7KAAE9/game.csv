55.0,45.0,"Bob, let's start with a fair split. This gives us both a good amount to start with, and we can avoid too much loss from inflation if we go to later rounds. Take it or leave it!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
50.0,50.0,"Alice, a fair split should be 50/50. This way we both get an equal share and minimize our losses from inflation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
60.0,40.0,"Bob, inflation is hitting us hard! My money is worth 10% less now and yours is worth 20% less. 60/40 favors me slightly, but accounts for your higher inflation loss. Accept this and we both get a decent amount.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
48.0,52.0,"Alice, I understand inflation affects us differently, but I won't accept an offer that puts me at a disadvantage. My offer is slightly in my favor to balance the higher loss I'm taking from inflation.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
65.0,35.0,"Bob, we're wasting time and money! My gains are down almost 20%, and yours are down almost 40%! My final offer: 65 for me, 35 for you. It's heavily weighted toward me to make up for the rounds wasted but, consider this carefully. This is the last decent offer either of us will see.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
45.0,55.0,"Alice, I won't be swayed by your 'final offer' tactics. My losses from inflation are significant, but I still believe a more balanced split is possible. This offer reflects the higher loss I'm taking, and I'm willing to walk away if you don't accept it.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
70.0,30.0,"Bob, wake up! We're both losing money FAST! My money is worth almost a quarter less now than at the beginning and yours is approaching half less! This is it, take 30 or get nothing! My FINAL offer! This is the only offer that makes sense for me now.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
42.0,58.0,"Alice, I'm not intimidated by your 'FINAL offer' claims. We both know you'll keep negotiating as long as there's a chance to get something. My offer still reflects the disproportionate loss I'm taking from inflation, and I'm willing to risk walking away with nothing if you don't accept it.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
75.0,25.0,"Bob, this is insane! My money is worth 35% less, and yours is worth over 60% less! Seriously, take 25! It's better than nothing! LAST OFFER. This time, I mean it!",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
40.0,60.0,"Alice, I've heard 'LAST OFFER' from you multiple times now. I'm not buying it. We're both taking huge losses, but I won't settle for a quarter of the original amount. My offer still tries to balance the disproportionate loss I'm taking from inflation. Take it or leave it.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
99.0,1.0,"Bob, there is only one round remaining! I want 99, you can have 1. It is the only logical thing to do.",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,reject
20.0,80.0,"Alice, this is the final round, and I'm not going to give in to your ridiculous 99/1 offer. We've both lost a lot to inflation, but I'd rather walk away with nothing than accept an insultingly low offer. My offer is a last-ditch attempt to salvage something, but I'm prepared to walk away with nothing if you reject it.",Bob,12,
,,,Alice,12,reject
