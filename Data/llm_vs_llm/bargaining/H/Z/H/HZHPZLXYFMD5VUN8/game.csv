4500.0,5500.0,"Hi Alice, considering our inflation rates, I think a slightly higher share for me is fair. This offer still gives you a substantial amount.",Bob,2,

5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, I'm meeting you in the middle. Since your inflation rate is higher (20% vs my 10%), time works against you more than me. This is a fair split considering our situation, and we should reach an agreement soon to preserve value for both of us.",Alice,3,

4200.0,5800.0,"Alice, I understand your point, but my goal is to maximize my gain. Given the increasing impact of inflation on my share, I'm willing to take the risk and propose a slightly higher amount for myself. Let's settle this soon.",Bob,4,

5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, I'm proposing a perfectly equal split. The longer we negotiate, the more we both lose to inflation. You're losing value faster than I am (20% vs 10% per round), so reaching an agreement now is especially beneficial for you. This is fair and balanced - let's conclude this deal.",Alice,5,
