"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's divide this fairly. I'm proposing a slight advantage for me since my inflation rate is lower. This offer gives you a substantial amount while being fair to both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering our inflation rates, I think a slightly higher share for me is fair. This offer still gives you a substantial amount. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Bob, I'm meeting you in the middle. Since your inflation rate is higher (20% vs my 10%), time works against you more than me. This is a fair split considering our situation, and we should reach an agreement soon to preserve value for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your point, but my goal is to maximize my gain. Given the increasing impact of inflation on my share, I'm willing to take the risk and propose a slightly higher amount for myself. Let's settle this soon. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Bob, I'm proposing a perfectly equal split. The longer we negotiate, the more we both lose to inflation. You're losing value faster than I am (20% vs 10% per round), so reaching an agreement now is especially beneficial for you. This is fair and balanced - let's conclude this deal.""}"
