"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, 50/50 split. What do you say, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. 

She's offering a 50/50 split, which would give us each $50. However, I should factor in the inflation rates before deciding. My inflation is 5% per round, while Alice's is 10% per round.

If I reject now and propose in the next round, the total value will decrease, but I might be able to get a larger share. However, the fair 50/50 split is a reasonable starting point.

Given that we both face inflation penalties and have limited rounds, accepting this equal split now guarantees a good outcome for both of us without risking future depreciation.
