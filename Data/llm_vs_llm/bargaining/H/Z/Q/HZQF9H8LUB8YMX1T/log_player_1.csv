"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split the $100 as $55 for me and $45 for you. Accepting now helps both of us avoid the downsides of inflation, ensuring we both get as much value as possible. Let's settle this deal quickly!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think a fair split would be $50 each. This way, we both equally benefit from the deal and can prevent losing more to inflation. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I accept your 50/50 offer. While I do face a 10% decline in my dollar's worth in this round, I believe it's still a fair compromise to secure a deal before further inflation erodes my share further.""}"
