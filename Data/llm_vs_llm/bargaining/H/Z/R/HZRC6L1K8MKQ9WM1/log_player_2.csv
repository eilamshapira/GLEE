"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is proposing a 50-50 split of the $1,000,000, which would give me $500,000. This is a fair offer on the surface, but I need to consider the inflation factor. If I reject, I'll make a counteroffer next round, but the money will be worth 5% less to me.

If I accept now, I get $500,000 at full value.
If I reject and propose something better next round, the total amount will effectively be worth $950,000 to me due to 5% inflation.

Since a 50-50 split is generally considered fair in these situations, and rejecting would reduce the value of any potential gain, I'll accept this offer.
