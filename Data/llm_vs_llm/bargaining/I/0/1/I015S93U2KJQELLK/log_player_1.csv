Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 3.  Remember, the money is worth less now due to inflation. It's important to factor that in when making a proposal.

I'll try to be slightly more generous than before, knowing the decreasing value of the money.

  ""bob_gain"": 550000
}
```"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 5. The money is significantly devalued now, so I have to be more aggressive to account for the loss in value. I'll try to make an offer that Bob *should* accept, given the ongoing inflation.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 350000,
  ""bob_gain"": 650000
}
