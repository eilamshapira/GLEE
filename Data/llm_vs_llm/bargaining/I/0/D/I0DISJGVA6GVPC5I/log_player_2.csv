"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a fair split where I get slightly more as the first mover. Let's avoid lengthy negotiations that will reduce the money's value for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me 450,000$ out of 1,000,000$
2. If I reject, we'll move to the next round where I can make an offer
3. However, due to 5% inflation, the money will be worth less for me in the next round
4. 450,000$ now is better than potentially getting 500,000$ next round which would be worth 475,000$ to me
5. Further negotiations could lead to even more value loss
6. The split is reasonably fair, and Alice's argument about avoiding lengthy negotiations is valid

Given these considerations, I'll accept this offer.
