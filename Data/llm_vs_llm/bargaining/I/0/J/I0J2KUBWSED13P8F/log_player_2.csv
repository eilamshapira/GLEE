Alice's offer is getting closer to a more reasonable split, but it's still not in my favor considering the impact of inflation on her gains.  I need to push for a larger share before the value diminishes further for her."

This is frustrating.  While Alice's offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, she's clearly trying to take advantage of the situation. I need to hold firm and hope she understands the situation before it's too late."
