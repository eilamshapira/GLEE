6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I lose more value (20%) than you (5%) each round. This is fair and allows us both to walk away with a good amount.",Alice,1,

8000.0,2000.0,"Hi Alice, considering that waiting will cost you more (20% per round) and that you'll only get around $6400 in effective value as proposer next round, Iâ€™m offering you $8000 now. This way, you get the same discounted value immediately, while I retain $2000 (which is worth about $1900 to me). I trust you'll agree that finalizing now is in both our best interests. Looking forward to your acceptance.",Bob,2,
