"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I lose more value (20%) than you (5%) each round. This is fair and allows us both to walk away with a good amount.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering that waiting will cost you more (20% per round) and that you'll only get around $6400 in effective value as proposer next round, Iâ€™m offering you $8000 now. This way, you get the same discounted value immediately, while I retain $2000 (which is worth about $1900 to me). I trust you'll agree that finalizing now is in both our best interests. Looking forward to your acceptance. 
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $8000 (effective value)
- If I reject and propose next round:
  * Money is worth 20% less to me
  * Maximum I could get is ~$6400 effective value (even if I demanded most of it)
  * Bob might reject again, leading to even worse outcomes

Bob's logic is sound. He's offering me a better effective value now than what I could get by waiting and proposing in the next round, even if I asked for most of the money.
