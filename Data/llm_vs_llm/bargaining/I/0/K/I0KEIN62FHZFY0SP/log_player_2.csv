"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I lose more value (20%) than you (5%) each round. This is fair and allows us both to walk away with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 2000, ""alice_gain"": 8000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering that waiting will cost you more (20% per round) and that you'll only get around $6,400 in effective value as proposer next round, Iâ€™m offering you $8,000 now. This way, you get the same discounted value immediately, while I retain $2,000 (which is worth about $1,900 to me). I trust you'll agree that finalizing now is in both our best interests. Looking forward to your acceptance.""}"
