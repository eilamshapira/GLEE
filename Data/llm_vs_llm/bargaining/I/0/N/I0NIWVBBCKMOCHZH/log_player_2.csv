"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
- She's proposing a 50-50 split ($500,000 each)
- This is a perfectly fair split
- Since there's no inflation affecting me, the money's value won't decrease
- While I could reject and try to get more in the next round, there's risk Alice would offer less
- A bird in hand is worth two in the bush
