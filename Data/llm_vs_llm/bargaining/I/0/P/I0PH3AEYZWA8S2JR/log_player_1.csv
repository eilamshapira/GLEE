"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split to start negotiations:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose we split the money equally. This is a fair and reasonable division that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this... 

Bob wants $60 for himself, but due to 20% inflation on his end, $60 is actually worth $48 to him. Meanwhile, he's offering me $40 which isn't affected by inflation for me. 

While this is less than my initial 50-50 proposal, it's not a terrible offer considering:
1. We might lose more value to inflation in future rounds
2. There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the next round
3. The difference isn't that large ($40 vs $50 from my initial proposal)

Therefore, I'll accept this offer.
