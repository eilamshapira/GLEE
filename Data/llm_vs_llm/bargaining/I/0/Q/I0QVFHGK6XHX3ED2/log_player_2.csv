# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concern about inflation affecting you. I'm offering you more than half to account for that, which is fair considering we both want to resolve this efficiently. This way we both get a substantial amount without further devaluation.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I recognize that inflation is significantly affecting you - you've already lost over 27% of value. My offer gives you 60% of the total, which more than compensates for the current inflation impact. Further delays will only reduce the real value of your share. This is a fair solution for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000
