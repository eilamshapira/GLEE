5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, let's start with a fair offer. I propose 5500 for me and 4500 for you. This gives us both a substantial amount and leaves room for negotiation if needed, but I hope you find this agreeable. Let's secure a good outcome for both of us early on!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I think I deserve a bit more. Considering the inflation, I'd like to settle this quickly. Let's divide it 60-40, and we can both walk away with a good amount before the money loses more value.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6200.0,3800.0,"Bob, I understand you want more, but I think 60/40 is a bit steep considering we have a limited number of rounds. I propose we meet in the middle. I'll take 6200, leaving you with 3800. This reflects the time constraint and the diminishing value. Let's close the deal.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4200.0,5800.0,"Alice, I see you're willing to adjust, but I still think your offer is a bit one-sided. Considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money for me, I'm willing to compromise. Let's do 58-42, and I'll accept the deal. This is as low as I'm willing to go, given the time pressure and inflation.",Bob,4,
