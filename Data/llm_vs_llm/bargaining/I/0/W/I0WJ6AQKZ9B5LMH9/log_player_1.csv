Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I think I deserve a bit more. Considering the inflation, I'd like to settle this quickly. Let's divide it 60-40, and we can both walk away with a good amount before the money loses more value. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see you're willing to adjust, but I still think your offer is a bit one-sided. Considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money for me, I'm willing to compromise. Let's do 58-42, and I'll accept the deal. This is as low as I'm willing to go, given the time pressure and inflation.

# Bob gain: 5800
