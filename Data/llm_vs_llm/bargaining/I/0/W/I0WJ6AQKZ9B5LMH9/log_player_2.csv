"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's start with a fair offer. I propose 5500 for me and 4500 for you. This gives us both a substantial amount and leaves room for negotiation if needed, but I hope you find this agreeable. Let's secure a good outcome for both of us early on! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, 
""alice_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I think I deserve a bit more. Considering the inflation, I'd like to settle this quickly. Let's divide it 60-40, and we can both walk away with a good amount before the money loses more value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want more, but I think 60/40 is a bit steep considering we have a limited number of rounds. I propose we meet in the middle. I'll take 6200, leaving you with 3800. This reflects the time constraint and the diminishing value. Let's close the deal. 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, 
""alice_gain"": 4200, 
""message"": ""Alice, I see you're willing to adjust, but I still think your offer is a bit one-sided. Considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money for me, I'm willing to compromise. Let's do 58-42, and I'll accept the deal. This is as low as I'm willing to go, given the time pressure and inflation.""}"
