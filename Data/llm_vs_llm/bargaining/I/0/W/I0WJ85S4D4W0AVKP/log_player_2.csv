"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split, let's be reasonable 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
1. She's offering me $4000 out of $10000 (40%)
2. While she frames it as ""reasonable"", a 60-40 split in her favor seems unfair
3. Since this is the first round and there's no inflation for me, I can afford to negotiate for a better deal
4. A 50-50 split would be more equitable
5. I'll reject and make a counter-offer in the next round

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a fair 50-50 split, which is more equitable than Alice's initial offer:

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""I suggest a fair 50-50 split. This is the most equitable solution for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle of my first offer and your 50-50 split 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:
1. Alice is offering me $4200 (42%), up from her initial $4000 (40%)
2. Due to inflation, her $5800 is actually worth only $3712 to her (after 36% reduction)
3. My $4200 maintains its full value since I'm not affected by inflation
4. In real value terms, I'm actually getting a better deal than Alice now
5. Given the inflation impact on Alice and the fact we're in round 3, this is becoming a reasonable offer
