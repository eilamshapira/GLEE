"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a nearly even split that slightly favors me as I'm facing 10% inflation per round. This is fair since we both want to avoid lengthy negotiations that would reduce the total value for everyone. 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since this is the first round, the inflation effect on me (20% loss per round) hasn't kicked in yet. Considering Alice's offer, I get $490,000, which is close to half of the total amount.

Given that I don't know the exact inflation rate for Alice, but she mentioned it's 10%, and considering I have a higher inflation rate (20%), it might be beneficial for me to accept an offer early on to avoid losing more value in subsequent rounds.
