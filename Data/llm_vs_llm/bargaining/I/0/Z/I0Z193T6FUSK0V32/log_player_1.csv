"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my offer to divide the $1,000,000 with Bob. Since I'm playing as Alice, I need to consider that Bob faces a 20% inflation penalty per round, while I don't face any inflation.

Given this asymmetry, I should propose a fair offer that Bob would reasonably accept now rather than waiting for future rounds where his share would be worth less.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm suggesting a slightly higher amount for myself since Bob has an incentive to accept earlier due to the inflation penalty he faces in future rounds. This offer gives Bob a substantial portion while acknowledging the strategic advantage I have in the game structure."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more strategic offer considering that Bob rejected my first proposal and I rejected his counter-offer. Since we're now in round 3, Bob faces 40% cumulative inflation from the original value if we move to round 4.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm offering an equal split, which is fair and reasonable. Bob should consider accepting this because if we continue to round 4, his share will be worth significantly less due to the 20% inflation penalty he faces each round. This balanced offer respects both our interests and acknowledges the time pressure Bob faces."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 448000 
# Bob gain: 552000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I notice Bob is gradually increasing my share with each of his offers, which suggests he's feeling the pressure of inflation. Given that we're now in round 5, and Bob would face approximately 59% cumulative inflation by round 6, I'll adjust my offer to be more appealing while still maintaining a strategic advantage.

{""alice_gain"": 480000, 
""bob_gain"": 520000}

This offer gives Bob a slightly higher portion than my last offer while still securing a reasonable amount for myself. Since Bob's money loses 20% value each round, he should recognize that accepting now is better than continuing to negotiate when his share will be worth significantly less in future rounds."
