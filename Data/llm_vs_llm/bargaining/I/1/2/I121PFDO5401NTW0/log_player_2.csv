"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I think this is a reasonable split.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000 (40/60 split)
2. If I reject, we move to round 2 where:
   - I can make an offer
   - My money will be worth 5% less
   - Alice's money will be worth 20% less
3. Alice's higher inflation rate (20%) puts me in a stronger negotiating position in later rounds
4. $4,000 now is better than $4,000 later due to inflation

However, given Alice's high inflation rate and my ability to make the next offer, I believe I can get a better deal. A 50/50 split would be more fair, and Alice's high inflation rate will make her more likely to accept a better offer for me in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that Alice is facing 20% inflation per round compared to my 5%, I'll propose a more favorable split for me, but still reasonable enough that she might accept to avoid significant value loss.

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Given our different inflation rates, this split is actually favorable for both of us. If we continue negotiating, your share will lose value much faster than mine. This is a fair offer that protects both our interests.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable.  I'm willing to split it 50/50.  This way we both get a decent amount and we don't risk losing more money with inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is now offering a 50/50 split ($5,000 each)
2. Due to inflation:
   - My $5,000 is worth effectively $4,512.50 (9.75% less)
   - Alice's $5,000 is worth effectively $3,200 (36% less)
3. If I reject:
   - Next round my inflation will be around 15% total
   - Alice's inflation will be around 56% total
   - I can make another offer, but the total value keeps decreasing

This is actually a reasonable offer considering:
- It's a fair 50/50 split
- Further delays will significantly reduce value for both of us
- The next round will see substantial value loss, especially for Alice
- We still have 9 rounds left, but the value is declining rapidly
