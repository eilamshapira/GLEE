550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split where I get slightly more since I'm making the first offer and taking initiative. This is a good deal for both of us, considering the inflation risk.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Let's be fair and split it equally. This way, we both get a good deal and avoid the risk of inflation. ",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, considering I'm now facing 10% total inflation on my share, I need a larger portion to maintain fair value. This offer still gives you a substantial amount, and we should agree soon before inflation reduces the value further for both of us.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, my value is also decreasing. I suggest I get 550 thousand and you get 450 thousand. Let's settle this before we lose more value.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
575000.0,425000.0,"Bob, I'm compromising from my last offer. With nearly 20% inflation affecting me now, this split is actually quite fair. We're in round 5 and time is running out - let's make a deal now before we both lose more value.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
440000.0,560000.0,"Alice, I understand that inflation is affecting you, but it's also affecting me. I've increased your share from my last offer. Let's settle this soon, as we're both losing value over time.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I'm making a significant compromise from my previous offers. Given we're in round 7 with inflation over 25% for me, this split actually gives me much less real value than it appears. We only have 5 rounds left - if we don't agree soon, we both get nothing. Please accept this fair offer.",Alice,7,
