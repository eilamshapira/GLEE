"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split where I get slightly more since I'm making the first offer and taking initiative. This is a good deal for both of us, considering the inflation risk.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it equally. This way, we both get a good deal and avoid the risk of inflation.  
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Reasoning (not part of response): Since I'm facing 5% inflation, a 500k offer in round 2 is actually worth 475k to me. I should make a counter-offer in round 3, but I need to be strategic since the money will be worth even less in future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Bob, considering I'm now facing 10% total inflation on my share, I need a larger portion to maintain fair value. This offer still gives you a substantial amount, and we should agree soon before inflation reduces the value further for both of us.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, my value is also decreasing. I suggest I get 550 thousand and you get 450 thousand. Let's settle this before we lose more value. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Reasoning (not part of response): A 450k offer in round 4 with 14.26% inflation is only worth about 386k to me. This is significantly worse than previous offers. I'll make a counter-offer, but I need to be mindful that we're already in round 4 and the value keeps decreasing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 575000,
""bob_gain"": 425000,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm compromising from my last offer. With nearly 20% inflation affecting me now, this split is actually quite fair. We're in round 5 and time is running out - let's make a deal now before we both lose more value.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that inflation is affecting you, but it's also affecting me. I've increased your share from my last offer. Let's settle this soon, as we're both losing value over time. 
# Alice gain: 440000 
# Bob gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Reasoning (not part of response): With 22.62% inflation, a 440k offer is only worth about 340k to me. This is getting worse, but we still have 6 rounds left. I'll make another counter-offer, but I need to be more persuasive as we're running out of time."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm making a significant compromise from my previous offers. Given we're in round 7 with inflation over 25% for me, this split actually gives me much less real value than it appears. We only have 5 rounds left - if we don't agree soon, we both get nothing. Please accept this fair offer.""
