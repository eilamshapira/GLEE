Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth 20% less for me in each round, and 5% less for Bob. Since Bob's offer was 40 for me and 60 for him, and I rejected it, now it's my turn again.

To calculate the value, let's consider the original $100. After two rounds, the value for me would be 100 * 0.8 * 0.8 = $64, and for Bob, it would be 100 * 0.95 * 0.95 = $90.25.

However, the game still revolves around dividing the original $100, with the understanding that its value decreases over rounds differently for each player.

Given this, my strategy should aim to get the best possible share, considering the decreasing value.
