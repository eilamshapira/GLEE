"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is proposing I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 5% less to me
3. The 60-40 split in Alice's favor seems quite uneven, especially since I have no reason to believe she deserves more

I'll reject this offer. Even with the 5% inflation penalty, I can make a more favorable counter-offer next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split, but still give Alice a bit more to encourage acceptance:

{""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""I propose a more balanced 48-52 split that's fair for both of us. This is much more equitable than the previous 60-40 proposal.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle of our previous offers 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Alice is offering me $4,200, which due to 9.75% inflation is actually worth about $3,790 to me
2. She's taking $5,800, but it's worth much less to her due to 36% inflation
3. She's moving in the right direction from her first offer
4. If I reject, next round will have even more inflation for both of us
5. The fact that inflation affects her more heavily suggests I might have less leverage than I thought

Given that:
- The value loss from inflation is significant
- Alice is showing willingness to negotiate
- Further delays will reduce value for both of us
- Her inflation rate is much higher than mine

I'll accept this offer. The real value difference isn't as large as the nominal amounts suggest, and further negotiation might lead to worse outcomes for both of us.
