# Alice gain: 600000

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I'm proposing a slightly more even split. I understand that the value of the money decreases for me in each round, but I believe a more balanced agreement is better in the long run. Let's see what you think.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's a revised offer. With the decreasing value affecting you more each round, let's go with $550000 for me and $450000 for you. This way, we both get a good deal before the value drops further for you. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000
