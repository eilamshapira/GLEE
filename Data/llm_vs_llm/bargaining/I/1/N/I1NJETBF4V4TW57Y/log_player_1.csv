"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair initial offer, considering that I'm affected by 5% inflation each round.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing this division because it's fair while accounting for the fact that waiting will cost me due to inflation. I get 55% and you get 45% of the total amount, which is a reasonable split that respects both our interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
