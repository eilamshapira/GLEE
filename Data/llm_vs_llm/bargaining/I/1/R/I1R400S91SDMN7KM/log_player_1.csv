"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob, considering that each passing round reduces the value of money by 10% for me.

{""alice_gain"": 5500,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your perspective on the devaluation. Here's an even split proposal that seems fair given the circumstances. Let's keep it simple and ensure we both benefit equally. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
