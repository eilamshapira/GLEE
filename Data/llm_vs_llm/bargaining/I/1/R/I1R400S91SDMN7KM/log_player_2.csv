"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering a fair split that slightly favors me since I face a 10% devaluation penalty for each round. If we delay, we both lose value. This is a reasonable division that acknowledges the time pressure I face. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
