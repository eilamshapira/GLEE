"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer carefully given the game rules.

Alice has offered me 40$ out of the 100$, keeping 60$ for herself. 

Let me analyze this:
- There's no inflation for me, so 40$ now is worth 40$ in any future round
- For Alice, there's 20% inflation per round, meaning money is worth less to her in future rounds
- If I reject and make a counter-offer, Alice might reject it too, leading to round 3
- By round 3, 100$ will be worth only 64$ to Alice (80% of original value twice)

While I could try to negotiate for more, Alice's offer is reasonable considering she faces significant inflation penalties. I risk getting nothing if we don't reach agreement within 12 rounds.
