"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me propose a fair split, considering the 5% inflation penalty per round that affects my gains.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because it's reasonably favorable to both parties. I'm asking for slightly more because I have the disadvantage of the 5% inflation penalty per round, so there's more pressure on me to reach an agreement quickly. This is a fair starting point that gives Bob a substantial portion while accounting for my time pressure."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 470000 
# Bob gain: 530000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Bob is offering me $470,000, which due to 5% inflation is actually worth $446,500 to me
2. If I reject, I can make another offer, but any future gains will be worth even less due to inflation
3. This is a reasonable offer considering the inflation pressure, and getting a deal early is valuable
4. While I might try to negotiate for more, the risk of further rounds reducing my value isn't worth it
