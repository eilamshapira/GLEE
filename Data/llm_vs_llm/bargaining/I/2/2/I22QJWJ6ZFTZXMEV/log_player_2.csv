"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $450,000 (45%) while keeping $550,000 (55%)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. For Alice, money loses 5% value each round, while it maintains value for me
4. In the next round, $550,000 would only be worth $522,500 to Alice
5. This gives me negotiating leverage for a better deal

Given that time pressure affects Alice more than me, and this first offer isn't particularly favorable, I'll reject it to negotiate for a better split.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll make a strategic counter-offer:

1. Alice is losing 5% value per round, so she has incentive to agree soon
2. Her previous offer showed she wants a significant portion
3. I'll propose a more balanced split in my favor, but not too aggressive to avoid multiple rounds

I'll propose:

{""bob_gain"": 530000, ""alice_gain"": 470000}

This is a reasonable counter-offer because:
- It gives me a modest advantage (53%)
- It's not so unfair that Alice would definitely reject
- If Alice rejects, her potential gains will be worth less in the next round
- It's a small enough shift from her original offer to be potentially acceptable"
