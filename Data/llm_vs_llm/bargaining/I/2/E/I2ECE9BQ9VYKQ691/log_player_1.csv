"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair given the inflation risk I'm facing.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. Given that I rejected your offer and considering the potential inflation effects, I believe this is a fair counter-offer. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept, I get $45, but due to 5% inflation, it's actually worth $42.75 to me
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer, any amount I get will be worth another 5% less
3. Bob might reject again, leading to even more value loss for me
4. The current offer is not too far from a fair split
5. Further negotiation might lead to worse outcomes due to inflation
