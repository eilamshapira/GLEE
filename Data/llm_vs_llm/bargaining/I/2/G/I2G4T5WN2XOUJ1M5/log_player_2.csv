"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

The total amount is $1,000,000, and Alice is offering me $400,000 (40%) while keeping $600,000 (60%) for herself.

If I reject:
- The money will be worth 20% less for me in the next round
- For Alice, it will only be worth 5% less
- But I'll get to make the next proposal

With such a steep inflation penalty for me (20%), rejecting this offer means I would need to secure significantly more in the next round just to break even. 

$400,000 now vs. potentially (need at least $500,000 in next round to offset my 20% penalty)

While the split isn't entirely in my favor, given the asymmetric inflation penalties and the risk of further rounds, this is actually a reasonable offer.
