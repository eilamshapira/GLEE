"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I think this split is fair. Let's end this quickly before our money loses more value. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's split it evenly this time. Inflation is hurting us both, and a 50-50 split seems the fairest way to end this game quickly. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

While I would have preferred my 55/45 split, accepting a 50/50 split now is better than risking further inflation and potentially getting a worse offer in later rounds."
