"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the inflation. My money is now worth 20% less, and Bob's is worth 5% less.

If I accept, I get $5000, but it's worth only 80% of its original value.

So, I am effectively getting 5000 * 0.8 = $4000 worth of value.

I need to decide whether $4000 worth of value is better than taking the chance of getting less in future rounds (where I'll have even less).

Given the time pressure (12 rounds), and the risk of getting nothing, I will **reject** and try to negotiate better in the next round.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 3. Remember, my money is worth 20% less than in Round 1.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
