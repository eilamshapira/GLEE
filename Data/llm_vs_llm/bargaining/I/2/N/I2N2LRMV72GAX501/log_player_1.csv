"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a reasonable first offer that gives both of us a good share while being fair enough that Bob might accept it.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split where I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000. This is a fair offer that gives me a slight advantage as the first mover, but still provides Bob with a substantial amount. If Bob rejects this, we'll both lose 20% of the total value in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept, I get $450,000 (but worth 20% less due to inflation, so effectively $360,000)
2. If I reject, we go to round 3 with another 20% loss, and the total pie shrinks to $640,000
3. Bob's counter-offer essentially reversed my initial proposal
4. Getting $360,000 now is better than risking further depreciation

Given these factors, I'll accept the offer. While not ideal, it's still a significant amount, and the risk of further value loss makes this a reasonable deal.
