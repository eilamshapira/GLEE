"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40 in my favor. It's a fair start considering the inflation affects you more. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. With 40% of $1,000,000, I would get $400,000, while Alice would get $600,000. If I reject and we go to the next round, the total money will be worth 20% less to me, meaning the $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $800,000 to me.

If I reject and make a counter-offer, I need to propose something better than $400,000 for me, considering that in the next round, the maximum I could get would be $800,000. However, Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation for me.

Given these considerations, Alice's initial offer actually gives me a reasonable share considering the inflation penalty I face. If we go another round, I'd need to secure more than 50% to beat this current offer.
