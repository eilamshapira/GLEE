"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to consider the inflation effect on my potential gains as rounds progress.

Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

My reasoning: I'm asking for a slightly larger share initially because I need to factor in the potential loss due to inflation if we go to further rounds. A 60/40 split gives me a good starting point while still leaving Bob with a substantial amount that he might find acceptable."
