1.0,999999.0,"Alice, every additional round reduces the value of your share by 20%, while mine remain unchanged. If you reject now, you'll be in a position to propose in round 3—but then you’ll be forced to make concessions to induce my acceptance, leaving you with almost nothing. Accept this offer now to secure at least a minimal benefit rather than facing further devaluation.",Bob,2,

300000.0,700000.0,"Considering inflation, this is a reasonable split. Accepting now avoids further risk for both of us.",Alice,3,

1.0,999999.0,"Alice, with each passing round your dollar loses another 20% of its original value – now at only 51.2% of its initial worth. If you reject, you'll soon find yourself with almost no bargaining power, as in the next round you'll be forced to concede nearly everything to keep Bob happy. Take this minimal yet positive offer rather than risking further devaluation. Accepting ensures you get something rather than nothing.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
200000.0,800000.0,This is my final reasonable offer. Further rejection will lead to me having virtually no value to negotiate with. Accepting now gives you a significant majority while still allowing me to walk away with something.,Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
800000.0,200000.0,"Alice, consider the impact of inflation: if you reject this offer, you'll be the proposer in round 7—but due to further devaluation, every dollar you gain then will be worth only 0.262144 of its face value. In contrast, by accepting now, your 800000 dollars will retain a value of 800000 × 0.32768 ≈ 262144 in first‐round terms, which exactly matches what you could ensure for yourself later. I'm offering you precisely your continuation value. Accepting now avoids additional risk and further discounting of your share.",Bob,6,
