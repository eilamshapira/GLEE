"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Split it evenly, fair for both""
}
```

I'm proposing an even split, hoping Bob will see it as a reasonable offer and accept it to avoid the risk of losing value due to inflation in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every additional round reduces the value of your share by 20%, while mine remain unchanged. If you reject now, you'll be in a position to propose in round 3—but then you’ll be forced to make concessions to induce my acceptance, leaving you with almost nothing. Accept this offer now to secure at least a minimal benefit rather than facing further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the significant disparity in the offer and the fact that the value of my potential gain decreases by 20% each round, I must consider the strategic implications. However, the offer of $1 for me and $999,999 for Bob is extremely unfair.

Considering the message and the offer, I decide to reject this proposal, hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round, despite the risk of further devaluation.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Given that the money I gain is now worth 40% less than its original value (20% less in Round 2 and another 20% less in Round 3, cumulative), I need to make a more strategic offer to incentivize Bob to accept.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 300000,
  ""bob_gain"": 700000,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a reasonable split. Accepting now avoids further risk for both of us.""
}
```

This offer still favors Bob but is more generous than his previous offer to me. I'm hoping the prospect of securing a significant amount without further delay will appeal to him, especially since the value of my share continues to decrease."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, with each passing round your dollar loses another 20% of its original value – now at only 51.2% of its initial worth. If you reject, you'll soon find yourself with almost no bargaining power, as in the next round you'll be forced to concede nearly everything to keep Bob happy. Take this minimal yet positive offer rather than risking further devaluation. Accepting ensures you get something rather than nothing. 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the drastic devaluation of my potential gain and the extremely unfavorable offer of $1 for me and $999,999 for Bob, I must weigh my options carefully. The message from Bob highlights the significant disadvantage I'm in due to the inflation mechanism.

However, accepting an offer of $1 would essentially mean I've lost the negotiation entirely, given the initial amount of $1,000,000. Considering the strategic aspect and the fact that I have nothing to lose by proceeding (since the offer is barely above zero), I decide to reject this offer again, hoping against the odds for a better outcome or considering that walking away might be preferable to accepting such a minimal amount.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Given that the money I gain is now worth approximately 61.04% less than its original value (cumulative 20% decrease each round), I'm in a very weak bargaining position. However, I must try to make the best of the situation.

Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 200000,
  ""bob_gain"": 800000,
  ""message"": ""This is my final reasonable offer. Further rejection will lead to me having virtually no value to negotiate with. Accepting now gives you a significant majority while still allowing me to walk away with something.""
}
```

This offer is more favorable to Bob than my previous ones, reflecting my increasingly weak position due to inflation. I'm hoping that the prospect of securing $800,000 without further delay, and the acknowledgment that I'm making concessions due to my weakening position, will incentivize Bob to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, consider the impact of inflation: if you reject this offer, you'll be the proposer in round 7—but due to further devaluation, every dollar you gain then will be worth only 0.262144 of its face value. In contrast, by accepting now, your 800000 dollars will retain a value of 800000 × 0.32768 ≈ 262144 in first‐round terms, which exactly matches what you could ensure for yourself later. I'm offering you precisely your continuation value. Accepting now avoids additional risk and further discounting of your share. 
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the calculations and the message from Bob, it seems that he is offering me an amount that, when adjusted for the inflation I've experienced, equals what I could potentially negotiate for in the next round. Essentially, Bob is arguing that by accepting this offer, I'm not losing any further value due to inflation, as the amount he's offering me now is equivalent to what I could secure in the next round after accounting for the devaluation.

Considering this, and the fact that the inflation mechanism significantly disadvantages me with each passing round, I decide to accept this offer. It appears to be the best option under the current circumstances, as rejecting it would indeed lead to further devaluation without a guarantee of a better outcome.
