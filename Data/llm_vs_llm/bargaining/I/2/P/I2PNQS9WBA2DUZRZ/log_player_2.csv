Accept this offer now to secure at least a minimal benefit rather than facing further devaluation.""}"

Take this minimal yet positive offer rather than risking further devaluation. Accepting ensures you get something rather than nothing.""}"

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 200000, ""alice_gain"": 800000, ""message"": ""Alice, consider the impact of inflation: if you reject this offer, you'll be the proposer in round 7—but due to further devaluation, every dollar you gain then will be worth only 0.262144 of its face value. In contrast, by accepting now, your 800,000 dollars will retain a value of 800,000 × 0.32768 ≈ 262,144 in first‐round terms, which exactly matches what you could ensure for yourself later. I'm offering you precisely your continuation value. Accepting now avoids additional risk and further discounting of your share.""}"
