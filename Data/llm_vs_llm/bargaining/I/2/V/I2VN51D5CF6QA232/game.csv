600000.0,400000.0,Let's split it 60-40 in my favor to account for the higher inflation rate I'm facing.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I know the waiting game hurts you more due to the steeper devaluation rate. If we delay further, you'll lose 20% of value on your share each round, while I lose only 10%. To avoid unnecessary loss, I propose a division where you get $450000 and I get $550000. I believe this is a fair solution given our circumstances; please accept this offer in round 2.",Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"I understand your point, Bob, but I think a 55-45 split in my favor is more fair considering the inflation rates. Let's settle this before the money loses more value for both of us.",Alice,3,
