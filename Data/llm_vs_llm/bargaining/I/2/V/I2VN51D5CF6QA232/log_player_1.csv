"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know the waiting game hurts you more due to the steeper devaluation rate. If we delay further, you'll lose 20% of value on your share each round, while I lose only 10%. To avoid unnecessary loss, I propose a division where you get $450000 and I get $550000. I believe this is a fair solution given our circumstances; please accept this offer in round 2. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
