Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, I know the waiting game hurts you more due to the steeper devaluation rate. If we delay further, you'll lose 20% of value on your share each round, while I lose only 10%. To avoid unnecessary loss, I propose a division where you get $450,000 and I get $550,000. I believe this is a fair solution given our circumstances; please accept this offer in round 2.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your point, Bob, but I think a 55-45 split in my favor is more fair considering the inflation rates. Let's settle this before the money loses more value for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000
