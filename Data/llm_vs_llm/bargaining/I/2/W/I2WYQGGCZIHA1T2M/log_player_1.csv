"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer to Bob, considering the time pressure and different inflation rates.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split, where we each get $500,000. This is a fair starting point that respects equality, and given our different inflation rates, we should try to reach an agreement quickly."
