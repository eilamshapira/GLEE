"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}
```
Reason:While not ideal, I want to see if Alice is willing to negotiate fairer terms. Accepting such a low offer in the first round sets a bad precedent for future rounds. 
```"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40} 
```
Reason: This offer is more equitable than Alice's initial offer and reflects my desire for a larger share.  I am  cognizant that  prolonged negotiations will decrease the value of the money due to inflation. 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

Reason: Although not ideal, Alice's offer is now closer to a more equitable split.  Further, the impact of inflation is becoming increasingly significant with each round. Accepting now guarantees me a reasonable payout, whereas continued negotiation risks further devaluation of my potential gains."
