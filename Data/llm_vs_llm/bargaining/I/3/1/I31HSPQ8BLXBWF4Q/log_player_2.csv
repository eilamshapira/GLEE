"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Since Alice's money loses 10% value each round and mine doesn't, I can use this to my advantage. If I reject now:

1. Next round I can make an offer
2. Alice's $5000 would only be worth $4500 to her in the next round
3. This gives me negotiating leverage to get a better deal

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice's money is now worth 10% less to her, I can leverage this to get a better deal. I'll propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which is better than 50-50 but not so extreme that she's likely to reject it.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

This offer gives me $6000 and Alice $4000. For Alice, her $4000 is actually worth $3600 due to the 10% devaluation. If she rejects this, her money will be worth even less next round, so she has an incentive to accept now."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice is offering me $5500, which is better than her initial offer
2. If I reject:
   - Next round, Alice's money will be worth 29% less to her
   - I could try for an even better deal
   - But there's risk Alice might then make a worse offer

However, $5500 is a decent offer, and continuing to negotiate might lead to a less favorable outcome if Alice becomes more aggressive in her counter-offers. The current offer gives me more than half, which is already leveraging the inflation situation in my favor.
