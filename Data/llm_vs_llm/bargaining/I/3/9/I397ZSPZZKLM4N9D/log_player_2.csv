"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $4000 for me
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, my next round money will be worth less
4. $4000 now vs. potential higher amount but worth 5% less next round
5. If I reject, $4000 would become worth $3800 in the next round

While I could try to negotiate for more, the 5% inflation penalty makes this current offer relatively reasonable. Getting $4000 now is better than risking a prolonged negotiation where my purchasing power decreases.
