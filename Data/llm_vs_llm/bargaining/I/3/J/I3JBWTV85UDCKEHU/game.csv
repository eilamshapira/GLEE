7000.0,3000.0,"Hey Bob, I propose that I take $7000 and you take $3000. Let's wrap this up quickly before we lose more to inflation!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
3103.0,6897.0,"Alice, considering that waiting costs us both—my money losing 5% per round and yours 10%—I propose a division that mirrors our respective time‐preferences. In this offer I take $6897 and you get $3103. This split is in line with the classic Rubinstein bargaining outcome given our discount factors, so by accepting now neither of us loses more value than necessary. I believe this is a fair and efficient resolution. What do you say?",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6500.0,3500.0,"Bob, I understand our values change with time, but I think a split of $6500 for me and $3500 for you reflects a fair compromise, given the inflation impact on us both so far. Let's reach an agreement this round!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
3100.0,6900.0,"Alice, to avoid further value loss due to inflation, I'm proposing a deal that mirrors our respective discount factors. If you reject, you’ll be in a position to propose next round but with a 10% further drop in value. Accepting now means you secure $3100 nominally—which, at the current 27.1% discount rate (0.729 factor), equals roughly what you’d expect in the future. I believe this split is fair given our time preferences. Let's end this on a positive note.",Bob,4,
