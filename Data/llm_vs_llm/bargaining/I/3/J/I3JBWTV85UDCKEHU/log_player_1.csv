"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Hey Bob, I propose that I take $7,000 and you take $3,000. Let's wrap this up quickly before we lose more to inflation!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering that waiting costs us both—my money losing 5% per round and yours 10%—I propose a division that mirrors our respective time‐preferences. In this offer I take $6897 and you get $3103. This split is in line with the classic Rubinstein bargaining outcome given our discount factors, so by accepting now neither of us loses more value than necessary. I believe this is a fair and efficient resolution. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 3103 
# Bob gain: 6897 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Bob, I understand our values change with time, but I think a split of $6,500 for me and $3,500 for you reflects a fair compromise, given the inflation impact on us both so far. Let's reach an agreement this round!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, to avoid further value loss due to inflation, I'm proposing a deal that mirrors our respective discount factors. If you reject, you’ll be in a position to propose next round but with a 10% further drop in value. Accepting now means you secure $3100 nominally—which, at the current 27.1% discount rate (0.729 factor), equals roughly what you’d expect in the future. I believe this split is fair given our time preferences. Let's end this on a positive note. 
# Alice gain: 3100 
# Bob gain: 6900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
