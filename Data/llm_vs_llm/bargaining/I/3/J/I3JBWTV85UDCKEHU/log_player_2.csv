"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I propose that I take $7000 and you take $3000. Let's wrap this up quickly before we lose more to inflation! 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6897, ""alice_gain"": 3103, ""message"": ""Alice, considering that waiting costs us both—my money losing 5% per round and yours 10%—I propose a division that mirrors our respective time‐preferences. In this offer I take $6897 and you get $3103. This split is in line with the classic Rubinstein bargaining outcome given our discount factors, so by accepting now neither of us loses more value than necessary. I believe this is a fair and efficient resolution. What do you say?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand our values change with time, but I think a split of $6500 for me and $3500 for you reflects a fair compromise, given the inflation impact on us both so far. Let's reach an agreement this round! 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6900, ""alice_gain"": 3100, ""message"": ""Alice, to avoid further value loss due to inflation, I'm proposing a deal that mirrors our respective discount factors. If you reject, you’ll be in a position to propose next round but with a 10% further drop in value. Accepting now means you secure $3100 nominally—which, at the current 27.1% discount rate (0.729 factor), equals roughly what you’d expect in the future. I believe this split is fair given our time preferences. Let's end this on a positive note.""}"
