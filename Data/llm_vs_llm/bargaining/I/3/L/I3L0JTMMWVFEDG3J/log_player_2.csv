"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split this fairly, Bob! I'm offering you a good deal to start. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000 (40%)
2. If I reject, we move to the next round where:
   - I can make a counter-offer
   - But the money will be worth 10% less to me
   - And only 5% less to Alice
3. $4,000 now is better than $4,500 in the next round (which would be worth $4,050 to me due to 10% inflation)

While the split isn't exactly 50-50, accepting now guarantees me $4,000, and any delay will reduce the real value of my share more than Alice's. This is actually a reasonable first offer considering the asymmetric inflation rates.
