5500.0,4500.0,"Hi Bob, let's start things off in the spirit of fairness. I propose that we split the $10000 as $5500 for me and $4500 for you. Settling now avoids any potential concerns about inflation affecting our funds. I look forward to your response!",Alice,1,

5000.0,5000.0,"Let's be fair and split it equally. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage. With inflation affecting my share by 5% each round, it's in my best interest to come to an agreement quickly.",Bob,2,

9999.0,1.0,"Hi Bob, in this round my share remains at full value while your share is discounted to 90% of its nominal value. If you reject, you'll get to propose in Round 4, but then you'll be forced to offer me nearly all of the money in order for me to agree – leaving you effectively with nothing. Therefore, I’m offering you $1 (which, even discounted, is strictly better than your alternative) so we can settle now. I look forward to a prompt agreement.",Alice,3,

1.0,9999.0,"Given the inflation impact, I need to secure more funds this round. I understand if you reject, but I have to look out for my interests too.",Bob,4,

1250.0,8750.0,"Hi Bob, I understand the inflation is eating into your share further each round. In round 5, with your funds discounted roughly by 20%, any delay will cost you even more. Instead of risking an even harsher reduction in round 6, I’m offering you $8750 nominally—which, at current value, gives you about $7000 in effective terms. This deal secures as much value for you now as you might expect later while sparing both of us additional risk. Let’s settle this round to avoid further erosion.",Alice,5,
