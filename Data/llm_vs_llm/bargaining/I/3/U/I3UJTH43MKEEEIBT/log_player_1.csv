Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's start things off in the spirit of fairness. I propose that we split the $10,000 as $5,500 for me and $4,500 for you. Settling now avoids any potential concerns about inflation affecting our funds. I look forward to your response!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it equally. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage. With inflation affecting my share by 5% each round, it's in my best interest to come to an agreement quickly. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 9999, ""bob_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, in this round my share remains at full value while your share is discounted to 90% of its nominal value. If you reject, you'll get to propose in Round 4, but then you'll be forced to offer me nearly all of the money in order for me to agree – leaving you effectively with nothing. Therefore, I’m offering you $1 (which, even discounted, is strictly better than your alternative) so we can settle now. I look forward to a prompt agreement.""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the inflation impact, I need to secure more funds this round. I understand if you reject, but I have to look out for my interests too. 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 9999

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 1250, ""bob_gain"": 8750, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand the inflation is eating into your share further each round. In round 5, with your funds discounted roughly by 20%, any delay will cost you even more. Instead of risking an even harsher reduction in round 6, I’m offering you $8,750 nominally—which, at current value, gives you about $7,000 in effective terms. This deal secures as much value for you now as you might expect later while sparing both of us additional risk. Let’s settle this round to avoid further erosion.""}"
