"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's split this fairly. I propose I get $55 and you get $45. Given inflation impacts you more, this seems like a good starting point.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want a larger share, but inflation is hitting me hard.  This split accounts for that. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
