"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game and the inflation rules. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

My reasoning is that Alice (me) makes the initial offer, so I am aiming for a slightly larger share, but still offering Bob a substantial amount to encourage acceptance. I hope Bob will accept this offer, as the money's value will decrease significantly for both of us in the next rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob's offer is 50/50.

Here's my calculation, considering the inflation:

*   **Alice's value of $50 now:** $50 * (1 - 0.05) = $47.50 in Round 1 dollars.

I will accept the offer.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
