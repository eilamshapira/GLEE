700000.0,300000.0,Let's split this fairly! I think this is a good starting point to make sure we both walk away happy.,Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I value reaching a swift and fair agreement. With each round our money loses value—and none of us wants that—I propose a near-equitable split: you receive $450000 and I keep $550000. I believe this deal reflects our mutual interests and avoids further devaluation. Let's secure our gains now!",Bob,2,

650000.0,350000.0,"Okay, Bob. I understand the urgency. How about this offer, I think this is a fair solution. Let's close the deal and take our money.",Alice,3,

640000.0,360000.0,"Alice, every extra round chips away at what we can both effectively receive—I'm losing value quickly. I know you’re aiming high, and while you previously proposed keeping $650000 for yourself, I'm offering you $640000 right now to settle immediately so you avoid any future uncertainty. This deal secures a prompt agreement before further devaluation hits us. Let’s close this round and keep our gains as high as possible!",Bob,4,
