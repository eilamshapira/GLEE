Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I value reaching a swift and fair agreement. With each round our money loses value—and none of us wants that—I propose a near-equitable split: you receive $450000 and I keep $550000. I believe this deal reflects our mutual interests and avoids further devaluation. Let's secure our gains now! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every extra round chips away at what we can both effectively receive—I'm losing value quickly. I know you’re aiming high, and while you previously proposed keeping $650000 for yourself, I'm offering you $640000 right now to settle immediately so you avoid any future uncertainty. This deal secures a prompt agreement before further devaluation hits us. Let’s close this round and keep our gains as high as possible! 
# Alice gain: 640000 
# Bob gain: 360000
