With each round our money loses value—and none of us wants that—I propose a near-equitable split: you receive $450,000 and I keep $550,000. I believe this deal reflects our mutual interests and avoids further devaluation. Let's secure our gains now!""}"

I know you’re aiming high, and while you previously proposed keeping $650,000 for yourself, I'm offering you $640,000 right now to settle immediately so you avoid any future uncertainty. This deal secures a prompt agreement before further devaluation hits us. Let’s close this round and keep our gains as high as possible!""}"
