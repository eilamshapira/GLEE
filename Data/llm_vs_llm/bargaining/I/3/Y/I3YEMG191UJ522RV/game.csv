45.0,55.0,"Alice, I value a swift agreement since delaying affects my share. I’m proposing I receive 55 and you receive 45. I believe this accounts for both our interests. Let’s settle quickly and avoid any further loss in value. What do you say?",Bob,2,

90.0,10.0,"Alice, every extra round increases uncertainty—and your dollars are already hit by inflation. While you might think that waiting will let you claim a larger nominal share, the risk is that further delays could worsen the devaluation on your side. To avoid that, I’m offering you $90 (which, even with inflation, should be worth considerably more than if we drag this out) while I take $10. I believe this protects both of us from further losses. What do you say?",Bob,4,
