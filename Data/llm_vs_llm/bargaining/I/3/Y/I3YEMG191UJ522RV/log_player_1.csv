Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I value a swift agreement since delaying affects my share. I’m proposing I receive 55 and you receive 45. I believe this accounts for both our interests. Let’s settle quickly and avoid any further loss in value. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every extra round increases uncertainty—and your dollars are already hit by inflation. While you might think that waiting will let you claim a larger nominal share, the risk is that further delays could worsen the devaluation on your side. To avoid that, I’m offering you $90 (which, even with inflation, should be worth considerably more than if we drag this out) while I take $10. I believe this protects both of us from further losses. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 90 
# Bob gain: 10 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
