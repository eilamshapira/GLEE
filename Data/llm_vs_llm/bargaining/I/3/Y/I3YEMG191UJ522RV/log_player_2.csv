"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly! I'll take 60, you take 40. What do you say, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, I value a swift agreement since delaying affects my share. I’m proposing I receive 55 and you receive 45. I believe this accounts for both our interests. Let’s settle quickly and avoid any further loss in value. What do you say?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob. Let's try this again. I'll take 55, and you take 45. This is a good deal for both of us, considering the time. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 10, ""alice_gain"": 90, ""message"": ""Alice, every extra round increases uncertainty—and your dollars are already hit by inflation. While you might think that waiting will let you claim a larger nominal share, the risk is that further delays could worsen the devaluation on your side. To avoid that, I’m offering you $90 (which, even with inflation, should be worth considerably more than if we drag this out) while I take $10. I believe this protects both of us from further losses. What do you say?""}"
