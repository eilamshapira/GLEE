"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, Bob. This offer gives you a solid start! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Current offer: I get $40, Alice gets $60
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
   * The money will be worth 10% less for me
   * The money will be worth 20% less for Alice
   * I could potentially get a better deal, but the total value will be less

While the split isn't exactly 50-50, rejecting would mean dealing with depreciated value. Since Alice already gets less value in future rounds due to her higher depreciation rate (20% vs my 10%), she might be less likely to accept a counter-offer.
