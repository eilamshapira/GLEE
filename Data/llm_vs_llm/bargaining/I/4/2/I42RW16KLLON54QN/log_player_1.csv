"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you starting the negotiation, but I believe an equal 50-50 split would be the fairest outcome for both of us. This way we both benefit equally and can conclude our negotiation with a balanced result. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer of a 50-50 split. This is a fair and reasonable division that benefits both parties equally, and it's better to secure this balanced outcome now rather than risk further negotiations that might lead to less favorable results or potentially nothing if we reach the round limit."
