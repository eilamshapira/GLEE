"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering I'm making the first move and taking the initiative. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's first offer carefully.

Alice is proposing that I get $40 while she gets $60. She justifies this by claiming that making the first move deserves a premium. While I understand her position, I should evaluate whether this split is optimal for me.

If I reject, I'll get to make a counter-proposal in the next round. There are still many rounds remaining, so I have time to negotiate. However, rejecting reasonable offers carries risk as we both get nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds.

A 60-40 split isn't terrible, but I believe a more equal division would be fairer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counter-offer that moves toward a more balanced split while showing willingness to compromise.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you starting the negotiation, but I believe an equal 50-50 split would be the fairest outcome for both of us. This way we both benefit equally and can conclude our negotiation with a balanced result. What do you think?""}"
