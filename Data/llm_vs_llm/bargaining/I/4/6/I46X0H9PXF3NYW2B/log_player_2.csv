"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start by dividing the money fairly. I propose you take $4000 and I take $6000. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice's proposal would give me $4000, it's not an equal split. Since this is the first round and there's no inflation yet, I think I can counter with a more balanced offer in the next round. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a fair split of the money, which is still worth the full $10,000 in this round.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I think a 50-50 split would be the fairest approach for both of us. We both walk away with $5000. This way neither of us feels disadvantaged.""}"
