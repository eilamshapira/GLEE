"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a division that takes into account the asymmetric time preferences in our situation. Since Bob's money loses 20% value each round while mine doesn't depreciate, a fair solution should acknowledge this difference.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose I get $60 and you get $40, Bob. This is fair considering your stronger incentive to conclude quickly due to the 20% depreciation you face each round. If we delay, your share becomes less valuable to you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
