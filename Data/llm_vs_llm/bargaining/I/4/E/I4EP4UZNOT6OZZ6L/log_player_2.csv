"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's settle this now. Considering that waiting costs you 20% per round and me 10%, this offer gives you the same effective value as you’d expect if we delayed further. I get $6147.76 and you get $3852.24. I believe this is a fair, efficient split—let’s conclude the game now and avoid further depreciation. 
# Bob gain: 3852.24 
# Alice gain: 6147.76 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
