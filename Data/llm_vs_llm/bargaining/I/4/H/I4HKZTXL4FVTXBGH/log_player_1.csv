"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a split that takes into account the different inflation rates affecting both players. Since Bob's money devalues faster (20% per round) compared to mine (10% per round), he has more incentive to accept a reasonable offer early.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this 60-40 split because:
1. It's a substantial amount for both parties
2. If Bob rejects, his next-round money will be worth 20% less, while mine only 10% less
3. It's fair enough to have a good chance of being accepted, avoiding the mutual loss from inflation"
