"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. 

Alice is offering me $400,000 while taking $600,000 for herself. If I reject and we move to round 2, the money will be worth 20% less to me, meaning the total pot will effectively be worth $800,000 to me. 

If I make a counter-offer in round 2, I could propose a better split for myself. However, Alice would then face a 10% reduction in value if she rejects (so the pot would be worth $900,000 to her in round 3).

Since the devaluation rate is higher for me than for Alice, delaying is more costly for me, which puts me at a disadvantage in negotiations.
