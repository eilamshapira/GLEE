"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a balanced first offer to establish a cooperative tone, while accounting for potential future inflation if Bob rejects.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}

I propose a slightly higher share for myself but still quite fair, as I need to account for the 5% inflation penalty I'll face if we need additional rounds. This offer gives Bob a substantial portion while protecting my interests against inflation risk."
