This is a tough decision. While the offer is getting closer to something more reasonable, the impact of inflation is starting to become significant. I'm hoping Alice will feel the pressure and offer a larger share in the next round."

The shrinking pot of money due to inflation is a real concern now, but I'm still hoping to secure a better deal than this.  Alice's offer is getting closer to an even split, which might be the best I can hope for given the circumstances."

It's frustrating to settle for an even split after all this time, especially with inflation eating into my share. However, it's clear Alice is holding firm, and the risk of walking away with nothing is too great now."
