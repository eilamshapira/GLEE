Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns about inflation, but $4000 is too low. I'm proposing a more equitable split of $5500 for me and $4500 for you. Let's work together to find a deal we both agree on quickly.

# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
