"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing to take $6000 and give you $4000. This seems like a fair start given my risk with inflation. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

{
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concerns about inflation, but $4000 is too low. I'm proposing a more equitable split of $5500 for me and $4500 for you. Let's work together to find a deal we both agree on quickly.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, given the inflation affecting me, I propose a 50/50 split this round. We both get $5000, which is fair for both of us. Letâ€™s seal the deal and avoid losing more value. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
