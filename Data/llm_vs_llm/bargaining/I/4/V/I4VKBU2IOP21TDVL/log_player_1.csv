"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that inflation will reduce the value by 20% each round, I should make a reasonable first offer to increase chances of acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which is assertive but not overly greedy. If Bob rejects this, my next opportunity will be worth 20% less, so this is a fair initial offer that gives both of us a substantial portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
- Due to inflation, if I get $50 now, it's actually worth $40 (20% less) for me
- If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, any amount I get will be worth another 20% less
- So in round 3, even if I got $100, it would only be worth $64 to me
- Bob's offer of a 50-50 split is actually disadvantaging me due to the inflation effect
- However, I'm unlikely to get a better outcome by rejecting and going to round 3
