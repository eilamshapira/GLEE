"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40, a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

While the initial offer seems tempting, accepting sets a precedent and may lead to a worse outcome in subsequent rounds if Alice is less generous. By rejecting, I signal a desire for a more equitable split and put the pressure on Alice to make a more appealing offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, a 55/45 split in my favor seems fair considering it's my turn to propose. Let's close this deal!""
}
``` 

This offer is a strong power play that aims to capitalize on my turn to propose. By offering Alice slightly less than she proposed to me, I incentivize her to accept quickly due to the looming threat of inflation. The message is designed to be both confident and persuasive, encouraging Alice to take the deal before the value diminishes further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time to get a better deal, considering the inflation! 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is a tough situation, but Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation factor. Accepting this offer would mean a significant loss compared to my initial potential gain.  I'm banking on Alice being more averse to the risk of further inflation than I am to losing out on this particular offer. Hopefully, she'll propose something more reasonable in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""This back and forth is pointless. Let's stop wasting time and split it evenly. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical solution. Take it while it's still worth something!"" 
}
```

The inflation is starting to become a serious factor. It's time to push for a resolution quickly. By proposing a 50/50 split, I'm offering a fair deal that also emphasizes the urgency of the situation. This straightforward approach might be what's needed to break the stalemate and encourage Alice to accept."
