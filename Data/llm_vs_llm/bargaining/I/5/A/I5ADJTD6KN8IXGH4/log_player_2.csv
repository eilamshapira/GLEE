"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

1. This is the first round, so the money is at full value
2. Alice is offering me 400,000$ (40%) while keeping 600,000$ (60%)
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the total value will decrease by 10%
4. That means next round we'll be dividing 900,000$
5. While I could try to get a better deal, there's a risk of losing more value through negotiation

While the split isn't perfectly equal, 400,000$ is still a substantial amount, and trying to negotiate for more could result in both of us losing money due to inflation. I think it's reasonable enough to accept.
