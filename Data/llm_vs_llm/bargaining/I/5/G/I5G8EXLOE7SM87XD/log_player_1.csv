"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair proposal to Bob in this first round.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose an even 50-50 split where we both receive $500,000. This is a fair division that should be acceptable to both of us."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I notice that Bob is trying to get a larger share for himself. Since I now understand that Bob faces inflation effects (5% per round), I'll make a slightly adjusted offer that accounts for this while still being favorable to me.

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}

I propose a 45-55 split where I receive $450,000 and Bob receives $550,000. This takes into account Bob's inflation concerns while still giving me a substantial portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.
