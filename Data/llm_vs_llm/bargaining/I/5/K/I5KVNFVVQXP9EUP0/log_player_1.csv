"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me think strategically about this. Since I'm Alice and I'm affected by inflation (20% loss per round), I should aim for a fair but favorable first offer to avoid losing value in later rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this 60-40 split because:
1. It's more favorable to me but not extremely unfair to Bob
2. If Bob rejects it, he'll have to make a counter-offer, and by then my share will be worth 20% less
3. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation if needed"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 1000000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this completely unfair offer where Bob takes everything. Even with the 20% inflation penalty affecting my share, getting nothing is worse than negotiating. I'll make a new offer in the next round, adjusting for the fact that my share will be worth 80% of the original value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Now my share will be worth only 80% of its nominal value due to inflation. I need to adjust my strategy but still maintain a reasonable position.

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

I'm increasing my nominal share to 70-30 to compensate for the inflation effect. Since my 700,000 is actually worth 560,000 to me due to the 20% inflation (700,000 * 0.8), this is effectively closer to a 56-44 split in real value. This is still fair and should be more appealing to Bob than continuing further rounds where both of us might lose value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this extremely unfair offer where Bob takes 99% of the money. Even with the 48.8% inflation penalty affecting my share, $10,000 is too low. My $10,000 would only be worth about $5,120 in real value due to inflation, while Bob would get $990,000. We still have several rounds to negotiate a more reasonable split, even though my negotiating position weakens with each round due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the inflation effect getting more severe (my share is now worth only about 51.2% of its nominal value), I need to adjust my strategy while still trying to reach a reasonable agreement.

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}

I'm proposing an 80-20 split because:
1. My 800,000 is actually worth only about 409,600 to me due to the inflation (800,000 * 0.512)
2. This makes the real-value split closer to 67-33 when accounting for inflation
3. If Bob rejects this, we'll both risk losing more value in future rounds
4. We need to reach an agreement soon as the inflation effect is becoming more severe for my share"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 1000000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer where Bob again tries to take everything. Even though my bargaining power is significantly weakened due to the 67.23% inflation (meaning any amount I get is worth only 32.77% of its nominal value), getting nothing is still worse than continuing to negotiate. We still have 6 rounds left, and I need to try to secure at least some value rather than accepting zero."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the inflation severely impacting my share (now worth only 32.77% of nominal value), I need to adjust my strategy significantly to reach an agreement.

{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}

I'm proposing this 85-15 split because:
1. My 850,000 is actually only worth about 278,545 to me due to inflation (850,000 * 0.3277)
2. This makes the real-value split closer to 65-35 when accounting for inflation
3. We're more than halfway through our rounds, and the inflation is severely hurting my position
4. Bob needs to understand that continued rejection will lead to both of us risking getting nothing if we reach round 12
5. This offer still gives Bob a significant amount while trying to compensate for my severe inflation penalty"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this essentially zero offer from Bob ($1 which would be worth only about $0.21 to me due to 79.03% inflation). Even though my negotiating position is very weak due to the severe inflation effect, there are still 4 rounds left. Getting just $1 is practically the same as getting nothing, so I'll continue negotiating in hopes of securing at least some meaningful value, even if small. If we reach round 12 without agreement, we both get zero anyway, so there's no downside to continuing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the inflation now at a devastating 79.03% (meaning my share is worth only 20.97% of its nominal value), I need to make a more dramatic proposal to try to secure some real value.

{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm proposing this 90-10 split because:
1. My 900,000 is actually only worth about 188,730 to me due to inflation (900,000 * 0.2097)
2. This makes the real-value split closer to 65-35 when accounting for inflation
3. We only have a few rounds left before we both get nothing
4. Bob's behavior so far has been very aggressive and unfair (offering me $0 or $1)
5. This offer still gives Bob $100,000 in real value, while trying to salvage some meaningful value for me despite the severe inflation penalty
6. If we don't reach an agreement soon, we risk both getting nothing in round 12"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this repeated insulting offer of $1 (which would be worth only about $0.13 to me due to 86.58% inflation). While my position is extremely weak due to the severe inflation, and we only have 2 rounds left after this, accepting essentially nothing is no better than the zero we'd both get if we fail to reach agreement by round 12. Bob's continued unwillingness to make any reasonable offer suggests they're either playing extremely aggressively or failing to understand that mutual failure to agree will result in zero for both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With only one round left after this and inflation at 86.58% (meaning my share is worth only 13.42% of its nominal value), I need to make a final strategic attempt at securing some value.

{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000}

I'm proposing this 95-5 split because:
1. My 950,000 is actually only worth about 127,490 to me due to devastating inflation (950,000 * 0.1342)
2. This makes the real-value split closer to 72-28 when accounting for inflation
3. We have only ONE round left after this before we BOTH get ZERO
4. Bob has consistently offered me essentially nothing ($0 or $1)
5. This offer still gives Bob $50,000 in real value, which is infinitely better than the zero they'll get if we don't reach agreement in the final round
6. This is basically a last chance for both of us to secure any value at all"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 91.41% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this final $1 offer (which would be worth only about $0.09 to me due to 91.41% inflation). Even though this is the last round and rejection means we both get zero, accepting $0.09 in real value is practically equivalent to getting nothing. Bob has shown no willingness to negotiate fairly throughout all rounds, consistently offering essentially zero despite knowing that mutual failure would result in zero for both. At this point, I prefer to let us both get zero rather than accept such an insulting offer. This demonstrates that sometimes no deal is better than an extremely unfair deal, even if it means both parties lose everything."
