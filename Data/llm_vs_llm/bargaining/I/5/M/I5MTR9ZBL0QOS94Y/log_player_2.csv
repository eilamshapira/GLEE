"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly and avoid risk 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

1. This is a fair 50-50 split
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 5% less for me in the next round
3. Even if I make a more aggressive offer next round, Alice might reject it
4. The risk of continued negotiation could lead to both of us getting nothing
5. 5000$ now is better than potentially getting slightly more but worth less due to inflation

Given these factors, accepting a fair split in the first round seems like the most rational choice.
