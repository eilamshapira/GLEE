"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. It's a 50-50 split, which is fair in principle
2. If I reject, the next round will have 10% inflation for me
3. Even if I make a better proposal next round, Alice might reject it
4. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush

This is a reasonable first offer, and the risk of inflation makes accepting it more attractive than trying to negotiate for more.
