"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I understand this is a negotiation game where I'm Alice, and I need to make an offer to divide $10,000 with Bob. Since I'm going first and considering the different inflation rates (5% for me, 20% for Bob), I'll make a reasonable first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering that if we delay, you lose 20% value per round while I only lose 5%. This way we both walk away with substantial value.""}"
