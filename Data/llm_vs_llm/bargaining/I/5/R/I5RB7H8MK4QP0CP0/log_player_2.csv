"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering that if we delay, you lose 20% value per round while I only lose 5%. This way we both walk away with substantial value. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $4,000 out of the $10,000, while she gets $6,000.

She makes a valid point about the inflation rates - my money loses value faster (20% per round) compared to hers (5% per round). This gives her a strategic advantage in later rounds.

Let me think about this:
- If I reject and propose in round 2, the total value to me would be worth only 80% of the original, so $8,000 equivalent
- Even if I managed to get more in absolute terms in the next round, the inflation might cancel out any gains
- Starting with $4,000 now is better than risking a prolonged negotiation

Given the asymmetric inflation rates, I believe this is actually a reasonable offer considering my disadvantaged position.
