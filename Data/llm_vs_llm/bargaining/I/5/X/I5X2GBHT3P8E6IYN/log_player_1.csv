"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a split that takes into account that Bob's money loses 20% value each round. Since Bob might be tempted to reject and counter-offer, I'll offer a fair amount that makes accepting now more attractive than waiting.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose this split because: If Bob rejects, in the next round his money will be worth 20% less. A fair split now is better than waiting for him."
