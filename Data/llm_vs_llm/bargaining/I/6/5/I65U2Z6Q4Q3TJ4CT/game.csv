7000.0,3000.0,"Bob, consider this: waiting costs you 20% per round while I lose only 10%. Accepting now gets you $3000 in full value rather than risking even lower value later. Let's agree on this fair split and avoid unnecessary losses.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"Alice, I propose $4000 for me and $6000 for you. This split reflects a more balanced approach, considering the different depreciation rates we face. Let's settle at this reasonable division.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, while I appreciate your balanced proposal, I must consider the effect of inflation on my end. Accepting in round 2 gives me an effective value of 6000 × 0.9 = 5400 in today’s money. However, by rejecting your offer, I'll have the opportunity to propose a division in round 3 where I can secure a slightly better deal given my slower rate of devaluation. With my optimal proposal in round 3 (factoring in that each round reduces my value by 10%), I expect to obtain an effective payoff that's higher than 5400. Consequently, I'll have to reject your offer and move to the next round.",Alice,2,reject
9048.0,952.0,"Bob, consider this: if you reject my offer, you'll propose in Round 4, where given your 20% devaluation per round, you can secure about $1429 nominal for yourself—translating to an effective $571 (since 0.4 × 1429 ≈ 571). My current offer gives you $952 nominal, which at your current 0.6 value factor equals roughly $571 as well, ensuring you're just as well off if you accept now. I believe this is a fair division and would prefer to settle now rather than risk further losses. What do you say?",Alice,3,
