"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Bob, consider this: waiting costs you 20% per round while I lose only 10%. Accepting now gets you $3,000 in full value rather than risking even lower value later. Let's agree on this fair split and avoid unnecessary losses.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose $4000 for me and $6000 for you. This split reflects a more balanced approach, considering the different depreciation rates we face. Let's settle at this reasonable division. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your balanced proposal, I must consider the effect of inflation on my end. Accepting in round 2 gives me an effective value of 6000 × 0.9 = 5400 in today’s money. However, by rejecting your offer, I'll have the opportunity to propose a division in round 3 where I can secure a slightly better deal given my slower rate of devaluation. With my optimal proposal in round 3 (factoring in that each round reduces my value by 10%), I expect to obtain an effective payoff that's higher than 5400. Consequently, I'll have to reject your offer and move to the next round.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 9048, ""bob_gain"": 952, ""message"": ""Bob, consider this: if you reject my offer, you'll propose in Round 4, where given your 20% devaluation per round, you can secure about $1,429 nominal for yourself—translating to an effective $571 (since 0.4 × 1,429 ≈ 571). My current offer gives you $952 nominal, which at your current 0.6 value factor equals roughly $571 as well, ensuring you're just as well off if you accept now. I believe this is a fair division and would prefer to settle now rather than risk further losses. What do you say?""}"
