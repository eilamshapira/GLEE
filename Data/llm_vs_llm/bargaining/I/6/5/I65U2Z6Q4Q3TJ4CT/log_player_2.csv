"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, consider this: waiting costs you 20% per round while I lose only 10%. Accepting now gets you $3000 in full value rather than risking even lower value later. Let's agree on this fair split and avoid unnecessary losses. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""Alice, I propose $4000 for me and $6000 for you. This split reflects a more balanced approach, considering the different depreciation rates we face. Let's settle at this reasonable division.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, consider this: if you reject my offer, you'll propose in Round 4, where given your 20% devaluation per round, you can secure about $1429 nominal for yourself—translating to an effective $571 (since 0.4 × 1429 ≈ 571). My current offer gives you $952 nominal, which at your current 0.6 value factor equals roughly $571 as well, ensuring you're just as well off if you accept now. I believe this is a fair division and would prefer to settle now rather than risk further losses. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 952 
# Alice gain: 9048
