"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll play this game as Alice and make my first offer to divide the $10,000.

Given that I face 10% inflation per round, it makes sense to propose a fair but slightly advantageous offer for myself in the first round, since the value will diminish for me if we need additional rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split because it gives me a slight advantage while still being reasonably fair to Bob. Since I know I face inflation in future rounds, getting a deal done now is valuable to me, and this offer respects Bob as a partner in this negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of a 50-50 split. Due to inflation, if I reject this and we go to another round, any amount I might get would be worth 10% less again. The current offer gives me $5000, which is reasonable, and avoiding further inflation makes this a good decision."
