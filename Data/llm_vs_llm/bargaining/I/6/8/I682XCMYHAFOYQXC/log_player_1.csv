Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, I think a 51/49 split is more fair considering I'm taking the risk of rejecting your offer. Let's close this deal before we lose too much to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
