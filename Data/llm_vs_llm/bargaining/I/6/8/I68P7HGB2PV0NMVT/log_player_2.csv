"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. It's a perfectly fair 50-50 split, which is equitable. If I reject, I could try to get more in the next round, but due to the 20% inflation penalty, the total amount would decrease to $80. Even if I managed to get a larger percentage in the next round, the absolute dollar amount might be less than the $50 I'm being offered now.
