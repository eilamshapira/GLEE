900000.0,100000.0,"Let's start fair.  You get 10% and I'll take 90%, we can go from there.",Alice,1,

600000.0,400000.0,"Alice, I understand you aim for a generous share. However, waiting further will cost me dearly due to depreciation. I'm offering you 60% of the pie while I take 40%—a quick settlement that prevents further losses on my end. Let's resolve this now before the value drops even more.",Bob,2,

700000.0,300000.0,"I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need more than 60%.  Let's split the pie 70/30 in my favor.",Alice,3,

690000.0,310000.0,"Alice, I know we both want a fair deal—but every round we wait, my share loses further value. In round 3 you asked for a 70/30 split, but with the continued depreciation I simply can't risk waiting longer. I'm proposing a division of 31% for me and 69% for you. This way, you secure 690K now rather than risking future delays, and we both minimize inflation losses. Let's settle this round and move forward without further erosion of our gains.",Bob,4,
