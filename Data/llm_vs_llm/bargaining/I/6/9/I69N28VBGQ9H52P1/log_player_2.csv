"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split it close to evenly. This way, we both get a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
- She's offering me $40 while keeping $60 for herself
- This is not an even split despite her message suggesting fairness
- If I reject, we'll lose 10% value, making the total $90 for the next round
- However, I'll get to make the next proposal
- Given we have many rounds left, I can still negotiate for a better deal

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split, but still giving Alice a small advantage to encourage acceptance:

{""bob_gain"": 48,
""alice_gain"": 52,
""message"": ""I propose a nearly equal split which is fair for both of us. This way we can both walk away happy and avoid losing money to inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your perspective, Bob. Let's compromise with a slightly adjusted split. This way, we both still get a fair share. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze Alice's new offer:
- She's offering me $45 (worth about $36.45 after 19% inflation) while keeping $55 (worth about $44.55)
- This is a better offer than her first one
- If I reject, we'll lose another 10% value
- We've already gone through 3 rounds, and the value is decreasing
- Alice has shown willingness to compromise by improving her offer
- This is a reasonable split considering the inflation loss
