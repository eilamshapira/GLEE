"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Looking at Alice's offer, she's proposing to give me $40 while she takes $60. 

I need to consider that with each passing round, the money will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation. If I reject now and make a counter-offer in round 2, the total amount will be worth 5% less to me (so $100 becomes worth $95 to me).

Given that I have the disadvantage of inflation affecting only me, it might be reasonable to accept a slightly lower amount now rather than risk further depreciation. However, I believe I can propose a fairer split in the next round, even accounting for the 5% inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a counter-offer that takes into account the inflation penalty I face.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

Given that I'm at a disadvantage with the 5% inflation per round only affecting me, I believe a 50-50 split is fair. This division gives us equal amounts while recognizing that we both need to come to an agreement before inflation erodes my potential gains further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has increased her offer to me from $40 to $45, which is a step in the right direction. However, due to inflation, this $45 is now worth about 9.75% less to me than in the first round.

Let me evaluate this offer:
- $45 with 9.75% inflation means it's effectively worth about $40.61 to me in first-round value
- If I reject and we continue to round 4, my offer would face a 14.26% inflation (5% more)
- The negotiation process seems to be moving toward a more equitable split

Given the increasing inflation penalty I face and the improved offer from Alice, I think accepting this offer is reasonable. Continuing the negotiation further would decrease my effective gains due to inflation, and there's no guarantee Alice would accept a better offer in later rounds.
