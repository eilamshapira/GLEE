550000.0,450000.0,"Let's make this fair and efficient. I propose a 55-45 split, which gives you $450000. Given the 10% inflation penalty per round for you, this is actually the best deal you can get. If we continue negotiating, your share will be worth less each round.",Alice,1,

525000.0,475000.0,"I understand your point about inflation, but I think 55-45 is too skewed in your favor. I propose a 47.5-52.5 split, which is closer to fair. Let's settle this quickly before inflation takes its toll.",Bob,2,

540000.0,460000.0,"I've adjusted my offer to be more favorable to you than my first proposal. At this point, due to 20% cumulative inflation on your end, this $460000 is effectively worth $368000 to you. If we keep negotiating, inflation will continue to reduce your real gains. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances, and we should conclude this now.",Alice,3,

517500.0,482500.0,"I appreciate your adjustment, but I still think we can find a better compromise. Considering the inflation, I'm willing to take a slightly higher share to offset the loss. Let's settle on a 48.25-51.75 split. This is a reasonable offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this.",Bob,4,
