"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's make this fair and efficient. I propose a 55-45 split, which gives you $450,000. Given the 10% inflation penalty per round for you, this is actually the best deal you can get.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your point about inflation, but I think 55-45 is too skewed in your favor. I propose a 47.5-52.5 split, which is closer to fair. Let's settle this quickly before inflation takes its toll. 
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The inflation penalty actually makes this offer less attractive than it appears. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round that considers both our interests while accounting for the inflation effect."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 540000, ""bob_gain"": 460000, ""message"": ""I've adjusted my offer to be more favorable to you than my first proposal. At this point, due to 20% cumulative inflation on your end, this $460,000 is effectively worth $368,000 to you. If we keep negotiating, inflation will continue to reduce your real gains. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances, and we should conclude this now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your adjustment, but I still think we can find a better compromise. Considering the inflation, I'm willing to take a slightly higher share to offset the loss. Let's settle on a 48.25-51.75 split. This is a reasonable offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this. 
# Alice gain: 517500 
# Bob gain: 482500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept this offer. While I could potentially negotiate for a slightly better deal, the risk of further rounds reducing Bob's effective value (and potentially leading to no deal) makes this a reasonable compromise. The 48.25-51.75 split is fair considering the circumstances, and it's better to secure a deal now than risk further negotiations."
