"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make this fair and efficient. I propose a 55-45 split, which gives you $450000. Given the 10% inflation penalty per round for you, this is actually the best deal you can get. If we continue negotiating, your share will be worth less each round.

# Alice gain: 550000

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 475000, 
""alice_gain"": 525000, 
""message"": ""I understand your point about inflation, but I think 55-45 is too skewed in your favor. I propose a 47.5-52.5 split, which is closer to fair. Let's settle this quickly before inflation takes its toll.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've adjusted my offer to be more favorable to you than my first proposal. At this point, due to 20% cumulative inflation on your end, this $460000 is effectively worth $368000 to you. If we keep negotiating, inflation will continue to reduce your real gains. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances, and we should conclude this now.

# Alice gain: 540000
