"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a proposal to divide the $100 between Bob and me.

Given the inflation rates (10% for me, 20% for Bob per round), there's an incentive for both of us to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. A fair offer would acknowledge these different inflation rates.

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This slightly favors me but recognizes that Bob has a higher inflation rate, so he has more incentive to accept now rather than wait for the next round where his money would be worth less."
