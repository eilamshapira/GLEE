"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

* Current value of $45 for me = $45
* If I reject and propose next round:
  * Money loses 20% value for me
  * I could propose a better split, but Alice might reject
  * Any future rejections will reduce value further

This is a reasonable first offer:
- I get 45% which is close to equal
- The loss from waiting a round would reduce my $45 to $36
- Alice is slightly favored but not excessively
