"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being fair, but I need most of the money. Accept and we'll both be happy. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, I'll make a reasonable offer. 

{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'm being generous considering the inflation""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to share, but I need more than your last offer. Let's find a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $200,000 I'd gain is actually worth $128,000 in the first round's value (since 20% less in round 2 and another 20% less of the 80% in round 3, which is 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64). This is a very low offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, and we're already at round 4, I'll make a more aggressive offer to secure a better deal for myself. The money I gain is now worth 48.8% less than in round 1 (20% less in round 2, 20% less of the remaining 80% in round 3, and 20% less of the remaining 64% in round 4, which is 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.512), but I still want to be reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Inflation is killing me, let's find a middle ground before it's too late""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting a little concerned about inflation.  We need to get this done soon. I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go much lower. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $250,000 I'd gain is actually worth approximately $102,400 in the first round's value (since 20% less in round 2, another 20% less of the 80% in round 3, another 20% less of the 64% in round 4, and another 20% less of the 51.2% in round 5, which is 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.4096). This is still a low offer, but I need to consider the rapidly decreasing value of the money for me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 59.04% less for me with each passing round, and we're already at round 6, I'll make a more desperate offer to secure a better deal for myself. The money I gain is now worth approximately 67.2% less than in round 1 (calculating the remaining value after 5 rounds of 20% decrease). I'll try to be more reasonable and split it closer to evenly, hoping Alice will see the urgency.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""We're running out of time, let's split it 50/50 before inflation destroys my share""}"
