"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Based on a backward‐induction analysis (using the fact that if you wait a round your $100 is “discounted” by 10% for me and 20% for Bob), the subgame‐perfect equilibrium shares work out approximately as follows. (The reasoning – which goes many rounds backward – shows that in round 12 Bob can claim almost all of the $100, and then working back through rounds 11, 10, …, 2, we find that in round 1 the proposer – me, Alice – can “keep” about 61.48 and offer Bob about 38.52 [all values in nominal dollars].)

Thus, in Round 1 my equilibrium proposal is:

{""alice_gain"": 61.48, ""bob_gain"": 38.52}

(Any minor rounding differences aside, this offer gives Bob exactly what he would expect to obtain if he rejected—adjusted for his 20% per‐round “inflation” penalty—so he is indifferent between accepting now and waiting. In equilibrium, we expect him to accept.)"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
