"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 38.52 
# Alice gain: 61.48 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the offer, Alice is proposing I get $38.52 while she gets $61.48. This isn't an equal split, but I need to consider the inflation penalty. If I reject, the money will be worth 20% less to me in the next round, while only 10% less for Alice. This gives her a strategic advantage in later rounds.

Let me calculate: If I reject, I would need to propose a split where I get at least $38.52 รท 0.8 = $48.15 in the next round to break even with this offer after inflation.

Given the significant inflation difference between us and the risk of further rounds, I'll make a decision.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair offer that considers our different inflation rates. Since I face 20% inflation per round compared to Alice's 10%, I should propose a split that incentivizes Alice to accept now rather than delay.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'm offering a split where I get $55 and Alice gets $45. This is reasonable because if Alice rejects and we continue to the next round, the money will be worth less to both of us due to inflation. Given that I face higher inflation penalties, this split acknowledges that I need to secure more in earlier rounds while still giving Alice a substantial portion that's better for her to take now than risk decreased value later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 28.57 
# Alice gain: 71.43 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $28.57 while taking $71.43 for herself. I need to factor in the current inflation rates:

- For me, money is now worth 36% less than in round 1
- For Alice, money is now worth 19% less than in round 1

If I were to accept this offer, my actual value would be $28.57 ร 0.64 = $18.28 (in round 1 value).

Alice's previous offer in round 1 would have given me $38.52, which was worth $38.52 in round 1 value.

This current offer is significantly worse than her initial offer, and the split has become even more uneven. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but I'll face even higher inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to make a strategic offer considering our inflation rates. After 4 rounds, my inflation penalty is more severe than Alice's (I'm facing roughly 49% total inflation versus Alice's 27% inflation).

Given this asymmetric inflation and the fact that we've already rejected each other's offers twice, I'll propose a more balanced offer that should be attractive to Alice while still giving me a reasonable amount considering my higher inflation rate.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I'm offering an equal split where we both get $50. This is fair and reasonable given that we're now in round 4. If Alice rejects this, we'll continue to face increased inflation, which hurts me more than her. An equal division represents a genuine compromise that acknowledges both our positions and the need to reach an agreement before the money loses too much value for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 47.77 
# Alice gain: 52.23 
Do you accept this offer?","Analyzing this offer:

Alice is offering me $47.77 while taking $52.23. After accounting for inflation:
- My $47.77 is worth only 40.96% of its original value (59.04% less), so effectively worth $19.57 in round 1 terms
- Alice's $52.23 is worth 65.61% of its original value (34.39% less)

Comparing to previous offers:
- Alice initially offered me $38.52 in round 1 (worth $38.52 in round 1 terms)
- In round 3, she offered me $28.57 (worth $18.28 in round 1 terms)
- Now she's offering $47.77 (worth $19.57 in round 1 terms)

This is only slightly better than her round 3 offer in real terms, but we're now 5 rounds in with 7 remaining. If I reject, inflation will continue to erode value for both of us, with me facing steeper penalties. The split is closer to 50-50 in nominal terms, which shows Alice is becoming more reasonable.
