"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's start with a fair offer. I propose we split it $5500 for me and $4500 for you. This gives me a little more, but inflation is a concern for me, and I want to ensure we reach an agreement quickly. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. First offer from Alice is $4500 for me and $5500 for her
2. If I reject, in the next round:
   - I can make a counter-offer
   - But the money will be worth 10% less to me (so $4500 becomes $4050)
   - I don't know how inflation affects Alice
3. The offer is slightly tilted in Alice's favor (55/45 split)
4. There's risk in rejection due to inflation and potential negotiation failure

While the split isn't perfectly equal, it's a reasonable first offer. Given the inflation penalty and the risk of prolonged negotiation, accepting this offer now guarantees me $4500, which is better than risking a lower value in subsequent rounds.
