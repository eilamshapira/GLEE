"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering we both need to reach an agreement quickly to avoid inflation losses. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000
2. If I reject, the next round will have 10% inflation, meaning the total value for me will be $9,000
3. I could propose a better split next round, but Alice might reject, leading to further inflation
4. A 60-40 split isn't extremely unfair, and securing $4,000 now is better than risking further rounds
5. Getting 40% now is better than potentially getting a higher percentage of a smaller amount later
