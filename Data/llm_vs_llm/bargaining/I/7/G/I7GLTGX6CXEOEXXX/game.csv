5500.0,4500.0,"Given the different inflation rates affecting us (10% for me vs 5% for you), this split is actually very fair. If we continue negotiating, I lose value faster than you do. Let's settle now for mutual benefit.",Alice,3,

5200.0,4800.0,The inflation is significantly hurting both of us - I've already lost 37% of my value while you've lost 19%. This split acknowledges our losses and gives us both a fair amount. Let's end this now before we lose more value.,Alice,5,
