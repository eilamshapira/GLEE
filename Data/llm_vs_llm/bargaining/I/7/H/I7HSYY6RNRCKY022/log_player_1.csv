"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I need to consider the actual value I'll get. 
20% of 450000 is 90000, so the value I'll get is 450000 - 90000 = 360000.
Considering this, I don't think it's a good deal for me.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 20% * 2 = 40% less than the original value (20% less in round 1 and another 20% less in round 2, but it's cumulative, so 20% + 20% - (20% * 20%) = 36%, approximately, I will use 40% for simplicity, but I will calculate it as 36% or 20% + 20% - (20% * 20%) = 0.2 + 0.2 - (0.2 * 0.2) = 0.36), 
and the money Bob gains is worth 5% * 2 = 10% less.
I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 48.8% less, I need to consider the actual value I'll get. 
48.8% of 400000 is 195200, so the value I'll get is 400000 - 195200 = 204800.
Considering this, I think it's still not a good deal for me, but I need to be careful as the inflation is reducing the value of the money quickly.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, I need to act quickly to get a decent share. 
The money I gain is worth 48.8% + 20% - (48.8% * 20%) = 59.36% less than the original value (calculated as 0.488 + 0.2 - (0.488 * 0.2) = 0.5936), 
and the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% + 5% - (14.26% * 5%) = 19.08% less.
I'll try to make a more reasonable offer.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 375000 
# Bob gain: 625000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 67.23% less, I need to consider the actual value I'll get. 
67.23% of 375000 is 252337.5, so the value I'll get is 375000 - 252337.5 = 122662.5.
Considering this, I think it's a very bad deal for me, but I also need to consider that the inflation is reducing the value of the money quickly, and I don't have many rounds left.

Round 7

I'll try to make a reasonable offer, but I need to be more generous to Bob to increase the chances of acceptance.
