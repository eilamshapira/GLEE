"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's make a fair split, with a slight advantage for me since I'm making the first offer. This way we can both walk away with a good amount without risking inflation losses.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time. A fair division will ensure we both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer:
- If I accept now, I'll get $5000 with 5% inflation, so effectively $4750
- If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount I get will be worth another 5% less
- Bob seems willing to negotiate fairly
- We've already used 2 rounds, and with only 12 rounds total, prolonging too much is risky
- A 50-50 split is objectively fair, and getting $4750 is still a good outcome
