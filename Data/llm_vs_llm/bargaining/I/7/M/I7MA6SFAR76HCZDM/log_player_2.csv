"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $300,000 for me, $700,000 for Alice
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
   - The money will be worth 5% less to me
   - Maximum I could get in next round = $950,000 * 0.95 = $902,500
   - But Alice would likely reject a very uneven split
   - Plus further rounds would mean more value loss for me

3. $300,000 is a significant amount, though less than half
4. Given the inflation penalty, securing a decent amount now might be better than risking future rounds

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll take my chances making a counter-offer, as $300,000 is too low for a fair split. The 5% loss is worth the opportunity to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer, but still somewhat in my favor since Alice has the advantage of no inflation penalty:

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I believe this is a fair offer because:
1. It's close to a 50-50 split, which appeals to our sense of fairness
2. I'm offering Alice a substantial sum of $450,000
3. If Alice rejects, she'll need to consider that I'll face a 5% penalty in the next round, which might make me less likely to accept a lower offer
4. The split isn't so extreme that it would likely trigger an emotional rejection"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Current offer: $400,000 for me (worth $361,000 after 9.75% inflation), $600,000 for Alice

2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
   - Money will be worth 14.75% less to me (another 5% decrease)
   - Even if I got $800,000 in the next round, it would be worth $682,000 to me
   - Alice would likely reject such an extreme offer anyway
   - Further rounds mean even more value loss

3. Alice has increased her offer from the initial $300,000 to $400,000
   - This shows willingness to negotiate
   - The real value to me ($361,000) is still substantial

4. The inflation penalty is becoming significant
   - Further delays will substantially reduce my real gains
   - Alice knows she has this advantage

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. The inflation penalty is becoming too costly, and $400,000 (even with the 9.75% reduction) is a reasonable compromise given the circumstances."
