"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer to Bob, considering the inflation penalties we both face.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm proposing a fair split with a slight advantage for me given the higher inflation penalty I face (20% vs. 10%). This way, Bob gets a substantial portion now rather than risking further devaluation by rejecting and moving to the next round."
