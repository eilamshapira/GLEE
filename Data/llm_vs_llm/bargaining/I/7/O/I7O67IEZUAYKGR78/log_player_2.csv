"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

The offer gives me $45 while Alice gets $55. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but:
1. The money will be worth 10% less to me (so $100 becomes worth $90)
2. The money will be worth 20% less to Alice (so $100 becomes worth $80 for her)

$45 right now is better than potentially getting a larger share of a smaller pie. If I reject, Alice might be less likely to accept my counter-offer since the money is worth less to her in the next round.
