"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider the inflation effect on my potential gains if I reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

With the 5% inflation per round, if I reject now, the $1,000,000 will be worth $950,000 to me in the next round. If I propose a better split for myself, Alice might reject it, leading to further rounds and more inflation.

A 50-50 split is fair, and I would receive $500,000. If I reject and try to get more in the next round, I risk getting less due to inflation if negotiations continue for multiple rounds.
