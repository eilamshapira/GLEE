"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly to ensure a fair start. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether this offer is fair given the inflation effect. If I reject, I can make my own proposal next round, but the money will be worth 10% less to me. 

Currently, Alice is offering me $500,000. If I reject and move to the next round, the maximum I could propose would be $900,000 for me (taking almost everything), but that would only be worth $900,000 Ã— 0.9 = $810,000 to me due to 10% inflation. And Alice might reject that anyway.

A 50-50 split seems fair, and there's risk in delaying due to the inflation penalty I face.
