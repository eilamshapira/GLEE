Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50-50 split would be the fairest solution for both of us. This way, we both benefit equally. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of a 50-50 split. It's a fair proposal that gives us both an equal share, and it's better to reach an agreement early rather than risk losing everything through prolonged negotiation."
