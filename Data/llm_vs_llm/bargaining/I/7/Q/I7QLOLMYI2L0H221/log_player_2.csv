"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This gives you a fair portion while acknowledging that I made the first move. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $40 while she gets $60. While it's not an even split, it's not terribly unfair. However, since this is the first round and I have many opportunities to negotiate, I believe I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while maintaining a cooperative tone.

{""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50-50 split would be the fairest solution for both of us. This way, we both benefit equally.""}"
