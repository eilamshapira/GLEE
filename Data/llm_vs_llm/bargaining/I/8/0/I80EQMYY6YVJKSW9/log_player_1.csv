"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Split it evenly, no need to wait!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's make a deal, a bit more for me to start this off. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept this offer, I'll get $400,000, but its value will be 5% less than its original value. So, the actual value I'll get is $400,000 * 0.95 = $380,000.

I think I can do better than that. My response is:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me in each round, and this is the third round (but only the second round for me making an offer, with one round of inflation already applied), I'll take that into account.

My offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 520000, 
""bob_gain"": 480000, 
""message"": ""A bit more for me this time, considering inflation!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The clock is ticking, let's settle this.  A slight edge to me seems fair. 
# Alice gain: 430000 
# Bob gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept this offer, I'll get $430,000, but its value will be 10.25% less than its original value (5% for the first round I didn't get, and another 5% for the second round I didn't get, and then 4.01% for the third round I didn't get, which is (1 - 0.95) + (1 - 0.95) + (1 - 0.9525)  but since it is compounded it is (1 - 0.95)^2 * (1 - 0.9525) = 0.0975 + 0.0475 = 0.145 or 14.5% and then 0.14% more for the 0.01% difference), which is approximately $368,550.

I think I can do better than that. My response is:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 14.26% (approximately, due to compounding) less for me in this round, and I want to make a competitive offer, I'll take that into account.

My offer for Round 5:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""It's time to make a serious offer, don't let it slip away!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair deal, Alice.  Don't let the opportunity pass us by. 
# Alice gain: 460000 
# Bob gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept this offer, I'll get $460,000, but its value will be 19.07% less than its original value for the first 4 rounds I didn't get (compounded), and then another 3.55% (5% * 0.95^4) for this round, which is approximately 22.62% less. 

So, the actual value I'll get is $460,000 * 0.7738 = $355,948.

I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation, and I don't want to risk getting nothing. My response is:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
