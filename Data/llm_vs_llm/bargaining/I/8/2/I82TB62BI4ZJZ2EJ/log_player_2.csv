"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's proposal gives me $40 out of $100, which isn't an equal split. While she's getting a larger share at $60, I should consider that if I reject, we'll go to another round where I can make a counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more even split while being reasonable in my counter-offer.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""I think an equal 50-50 split would be the fairest solution for both of us. This way we both benefit equally from the division.""}"
