55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, let's start with a fair offer that considers our limited rounds. I'm offering 55 for me and 45 for you. This gives us both a good starting point and avoids risking losing everything due to the diminishing value each round. What do you think?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I understand the time crunch with the diminishing value, so how about we switch it up? I'll take 55, you take 45.  It's still a fair deal and gets us moving towards a resolution.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
60.0,40.0,"Bob, I rejected your previous offer. Time is running out and the money's worth is decreasing for both of us. Let's try this: I'll take 60 and you take 40. This acknowledges the inflation's impact on my potential gains in future rounds if we keep negotiating. I hope you find it acceptable.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
50.0,50.0,"Alice, let's stop wasting time. It seems the inflation is affecting you less than me, but it's still a loss for both of us.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both walk away with something substantial.  Let's close this deal.",Bob,4,
