"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I understand the time crunch with the diminishing value, so how about we switch it up? I'll take 55, you take 45.  It's still a fair deal and gets us moving towards a resolution. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55

This acknowledges the inflation's impact on my potential gains in future rounds if we keep negotiating. I hope you find it acceptable.""

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's stop wasting time. It seems the inflation is affecting you less than me, but it's still a loss for both of us.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both walk away with something substantial.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50
