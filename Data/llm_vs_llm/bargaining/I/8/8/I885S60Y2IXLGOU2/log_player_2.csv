"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's start with a fair offer that considers our limited rounds. I'm offering 55 for me and 45 for you. This gives us both a good starting point and avoids risking losing everything due to the diminishing value each round. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I understand the time crunch with the diminishing value, so how about we switch it up? I'll take 55, you take 45.  It's still a fair deal and gets us moving towards a resolution.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I rejected your previous offer. Time is running out and the money's worth is decreasing for both of us. Let's try this: I'll take 60 and you take 40. This acknowledges the inflation's impact on my potential gains in future rounds if we keep negotiating. I hope you find it acceptable. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. It seems the inflation is affecting you less than me, but it's still a loss for both of us.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both walk away with something substantial.  Let's close this deal.""}"
