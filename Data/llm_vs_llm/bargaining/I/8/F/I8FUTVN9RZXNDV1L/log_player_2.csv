I'm aiming a bit higher for myself, and it seems Alice is willing to negotiate.  The decreasing value for her motivates me to hold out a little longer."

This is the same split I offered last round, and while I'd prefer a slightly larger share, the clock is ticking. Accepting now avoids the risk of getting a worse offer or even nothing as the rounds progress."
