"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'd like to propose a fair and mutually beneficial division while accounting for the time pressure and value deterioration.

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose an equal split of $500,000 each. This is fair for both of us, and by accepting now, we both maximize our gains since the money loses 20% value each round. An equal split now is better than trying to negotiate for more over multiple rounds.""}"
