"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's suggesting I get $150,000 while she takes $850,000, which is only 15% of the total for me.

If I reject this offer, I can make a counter-offer in the next round. However, due to 10% inflation, the $1,000,000 will only be worth $900,000 to me in round 2. 

A more equal split would be preferable, and even with inflation, I could propose something more favorable to me in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer, considering the 10% inflation I'm already experiencing.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing an equal 50-50 split of the money. This is fair to both of us and significantly better for me than Alice's initial offer while still being reasonable for her."
