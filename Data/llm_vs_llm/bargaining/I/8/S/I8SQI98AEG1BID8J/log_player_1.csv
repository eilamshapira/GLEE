Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every round you wait costs you 10% of the value. In round 3 you’d be in the proposer’s seat, but you'll have to give me nearly everything to get my acceptance, leaving you with almost nothing. To avoid further loss on your side, I propose a 9999/1 split. I believe this is the best deal you can get. Please accept. 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 9999

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, notice that every round you delay further devalues your share—now your dollars count for only 72.9% of their original worth. If you reject this offer, you'll be the proposer next round, but you'll be forced to give Bob nearly everything since his money doesn’t depreciate. With your alternative worth essentially nothing, I’m offering you a minimal amount. Please accept this 9999/1 split to avoid further loss. 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 9999

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, by rejecting my offer you’d move to round 7 where your dollars are worth only about 53.14% of their face value – effectively reducing any share you claim. In round 7, even if you capture nearly all of the $10000, its real value to you would be around $5314. By accepting this offer in round 6, you get $9000, which—at 59.05% value—yields roughly the same $5315 in real terms, but without further delay or risk. I believe this is the most rational, fair, and efficient split given the inflation dynamics. Please accept. 
# Alice gain: 9000 
# Bob gain: 1000
