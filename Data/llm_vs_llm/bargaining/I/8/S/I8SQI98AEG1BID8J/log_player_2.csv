"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable and split the money fairly, Bob. I believe this is a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 9999, ""alice_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Alice, every round you wait costs you 10% of the value. In round 3 you’d be in the proposer’s seat, but you'll have to give me nearly everything to get my acceptance, leaving you with almost nothing. To avoid further loss on your side, I propose a 9999/1 split. I believe this is the best deal you can get. Please accept.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you overestimate your position and underestimate my resolve. I'm proposing 8000 for me and 2000 for you.  This is the last round where I'm willing to offer you a significant sum. Accept this, and we both walk away with something. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 9999, ""alice_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Alice, notice that every round you delay further devalues your share—now your dollars count for only 72.9% of their original worth. If you reject this offer, you'll be the proposer next round, but you'll be forced to give Bob nearly everything since his money doesn’t depreciate. With your alternative worth essentially nothing, I’m offering you a minimal amount. Please accept this 9999/1 split to avoid further loss.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you've played this well, and I have no choice left.  Take the 9999 and let's end this game. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 9999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Alice, your latest offer leaves me with virtually nothing. I'm no longer willing to settle for a single dollar. Given that my share doesn't suffer any inflation while yours does with each additional round, if I wait until the next round, I can make a proposal that leaves you with an even less valuable amount. I'm rejecting your offer.""}"

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 1000, ""alice_gain"": 9000, ""message"": ""Alice, by rejecting my offer you’d move to round 7 where your dollars are worth only about 53.14% of their face value – effectively reducing any share you claim. In round 7, even if you capture nearly all of the $10,000, its real value to you would be around $5,314. By accepting this offer in round 6, you get $9,000, which—at 59.05% value—yields roughly the same $5,315 in real terms, but without further delay or risk. I believe this is the most rational, fair, and efficient split given the inflation dynamics. Please accept.""}"
