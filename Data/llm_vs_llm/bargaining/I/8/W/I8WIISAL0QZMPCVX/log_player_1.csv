"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to consider that any delay will cost me 10% per round, while Bob doesn't lose value. This gives Bob some leverage, but I should still start with a favorable offer for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. While I could try for more, this offer is fair enough that Bob might accept it immediately, which is important given my 10% penalty per round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept Bob's offer now, I get $450,000 at 90% value = $405,000 effective value
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer, we go to round 3, where any amount I get will be worth only 80% of the original value
3. Even if I could get $600,000 in round 3, it would only be worth $480,000 to me
4. There's no guarantee Bob would accept a better offer, and further rounds would decrease my value even more

Given these factors, I should accept this offer. While it's not as good as my initial proposal, it's better than risking further devaluation.
