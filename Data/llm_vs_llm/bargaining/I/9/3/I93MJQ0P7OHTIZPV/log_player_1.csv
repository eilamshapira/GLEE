# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking for a more balanced split. Due to the 10% inflation penalty I face with each round, I'm proposing this adjusted division that I believe is fair for both of us. This way we can conclude quickly and both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500
