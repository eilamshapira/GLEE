"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split is fair and benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000 out of the total $10,000. 

If I reject this offer, I'll make a counter-offer in the next round, but the money will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation. That means the full $10,000 would effectively be worth $9,000 to me in the next round.

Given that I would only get $4,000 now, versus potentially negotiating for more of an effective $9,000 in the next round, I think I should reject this offer and make a counter-proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that considers both the inflation effect and fairness.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking for a more balanced split. Due to the 10% inflation penalty I face with each round, I'm proposing this adjusted division that I believe is fair for both of us. This way we can conclude quickly and both benefit.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about inflation. However, my initial offer was already taking that into account. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need you to acknowledge that waiting benefits neither of us. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this new offer carefully.

Alice is now offering me $4,500 while she takes $5,500. However, due to the inflation effect, the $4,500 is worth 19% less to me than it would have been in the first round, which means it's effectively worth about $3,645 in first-round terms.

If I reject this offer, we'll move to round 4, where I can make another counter-offer. But the inflation will increase to approximately 27% (compounding the 10% each round), making the entire $10,000 worth only about $7,300 to me.

Since Alice has moved $500 in my direction from her initial offer, and further delays will significantly reduce the value to me, I'll accept this offer.
