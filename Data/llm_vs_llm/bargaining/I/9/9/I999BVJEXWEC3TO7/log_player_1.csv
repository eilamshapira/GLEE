"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering I'm making the first move, and if we delay, we both lose money due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the difference. 55/45 ensures we both benefit from a quick agreement. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer. This is a reasonable compromise, and with the 20% inflation penalty already in effect, it's better to agree now than risk further devaluation of the money in subsequent rounds."
