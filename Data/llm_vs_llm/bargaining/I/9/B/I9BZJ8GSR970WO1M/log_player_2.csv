"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. Let's take the sure thing.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. It's a fair starting point for negotiations considering the inflation.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's meet in the middle. I'll take 550k, you get 450k. Inflation is hurting me more. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

While I would prefer a slightly better split, accepting this offer guarantees a reasonable sum and avoids the risk of losing everything to inflation. Alice clearly feels the pressure of inflation, which worked to my advantage this round."
