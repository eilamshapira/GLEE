"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I take $52.63 while you receive $47.37. This split takes into account the future discounting of the pie, ensuring you get at least what you'd expect if you waited for your turn to propose. Letâ€™s settle now before further rounds reduce our gains. 
# Bob gain: 47.37 
# Alice gain: 52.63 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether I should accept this offer, let's consider the potential outcomes if I reject it and wait for my turn to propose.

If I reject this offer, the money will be worth 10% less in the next round. This means instead of dividing $100, we will be dividing $90.

As the proposer in the next round, I could potentially offer Alice a smaller amount, say $40, and keep $50 for myself. However, I need to consider whether Alice would accept such an offer, given that she knows the value of the money will decrease further if she rejects it.

Given Alice's initial offer of $47.37 to me, it seems she is trying to be somewhat generous to avoid the risk of further depreciation. Her offer is close to, but slightly above, what I might expect if we were to split the money evenly after accounting for the depreciation.

Considering these factors, I think Alice's initial offer is reasonable, and it might be in my best interest to accept it rather than risking further depreciation of the money.
