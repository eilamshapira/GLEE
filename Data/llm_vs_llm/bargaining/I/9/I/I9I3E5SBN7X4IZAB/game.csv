600000.0,400000.0,I propose a 60-40 split considering our different inflation rates. This is fair since my money loses value much faster than yours (20% vs 5% per round). Let's settle this now and both walk away with a good deal.,Alice,1,

500000.0,500000.0,"Let's split the amount equally. This ensures a fair deal for both of us as your inflation rate is higher, but we're still early in the game.",Bob,2,

650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, let's be rational. We're now in round 3, and my money has already lost 40% of its value while yours only lost 10%. A 65-35 split is actually very fair when accounting for these inflation rates. If we keep going, we'll both lose more value. Let's conclude this now.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"I understand the inflation challenges. Here's a slightly better deal for you, and it still respects the inflated value loss on both sides. Let's settle this in a way that benefits both.",Bob,4,
