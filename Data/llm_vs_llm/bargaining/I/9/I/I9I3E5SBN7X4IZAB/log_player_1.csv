Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the amount equally. This ensures a fair deal for both of us as your inflation rate is higher, but we're still early in the game. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The equal split doesn't account for the significant difference in our inflation rates. My money loses value much faster (20% vs 5% per round), and we're already in round 2 where my potential gains are worth 20% less. I'll make a better proposal in the next round."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the inflation challenges. Here's a slightly better deal for you, and it still respects the inflated value loss on both sides. Let's settle this in a way that benefits both. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While I could try to negotiate for more, the risk of continued inflation is too high. At this point, my $550,000 is worth about $281,600 in original value (due to 48.8% inflation), and further rounds would erode this value even more drastically. Bob's offer shows some understanding of the inflation disparity, and it's better to secure this deal now than risk further value loss."
