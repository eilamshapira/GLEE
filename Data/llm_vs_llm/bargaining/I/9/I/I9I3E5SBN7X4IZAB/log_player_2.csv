"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60-40 split considering our different inflation rates. This is fair since my money loses value much faster than yours (20% vs 5% per round). Let's settle this now and both walk away with a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split the amount equally. This ensures a fair deal for both of us as your inflation rate is higher, but we're still early in the game.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be rational. We're now in round 3, and my money has already lost 40% of its value while yours only lost 10%. A 65-35 split is actually very fair when accounting for these inflation rates. If we keep going, we'll both lose more value. Let's conclude this now. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I understand the inflation challenges. Here's a slightly better deal for you, and it still respects the inflated value loss on both sides. Let's settle this in a way that benefits both.""}"
