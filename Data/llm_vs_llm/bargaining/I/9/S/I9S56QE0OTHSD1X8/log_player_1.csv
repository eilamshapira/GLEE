"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to propose a division of $100, keeping in mind the decreasing value of the money for both of us with each round. Since it's round 1, I'll try to be somewhat fair but also ensure I get a good portion, as I'll have to accept Bob's offer in later rounds if necessary.

Here's my proposal:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40}
```

My reasoning: I am offering Bob 40% of the money upfront in Round 1. This gives him a significant amount. I am keeping 60% for myself, which seems a little greedy but accounts for the decreasing value in later rounds."
