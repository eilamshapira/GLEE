55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob! I'm suggesting a 55/45 split. Since you face 20% inflation per round while I don't, accepting now gives you maximum value. If we go to round 2, your $45 would only be worth $36 to you, and even less in later rounds. This is a fair offer considering our different inflation rates.",Alice,1,

50.0,50.0,"Hi Alice! I'm proposing an equal 50/50 split this round. This way, we both walk away with an even share. Given the inflation factor for me, it's a fair and straightforward solution that benefits us both equally.",Bob,2,

60.0,40.0,"Bob, considering the inflation you face, we need to make a decision quickly. At round 3, you're already facing 40% cumulative inflation. This 60/40 split gives you $40 now, which is worth more than a larger amount in future rounds. If we go another round, your real value will decrease further. This is better for you than continuing to negotiate.",Alice,3,
