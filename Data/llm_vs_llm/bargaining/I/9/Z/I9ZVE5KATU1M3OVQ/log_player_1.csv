"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll propose a fair division considering the inflation impact on Bob's future value.

{""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm suggesting a 55/45 split. Since you face 20% inflation per round while I don't, accepting now gives you maximum value. If we go to round 2, your $45 would only be worth $36 to you, and even less in later rounds. This is a fair offer considering our different inflation rates.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice! I'm proposing an equal 50/50 split this round. This way, we both walk away with an even share. Given the inflation factor for me, it's a fair and straightforward solution that benefits us both equally. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Bob, considering the inflation you face, we need to make a decision quickly. At round 3, you're already facing 40% cumulative inflation. This 60/40 split gives you $40 now, which is worth more than a larger amount in future rounds. If we go another round, your real value will decrease further. This is better for you than continuing to negotiate.""}"
