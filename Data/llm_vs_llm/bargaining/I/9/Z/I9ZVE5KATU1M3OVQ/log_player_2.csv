"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm suggesting a 55/45 split. Since you face 20% inflation per round while I don't, accepting now gives you maximum value. If we go to round 2, your $45 would only be worth $36 to you, and even less in later rounds. This is a fair offer considering our different inflation rates. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Hi Alice! I'm proposing an equal 50/50 split this round. This way, we both walk away with an even share. Given the inflation factor for me, it's a fair and straightforward solution that benefits us both equally.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering the inflation you face, we need to make a decision quickly. At round 3, you're already facing 40% cumulative inflation. This 60/40 split gives you $40 now, which is worth more than a larger amount in future rounds. If we go another round, your real value will decrease further. This is better for you than continuing to negotiate. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60
