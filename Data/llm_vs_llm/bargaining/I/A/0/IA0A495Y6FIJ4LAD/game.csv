714285.71,285714.29,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a division that reflects our different rates of discounting. If we settle now, you'll get about 28.6% of the total – a fair outcome considering that delay costs you 20% per round while it costs me 10%. I believe this is a rational and equitable offer for both of us. Let's agree now and avoid any further loss in value.",Alice,1,

360000.0,640000.0,"Alice, I understand that rejecting your offer will mean a loss for both of us. However, I believe my proposal reflects the diminishing value of the money for me. Take it or leave it.",Bob,2,

714285.71,285714.29,"Hi Bob, now that we are in round 3, every minute of delay is costly for both of us – especially for you, given your 20% per‐round loss. Based on our problem’s structure and a bit of backward induction, if you reject, you’ll get to propose in round 4. However, even with the proposer’s advantage, discounting will leave you roughly with the same utility as accepting this offer. In this proposal, I’m allocating $285714.29 to you and $714285.71 to myself. Accepting now ensures you lock in your current value, whereas waiting further only diminishes the total value available. I hope you’ll see the logic in avoiding additional loss and accept this fair division.",Alice,3,

511718.75,488281.25,"Hi Bob, as we move into round 5 the cost of delay is really starting to bite – my money loses only 10% per round while yours loses 20%. I’ve calculated a proposal that, after discounting, gives you roughly the same effective value as you’d expect if you waited to propose in round 6. Concretely, this division means you’d secure an effective value of about $200000 while locking me in at about $335000 – amounts that reflect your more acute time‐sensitivity. I believe this is a fair and strategically sound offer given our remaining rounds. Let’s settle now and avoid further erosion of our gains.",Alice,5,

488000.0,512000.0,"Hi Bob, as we enter round 7 the cost of delay intensifies – my share is now valued at 0.9^6 (about 53.14% of nominal) and yours at 0.8^6 (roughly 26.21% of nominal). If you reject today, you'll become the proposer in round 8, but then the further discount will diminish your effective value even more. To make settling now appealing, I’m offering you a nominal $512000 – which, at this round’s discount for you, yields an effective value of approximately $134218, roughly matching what you could expect if you waited. In turn, I receive $488000 (an effective value of about $259431). I believe this division fairly reflects our differing discount rates and the urgency imposed by the diminishing value. Let’s end this now before further erosion sets in.",Alice,7,

344000.0,656000.0,"Hi Bob, we’re now in round 9. If you reject my offer, you’ll become the proposer in round 10, and based on our discount factors you can secure an effective value corresponding to a nominal amount of about $820000—but when discounted at 0.8^(9) that gives you roughly $110000 effective. To keep you indifferent and ensure no further loss due to waiting, I’m offering you $656000 nominal now (since $656000 × 0.8^(8) ≈ $110000 effective), and I’ll take $344000 nominal. This way, both of us lock in a better value than risking further erosion. I hope you agree to settle now.",Alice,9,
