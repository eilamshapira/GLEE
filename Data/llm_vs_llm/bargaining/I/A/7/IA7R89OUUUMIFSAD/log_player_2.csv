"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 50-50 split which is fair for both of us. If we keep rejecting offers, we'll both lose money due to the 20% inflation penalty per round. Let's make this simple and efficient. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer carefully.

Alice has proposed a 50-50 split, which would give each of us $500,000. This is a perfectly fair first offer that recognizes our equal positions in this negotiation.

She's right about the inflation penalty - if we reject offers and extend the game, the total value decreases by 20% each round. By round 5, we'd already lose over 67% of the initial value.

Given that:
1. The offer is equitable
2. We face significant penalties for delay
3. This is the first round, so the money still has its full value
