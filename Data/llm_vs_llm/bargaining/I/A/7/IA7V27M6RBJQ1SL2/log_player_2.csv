Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your initial offer, but considering the inflation effect on me, I think a 55-45 split in my favor is more reasonable. Let's find a middle ground.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's meet closer to the middle. With inflation affecting my gains, I propose a 52-48 split. This is a fair compromise from both our previous positions, and we should reach an agreement soon to avoid further value loss. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
