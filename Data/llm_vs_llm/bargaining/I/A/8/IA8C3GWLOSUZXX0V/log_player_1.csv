"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to split things fairly. However, with the inflation hit already in play, further delays will only shrink our total. I'm offering 5200 for me and 4800 for youâ€”a fair counter-proposal that minimizes losses from inflation. Let's agree now rather than risk a lower total later. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
