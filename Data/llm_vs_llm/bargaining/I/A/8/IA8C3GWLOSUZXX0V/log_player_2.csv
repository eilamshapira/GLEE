Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, giving me a slight edge for proposing first. Accept this and we both win!

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to split things fairly. However, with the inflation hit already in play, further delays will only shrink our total. I'm offering 5200 for me and 4800 for youâ€”a fair counter-proposal that minimizes losses from inflation. Let's agree now rather than risk a lower total later.""}"
