Alice is sticking stubbornly close to her initial offer.  While the shrinking pot is a concern, it's worth holding out a bit longer to see if I can get her to move closer to a more even split."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 800000

Alice is being very stubborn, but I'm willing to risk it. The inflation is hurting, but getting less than a quarter of the pot would be a terrible deal.  I need to show her I'm serious about getting a more even split."
