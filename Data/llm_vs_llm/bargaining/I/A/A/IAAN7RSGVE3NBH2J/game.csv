600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, considering the inflation affecting your gains, we should finish this quickly. I'm offering you $400000 now, which is better than getting less value in future rounds due to increasing inflation. This is a fair deal given the circumstances.",Alice,3,

520000.0,480000.0,"Alice, I'm feeling the inflation pressure, but I need a bit more security.  How about a 48/52 split?  It's a compromise, and we can wrap this up.",Bob,4,
