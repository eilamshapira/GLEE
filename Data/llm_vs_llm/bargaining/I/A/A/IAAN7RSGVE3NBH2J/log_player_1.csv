"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split where I get 55% and you get 45%. This is a reasonable offer that benefits both of us without dragging this out.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I believe a 55/45 split in my favor is more reflective of the potential risk for me with inflation. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Rationale (not part of response): I should reject because:
1. I know the money's value for me doesn't decrease
2. Bob's money is worth 20% less this round
3. If I make a counter-offer, I can likely get a better deal since Bob is facing increasing pressure from inflation
4. Bob's current offer would give me less than my initial offer, which isn't acceptable given I'm not affected by inflation"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Bob, considering the inflation affecting your gains, we should finish this quickly. I'm offering you $400,000 now, which is better than getting less value in future rounds due to increasing inflation. This is a fair deal given the circumstances.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm feeling the inflation pressure, but I need a bit more security.  How about a 48/52 split?  It's a compromise, and we can wrap this up. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Rationale (not part of response): I should reject because:
1. Bob's money is now worth 48.8% less, putting them in a much weaker position
2. Their $480,000 is actually worth only about $246,000 to them due to inflation
3. I can likely get an even better deal in the next round as Bob's position continues to weaken
4. Since my money maintains its value, I have a stronger negotiating position"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Bob, the inflation is severely impacting your potential gains. Your $300,000 now is worth more than a larger number in future rounds due to increasing inflation. Let's conclude this now before further devaluation of your share.""}"
