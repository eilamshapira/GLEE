"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 34, ""bob_gain"": 66, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, to avoid further devaluation we should settle now. Given that with each round our money loses value (10% for me and 5% for you), I’m proposing a division that reflects our different discount rates. I keep $34 and you receive $66 – a fair split that leaves you slightly better off than if you waited to make your proposal. I hope you agree to secure our shares before further losses occur.""}"
