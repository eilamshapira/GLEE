264908.0,735092.0,"Hi Bob – To avoid further losses (since every extra round costs you 5% of the dollar‐value), I propose we settle right away. Based on a backward‐induction analysis of our 12‐round game, this division (I get $264908 and you get $735092) gives you exactly as much as you’d expect to earn by waiting another round. Please accept this offer so we can both avoid the inflation penalty.",Alice,1,
