"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob – To avoid further losses (since every extra round costs you 5% of the dollar‐value), I propose we settle right away. Based on a backward‐induction analysis of our 12‐round game, this division (I get $264908 and you get $735092) gives you exactly as much as you’d expect to earn by waiting another round. Please accept this offer so we can both avoid the inflation penalty. 
# Bob gain: 735092 
# Alice gain: 264908 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether I should accept this offer, let's analyze the situation.

If I accept, I get $735,092.

If I reject, the money will be worth 5% less to me in the next round. This means that the total amount of $1,000,000 will be worth $950,000 to me in the next round.

Since Alice's offer gives me $735,092, which is more than 73.5% of $1,000,000, I should consider whether I can get a better deal in the next round.

However, considering the inflation penalty and the fact that Alice's offer is based on a backward-induction analysis, it seems that her offer is reasonable.

Given that I have 12 rounds to divide the money and the inflation penalty, I think it's a good idea to accept this offer to avoid further losses.
