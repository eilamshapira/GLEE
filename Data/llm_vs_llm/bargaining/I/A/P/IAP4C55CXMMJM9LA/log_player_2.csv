"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each round, I'll try to make a fair offer. Considering the initial amount is $10,000, after one round, it's worth $8,000 for me (20% less).

My offer:
{""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""alice_gain"": 5500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect on me, the $4200 I would gain is worth approximately 64% of its original value (100% - 36% = 64%). So, the $4200 is equivalent to $4200 * 0.64 = $2688 in the original value.

Given this, I'll evaluate the offer.
