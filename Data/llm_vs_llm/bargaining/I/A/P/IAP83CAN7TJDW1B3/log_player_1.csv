"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to divide the $1,000,000 with Bob, considering we need to reach an agreement before inflation erodes our potential gains.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a perfectly fair 50-50 split. This maximizes our collective value and ensures we both walk away with an equal share. With inflation at 5% per round, it's in both our interests to agree early.""}"
