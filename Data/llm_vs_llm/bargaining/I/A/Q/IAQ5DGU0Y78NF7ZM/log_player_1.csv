"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's calculate the value of Alice's gain considering the 5% inflation.

In Round 1, Alice would have received $600,000. Now, due to inflation, any amount I receive is worth less.

I need to calculate the real value of the offered $450,000.

Since the money is worth 5% less, my share is now worth: $450,000 * 0.95 = $427,500.

Given that I need to make a decision, and I have rejected before.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 3, taking into account the inflation from rounds 1 and 2:

The original value of the money has decreased due to inflation. The money now is worth 10% less to me than in the beginning.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
