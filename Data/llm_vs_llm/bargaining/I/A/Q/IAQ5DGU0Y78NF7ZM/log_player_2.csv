"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer gives me $400,000 out of $1,000,000 (40%)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, the money will be worth less next round
4. $400,000 now vs. potentially more but worth 5% less next round
5. With 12 rounds available, there's room for negotiation, but the inflation penalty is significant

The offer isn't great, but the inflation penalty makes delay costly. However, I think I can get a better deal even accounting for inflation. In the next round, I can propose a more equitable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split, but considering that I've already lost 5% value due to inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher portion to compensate:

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

This offer is more equitable than Alice's initial proposal, giving me 55% and Alice 45%. It's a reasonable counter-offer that:
1. Compensates for my 5% loss from inflation
2. Is not too aggressive to risk multiple rejections
3. Still leaves Alice with a substantial amount
4. Shows willingness to negotiate while standing firm on fair treatment"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice has improved her offer from $400,000 to $450,000 for me
2. The inflation penalty is now 9.75%, meaning:
   * $450,000 Ã— (1 - 0.0975) = $406,125 in real value
3. This is slightly better than her first offer in real terms
4. If I reject, the next round will have a 14.26% inflation penalty
5. We've used 3 of 12 rounds, still room to negotiate but inflation is becoming significant
6. Alice seems willing to negotiate, but another round means substantial value loss

Given the significant inflation penalty and the improved offer, I think it's rational to accept now. Further negotiation might lead to diminishing returns due to inflation.
