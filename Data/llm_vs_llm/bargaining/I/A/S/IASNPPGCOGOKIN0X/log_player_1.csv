"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer in this round considering the inflation that affects me but not Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

Given the 10% inflation that affects only me with each passing round, I think this is a fair initial offer. Bob gets a substantial portion, and I get a bit more to account for the fact that delaying would hurt me more than him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to consider the inflation affects more carefully, as we're now in round 3 and my money is worth 20% less than in round 1.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a bit more than my initial proposal. Since the value of money decreases for me with each round, it's important we reach an agreement soon. This offer gives Bob a significant portion while still allowing me to receive a reasonable amount considering the inflation effects."
