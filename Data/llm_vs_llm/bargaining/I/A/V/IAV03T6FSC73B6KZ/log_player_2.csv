"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly down the middle, Bob. 500000 for each of us. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I appreciate the offer Alice, but I think I deserve a bit more for going first. How about a 60/40 split in my favor?""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, since you feel you deserve more, how about a 55/45 split in your favor? I think this is a fair compromise considering we're losing rounds. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

At this point, it's better to accept a slightly less favorable deal. The inflation is cutting into my potential gains each round, and there's no guarantee I can negotiate a better deal with Alice later."
