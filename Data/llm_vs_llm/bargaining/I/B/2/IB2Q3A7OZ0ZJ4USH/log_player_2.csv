I'm rejecting this offer because it's not improving quickly enough for me.  While Alice is taking a very small hit each round, my potential gains are dropping substantially. I need to push for a better split before the inflation makes it meaningless."

This is getting dangerous, but I need to hold firm a bit longer. Accepting this offer at this stage of the game would leave me with very little profit after inflation."

The effects of inflation are becoming too severe.  While this is far from ideal, taking the offer now is better than risking getting nothing, or being forced to accept an even lower amount in later rounds."
