"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 95 
# Alice gain: 5 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
- Alice is offering me $95, which is a very favorable split
- If I reject, we move to next round where:
  - The money loses 5% value for me (my $95 becomes worth ~$90.25)
  - Money loses 20% value for Alice
  - I get to make the next offer
- Given I'm being offered 95% of the pot right away, this is quite generous and I'm unlikely to do significantly better
