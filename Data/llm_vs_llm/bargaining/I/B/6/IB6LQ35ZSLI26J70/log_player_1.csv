{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This is a reasonable starting point, considering I make the first offer. Let's avoid the inflation penalty and agree now.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is too biased. Considering the inflation penalty, I'm willing to take a bit more. Let's settle on 55/45 and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
