"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, 55/45 is fairer! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $4500, but it's worth 20% less than the original value. So, the actual value I'll get is $4500 * 0.8 = $3600.

Since this is the first offer from Bob, I'll think carefully before making a decision.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 20% * 2 = 40% less than the original value (20% less in Round 1 and another 20% less in Round 2, but compounded it is 36% less, I will use 40% for simplicity, but the actual calculation will be 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64), and the money Bob gains is worth 5% * 2 = 10% less than the original value (5% less in Round 1 and another 5% less in Round 2).

To make a more attractive offer, I'll give Bob a bit more:

{""alice_gain"": 4200, 
""bob_gain"": 5800, 
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, I'm compromising here!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering inflation, 60/40 is the new fair! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! Considering the inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $4000, but it's worth 48.8% less than the original value. So, the actual value I'll get is $4000 * 0.512 = $2048.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I need to think about the alternatives. If I reject this offer, the inflation will continue to erode the value of the money, and I might end up with even less.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 59.05% less than the original value (calculated as 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.512, but for simplicity, I will calculate it as 0.8^4 = 0.4096, so 100% - 40.96% = 59.04%), and the money Bob gains is worth 19.08% less than the original value (calculated as 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.8574, but for simplicity, I will calculate it as 0.95^4 = 0.8145, so 100% - 81.45% = 18.55%).

To make a more attractive offer, I'll give Bob a bit less this time:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Equal split, it's only fair now!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is on my side, 65/35 is the new reality! 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! Considering the inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $3500, but it's worth 67.23% less than the original value. So, the actual value I'll get is $3500 * 0.3277 = $1146.95.

I'm not happy about this offer, but I need to think about the alternatives. If I reject this offer, the inflation will continue to erode the value of the money, and I might end up with even less. Bob's offer is quite biased in his favor, but I have to consider the rapidly decreasing value of the money.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 74.08% less than the original value (calculated as 0.8^6 = 0.2621, so 100% - 26.21% = 73.79%, but for this example, I will use 74.08%), and the money Bob gains is worth 26.87% less than the original value (calculated as 0.95^6 = 0.7354, so 100% - 73.54% = 26.46%, but for this example, I will use 26.87%).

To make a more attractive offer, I'll try to find a middle ground:

{""alice_gain"": 4800, 
""bob_gain"": 5200, 
""message"": ""Let's find a compromise before it's too late!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, and inflation is biting, 70/30 is my final push! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! Considering the inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $3000, but it's worth 79.03% less than the original value. So, the actual value I'll get is $3000 * 0.2097 = $629.1.

I'm extremely unhappy about this offer, but I have to consider the rapidly decreasing value of the money. Bob's offer is very biased in his favor, and I'm starting to think that I might not get a better deal. The inflation is severely eroding the value of the money, and I need to think about cutting my losses.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 83.28% less than the original value (calculated as 0.8^8 = 0.1678, so 100% - 16.78% = 83.22%, but for this example, I will use 83.28%), and the money Bob gains is worth 33.44% less than the original value (calculated as 0.95^8 = 0.6634, so 100% - 66.34% = 33.66%, but for this example, I will use 33.44%).

To make a more attractive offer, I'll try to be more generous:

{""alice_gain"": 4000, 
""bob_gain"": 6000, 
""message"": ""Last chance for a reasonable split, let's not leave with nothing!""}"
