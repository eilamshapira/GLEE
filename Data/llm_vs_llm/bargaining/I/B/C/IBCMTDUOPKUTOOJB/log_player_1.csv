"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to think strategically about this game. Since the money is worth the same to me in every round, but it's worth 10% less to Bob each round, I have a slight advantage by being patient. Bob should be more eager to finish earlier.

For my first offer, I'll propose a split that's slightly in my favor but still reasonable enough that Bob might accept it to avoid the 10% loss in value.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this division because it gives both of us a substantial amount, while acknowledging my slight advantage in the game structure. The 55/45 split seems fair considering that if Bob rejects, he risks losing value in the next round."
