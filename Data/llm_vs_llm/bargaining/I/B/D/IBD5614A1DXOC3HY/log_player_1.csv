"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, 50/50 is the fairest split, but I'm willing to give you a bit less than I deserve. Don't let inflation eat away our money! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
