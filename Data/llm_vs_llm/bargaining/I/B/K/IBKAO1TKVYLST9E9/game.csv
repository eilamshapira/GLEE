550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I understand you want more than an even split, but I need to look out for my interests too. Due to the 20% inflation affecting your gains, this offer actually gives you the equivalent of 360000 in round 1 value. If we continue to another round, inflation will reduce your purchasing power even further. This is a reasonable compromise that acknowledges your contributions while being fair to both of us.",Alice,3,
