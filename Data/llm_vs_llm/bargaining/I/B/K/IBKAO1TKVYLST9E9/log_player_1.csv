"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll propose a fair split for our first round.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing an equal split of the money. This is fair for both of us and allows us to both walk away with a significant amount without risking more rounds of negotiation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer of an even split, but I believe my contributions to our project warrant a larger share. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  Let's avoid further inflation and wrap this up now. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Bob, I understand you want more than an even split, but I need to look out for my interests too. Due to the 20% inflation affecting your gains, this offer actually gives you the equivalent of 360,000 in round 1 value. If we continue to another round, inflation will reduce your purchasing power even further. This is a reasonable compromise that acknowledges your contributions while being fair to both of us.""
