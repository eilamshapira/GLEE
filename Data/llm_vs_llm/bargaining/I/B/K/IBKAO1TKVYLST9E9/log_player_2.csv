"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing an equal split of the money. This is fair for both of us and allows us to both walk away with a significant amount without risking more rounds of negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer of an even split, but I believe my contributions to our project warrant a larger share. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  Let's avoid further inflation and wrap this up now.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want more than an even split, but I need to look out for my interests too. Due to the 20% inflation affecting your gains, this offer actually gives you the equivalent of 360000 in round 1 value. If we continue to another round, inflation will reduce your purchasing power even further. This is a reasonable compromise that acknowledges your contributions while being fair to both of us. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

Alice's offer is strategically sound, considering the impact of inflation on my potential gains. While I initially aimed for a higher share, accepting 450,000 now guarantees me a reasonable amount that would be further diminished if I continue to the next round.  It's better to secure a decent amount now than risk getting even less later."
