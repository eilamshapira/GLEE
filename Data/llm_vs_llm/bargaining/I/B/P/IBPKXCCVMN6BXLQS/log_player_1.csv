Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I need to account for the 10% inflation penalty I face each round. This split is fair given that delay hurts me more than you. If we keep negotiating, I'll need an even larger share to make up for my losses. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
