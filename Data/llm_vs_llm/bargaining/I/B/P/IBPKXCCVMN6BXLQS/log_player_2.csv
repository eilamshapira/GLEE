"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take 60 and you get 40. Deal? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's offering me $40 out of the $100, which seems unbalanced in her favor, especially since I face a 10% penalty each round while she doesn't. 

If I reject and make a counter-offer, I'll have the advantage of proposing next, but the total value to me will decrease by 10%.

Let me calculate: If I reject, the $100 becomes worth $90 to me in the next round. I could then propose a more favorable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that acknowledges the time pressure I face with the 10% penalty per round.

{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Alice, I need to account for the 10% inflation penalty I face each round. This split is fair given that delay hurts me more than you. If we keep negotiating, I'll need an even larger share to make up for my losses.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation hurts you, but my offer is more than fair. Let's close this deal now and both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's new offer. She's now offering me $45, which is more than her initial offer of $40.

With the 19% inflation penalty in this round, $45 is worth approximately $36.45 to me in first-round value. If I reject and we continue to round 4, the penalty increases to 27.1%, meaning each dollar will be worth only about 72.9 cents to me.

Alice has moved significantly from her initial position, offering me 5% more of the total. Given the increasing inflation penalty I face, accepting now rather than continuing to negotiate is probably in my best interest.
