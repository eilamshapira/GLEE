"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value I'd get is 45 * 0.64 = 28.8 (since it's 36% less than the original, which is equivalent to 64% of the original value). 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Due to inflation, the money I gain is worth 36% less than in the first round, and it will be worth even less in this round (40% less, since 20% less in round 2 and another 20% less in round 3, combined is 36%, and now another 20% less, which is 1 - (1 - 0.2)(1 - 0.36) = 0.488, or approximately 51.2% of the original value, but I will calculate it as 40% less, which is 60% of the original value, to simplify).

I'll make an offer, taking into account the reduced value.
