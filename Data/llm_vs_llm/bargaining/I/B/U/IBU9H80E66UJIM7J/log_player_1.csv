"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make my initial offer to Bob in this first round, aiming for a fair division while considering the different inflation rates.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 50-50 split which seems fair to start. Since my inflation rate (10%) is higher than yours (5%), there's incentive for both of us to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. Looking forward to working this out!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering our different inflation rates, I think a 55-45 split in my favor is more equitable in the long run. This way, we both get a fair value over time. Let's reach an agreement soon to minimize the impact of inflation! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 4800, 
""bob_gain"": 5200, 
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm suggesting a more balanced 48-52 split in your favor. This still acknowledges the different inflation rates while being more equitable. We both lose if we keep negotiating too long, so let's find a middle ground soon.""}"
