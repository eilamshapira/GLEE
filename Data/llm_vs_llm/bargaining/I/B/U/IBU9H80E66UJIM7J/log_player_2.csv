"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 50-50 split which seems fair to start. Since my inflation rate (10%) is higher than yours (5%), there's incentive for both of us to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. Looking forward to working this out! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

# Bob's message: Hi Alice, while I appreciate your fair offer, I think it's important to consider our different inflation rates. I'd like to propose a 55-45 split in my favor to account for the difference in our inflation rates. This way, we both get a fair value over time. What do you think?"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering our different inflation rates, I think a 55-45 split in my favor is more equitable in the long run. This way, we both get a fair value over time. Let's reach an agreement soon to minimize the impact of inflation!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm suggesting a more balanced 48-52 split in your favor. This still acknowledges the different inflation rates while being more equitable. We both lose if we keep negotiating too long, so let's find a middle ground soon. 
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800
