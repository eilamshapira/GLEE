"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose to take $6000 for myself and give you $4000. This makes sure we both get a fair deal without losing too much value through inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, let's split things a bit more evenly this time. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's get closer to an even split. I'll take $5500 and you get $4500. This way, we both benefit while avoiding further value loss from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

I'm still holding out for a slightly better deal. While Alice's offer is closer to even, I think I can get her to agree to a 52.5/47.5 split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5250, ""alice_gain"": 4750, ""message"": ""Alice, time is ticking and we're both losing out.  Let's settle this fairly - I propose a 52.5/47.5 split. It's a good compromise, don't you think?""}"
