Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  It's a good starting point, and we can adjust later if you think it's not equitable.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it equally. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage. Remember, the money is worth less for me each round, so let's settle this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
