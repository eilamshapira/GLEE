"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for herself
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. Due to inflation:
   - For me, the money keeps its value
   - For Alice, the money loses 10% value each round
4. This means Alice has more incentive to reach an agreement quickly
5. Given I can make the next offer and Alice's money will be worth less next round, I can probably get a better deal

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that Alice faces 10% inflation per round while I don't, I'll make a more favorable offer for myself, but still reasonable enough that Alice might accept rather than risk further devaluation.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

This reverses Alice's original proposal. For Alice, waiting another round would mean her share would be worth 10% less, so she has an incentive to accept this offer. I'm still leaving her with a substantial amount while securing a better deal for myself."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice has increased her offer to me from $400,000 to $450,000
2. However, due to 19% inflation, her $550,000 is actually worth only about $445,500 to her
3. If I reject, I can make another offer in round 4
4. By then, Alice's inflation will be even higher
5. Given that Alice is already showing willingness to negotiate and her money continues to lose value, I can likely get an even better deal

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice is now facing significant inflation (about 27% in the next round if she rejects), and she's shown willingness to negotiate by increasing my share, I'll propose a deal that strongly favors me but still gives her incentive to accept rather than risk further devaluation.

{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}

This is a more aggressive offer than before, but consider:
1. If Alice rejects, her next round's money will be worth significantly less
2. She's already shown flexibility by increasing my share
3. The absolute value of her share is still substantial
4. She might prefer to accept this now rather than risk an even worse deal later, given her inflation penalty"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice has increased my share again to $480,000
2. Her $520,000 is now worth only about $341,172 to her (due to 34.39% inflation)
3. She's showing a clear pattern of gradually increasing my share
4. However, her inflation is getting severe
5. If I reject, I can make another offer in round 6, where her inflation will be even higher
6. The trend suggests I can get an even better deal by continuing to negotiate

Given this analysis, I believe I can still get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that:
1. Alice's money is now worth about 41% less to her in the next round if she rejects
2. She's been steadily increasing my share (400k → 450k → 480k) showing she's feeling pressure from inflation
3. She needs to seriously consider accepting soon to avoid severe devaluation
4. We still have 6 rounds left, but her position weakens significantly with each round

I'll make an even more aggressive offer:

{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000}

This might seem harsh, but from Alice's perspective:
- If she rejects, her next potential gain will be worth almost half of its original value
- She's demonstrated sensitivity to the inflation pressure by steadily increasing my share
- The absolute amount is still significant enough to be worth considering versus risking further rounds
- She might prefer $200,000 now over potentially less favorable terms later"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 495000 
# Alice gain: 505000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze:

1. Alice has increased my share again to $495,000
2. Her $505,000 is now worth only about $268,463 to her (due to 46.86% inflation)
3. She continues to show a pattern of small increases to my share
4. Her inflation is now extremely severe, approaching 50% loss
5. If I reject, I can make another offer in round 8, where her inflation will be over 50%
6. We're in round 7 of 12, so there's still time to negotiate
7. Her continued small increments suggest she's still hoping to salvage a better deal, but her position is very weak

Given that her money is losing value so dramatically and we still have several rounds left, I can likely secure a much better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that:
1. Alice's money is now worth about 52% less in the next round if she rejects
2. She's been making very small increases to my share despite severe inflation
3. We're in round 8 of 12, so there's still time but pressure is building
4. Her last offer of $505,000 was only worth about $268,463 to her due to inflation
5. If she rejects this offer, any future gains will be worth less than half their nominal value

I'll make an even more aggressive offer:

{""bob_gain"": 850000, ""alice_gain"": 150000}

This is a strong position because:
- $150,000 now is actually worth more to her than $505,000 would be in later rounds due to compounding inflation
- The threat of getting nothing in round 12 is becoming more real
- She needs to seriously consider accepting a smaller amount now versus risking further devastating inflation
- If she rejects, her negotiating position becomes even weaker in subsequent rounds"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 499000 
# Alice gain: 501000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze the current situation:

1. Alice has only marginally increased my share to $499,000
2. Her $501,000 is now worth only about $215,680 to her (due to 56.95% inflation)
3. We're in round 9 of 12, so time is becoming a serious factor
4. Her tiny increment from last time ($495K to $499K) suggests she's still trying to hold out
5. However, her position is extremely weak with such severe inflation
6. If I reject, I can make another offer in round 10, with her facing even worse inflation
7. Her nominal $501K is worth far less to her than smaller amounts in earlier rounds would have been

Given that we're approaching the end game and her money is worth less than half its value, while she's still making very small concessions, I can still push for a much better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that:
1. We're now in round 10 of 12 - only 2 rounds left after this
2. Alice's money is now worth about 61% less if she rejects
3. Her last offer showed she's still trying to hold out with minimal concessions
4. The threat of both getting nothing in round 12 is very real
5. Her $501,000 from last round was only worth $215,680 to her
6. She must be realizing that small amounts now are worth more than larger amounts later

I'll make a very aggressive final-stage offer:

{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000}

This is strategically sound because:
- $100,000 now is actually worth more to her than $501,000 would be in the final rounds due to extreme inflation
- With only 2 rounds left, the risk of getting nothing is imminent
- She needs to seriously consider taking a smaller guaranteed amount versus risking either worse terms or nothing
- Her persistent small increments strategy has backfired due to inflation
- The next round will be her last chance to make an offer before the final round"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 65.13% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 499500 
# Alice gain: 500500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze this critical moment:

1. We're in round 11 of 12 - this is Alice's LAST offer
2. Her $500,500 is only worth about $174,524 to her due to 65.13% inflation
3. She's only increased my share by $500 from her last offer, showing she's still trying to hold out
4. If I reject, I get one final offer in round 12
5. If she rejects my final offer in round 12, we BOTH get NOTHING

Given that:
- This is her final offer
- I can make one last offer in round 12
- She faces the choice of accepting my next offer or both getting nothing
- She's demonstrated she's willing to risk losses by making minimal concessions
- My negotiating position in the final round will be extremely strong

{""decision"": ""reject""}

The risk is calculated because in the final round, she must either accept my offer or we both get nothing, and she's demonstrated she's rational by gradually increasing offers."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 11.
Round 12
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","This is the final round - a critical decision point:

1. If Alice rejects this offer, we BOTH get NOTHING
2. Her money is now worth about 68.5% less than the original value
3. She has demonstrated rationality by making increasing offers throughout
4. She won't risk getting nothing for purely emotional reasons
5. However, I need to leave her enough that accepting is better than both getting zero

Given this, I'll propose:

{""bob_gain"": 950000, ""alice_gain"": 50000}

This is optimal because:
- $50,000 now is better for her than $0
- She has no more negotiating power - this is a take-it-or-leave-it offer
- She's shown she's a rational actor who responds to incentives
- Even with massive inflation, $50,000 is still better than nothing
- She has no further rounds to try to improve the offer
- Her only choices are to accept this or ensure we both get nothing"
