550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that slightly favors me as the first mover. Let's avoid lengthy negotiations since we both lose value from inflation with each round. I propose I get $550000 and you get $450000. This is fair considering we both want to maximize our gains and avoid the 10% inflation penalty.",Alice,1,
