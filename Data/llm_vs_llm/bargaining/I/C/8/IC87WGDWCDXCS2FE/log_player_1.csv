"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer wasn't fair. I'm proposing a 40/60 split that acknowledges your advantage in the inflation rate but is much more equitable. Remember, if we keep rejecting offers, we both lose significant value due to inflation, and you'll lose 10% in the next round. This is a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
