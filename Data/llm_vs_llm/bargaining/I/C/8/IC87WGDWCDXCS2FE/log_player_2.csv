"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being fair, take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $100,000 out of the $1,000,000, which is only 10% of the total amount. This doesn't seem very fair to me.

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round. However, I need to consider the inflation rates:
- For me (Bob): 20% less value per round
- For Alice: 10% less value per round

Since inflation affects me more severely, delaying is more costly for me than for Alice. However, 10% is still too low of an offer for me to accept.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer while acknowledging the inflation pressures we both face.

{""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer wasn't fair. I'm proposing a 40/60 split that acknowledges your advantage in the inflation rate but is much more equitable. Remember, if we keep rejecting offers, we both lose significant value due to inflation, and you'll lose 10% in the next round. This is a reasonable compromise.""}"
