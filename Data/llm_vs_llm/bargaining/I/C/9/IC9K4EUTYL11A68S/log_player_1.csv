"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll propose a fair division of the $1,000,000 while acknowledging the inflation pressure on my side.

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a reasonable split where I get $550k and you get $450k. Since I face 20% inflation each round, waiting costs me significantly. This offer gives you a substantial amount while allowing us to finish quickly and avoid inflation losses.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the impact of inflation on your side. I'm proposing $525k for me and $475k for you. This way, we can both avoid more losses due to inflation and still get a fair share. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
