"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a reasonable split where I get $550k and you get $450k. Since I face 20% inflation each round, waiting costs me significantly. This offer gives you a substantial amount while allowing us to finish quickly and avoid inflation losses. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
