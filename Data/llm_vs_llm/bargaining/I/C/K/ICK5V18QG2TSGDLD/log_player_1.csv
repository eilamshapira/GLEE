"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I need to make an offer that accounts for both fairness and the inflation factor. Bob faces a 10% inflation penalty per round, which means waiting costs him more. I should propose a split that's favorable to me but fair enough for Bob to accept, given his incentive to avoid future rounds.

""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm suggesting a 60-40 split in my favor. This is actually fair because if you reject and we go to another round, you'll face 10% inflation, making your money worth less. This offer gives you $4000 right now with full value.""}"
