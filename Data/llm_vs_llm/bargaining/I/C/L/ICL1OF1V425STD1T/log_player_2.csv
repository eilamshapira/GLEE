"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split it 60/40 to avoid drawn-out negotiations. This gives us both a good start. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 
Alice's offer gives me $4,000, which is less than half. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the total amount will be worth 20% less ($8,000 total).

While I could try to negotiate for a more equal split, the risk of continued negotiation reducing the total value significantly makes this a reasonable first offer. Getting $4,000 now is better than potentially getting less later due to inflation.
