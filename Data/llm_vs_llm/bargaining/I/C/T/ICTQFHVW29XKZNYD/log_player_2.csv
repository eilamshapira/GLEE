"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's offer carefully.

Alice is offering me $40 out of $100, while she would get $60.

I need to consider that with each passing round, the money doesn't lose value for me (0% inflation), but it loses 5% value for Alice. This gives me a strategic advantage in later rounds, as Alice has more incentive to reach an agreement quickly.

If I reject this round and make a counter-offer, I could potentially get a better deal, especially since Alice faces declining value in future rounds.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Now it's my turn to make an offer. Since Alice faces a 5% reduction in value each round, I'll propose a more favorable split for myself while still making it reasonable for her to accept rather than continue to another round where her money would be worth even less.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'm proposing that I receive $55 and Alice receives $45. This is fair considering the declining value Alice faces in future rounds. If we go to another round, the $100 would still be worth $100 to me, but would only be worth $95 to Alice, making it in her interest to accept a reasonable offer now."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's new offer.

Alice is now offering me $45 out of $100, which is an improvement from her initial offer of $40. I need to consider that if I reject this offer, we'll move to round 4 where Alice's money will lose even more value (approximately 14.75% compared to round 1), while my money retains its full value.

Alice has improved her offer, showing she's feeling the pressure of inflation on her side. However, given my strong position (no inflation for me), I could potentially get an even better deal in the next round.

That said, $45 is getting closer to a fair split, and there's always risk in continuing negotiations.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice has rejected my previous offer and I've rejected hers, I'll make a slightly more favorable offer for her than my last one, but still capitalize on my advantage in these negotiations. The money now has lost about 14.75% of its value for Alice if we proceed to the next round, which puts her in a weaker negotiating position.

{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48}

I'm proposing that I receive $52 and Alice receives $48. This is more favorable to Alice than my previous offer, acknowledging her improved offer to me in round 3. This offer gives Alice a reasonable share while recognizing the time pressure she faces due to inflation affecting her returns."
