"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, the money is now worth 20% less to me, so the total amount I'm considering is $100 * 0.8 = $80. I'll make an offer that gives me a bit more than half of this reduced amount.

{""bob_gain"": 45, 
""alice_gain"": 55}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Alice's offer, I'll get $45, but its value to me is reduced by 36% due to inflation, so I'll effectively get $45 * 0.64 = $28.80.

If I reject this offer, the money will be worth even less to me in the next round. Given that Alice's offer gives me $45, which is a significant portion of the original $100, and considering the reduced value of the money to me, I think it's a relatively fair offer.
