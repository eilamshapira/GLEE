I propose to keep $6000 and give Bob $4000.  I figure this is a fair starting point, as I'm taking a slightly larger share.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5250 
# Bob gain: 4750 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
