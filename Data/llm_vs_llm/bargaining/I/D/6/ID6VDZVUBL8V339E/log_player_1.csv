"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 235712.81, ""bob_gain"": 764287.19, ""message"": ""Hi Bob – let’s agree now rather than lose value later. Considering that with each round the pot shrinks by 5%, waiting hurts us both. Based on a backward‐induction analysis of our 12‑round game, if you reject this offer you can expect, as proposer in Round 2, to secure about $764,287.19 for yourself while I get the rest. Thus, I’m offering you exactly that: $764,287.19 for you and $235,712.81 for me. Let’s lock this in now to maximize our real gains. What do you say?""}"
