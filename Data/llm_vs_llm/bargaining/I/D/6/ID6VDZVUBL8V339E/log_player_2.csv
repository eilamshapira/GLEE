"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob – let’s agree now rather than lose value later. Considering that with each round the pot shrinks by 5%, waiting hurts us both. Based on a backward‐induction analysis of our 12‑round game, if you reject this offer you can expect, as proposer in Round 2, to secure about $764287.19 for yourself while I get the rest. Thus, I’m offering you exactly that: $764287.19 for you and $235712.81 for me. Let’s lock this in now to maximize our real gains. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 764287.19 
# Alice gain: 235712.81 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether to accept Alice's offer, let's analyze the situation.

If I accept, I get $764,287.19, and if I reject, according to Alice's analysis, I would get approximately $764,287.19 in the next round as well. However, we need to consider the effect of inflation.

In the first round, the total amount is $1,000,000. If I reject the offer and we move to the second round, the total amount will decrease by 5% due to inflation, making it $950,000.

As Alice mentioned, if I were to propose in the second round, I could potentially get $764,287.19, but this amount would be based on the reduced total of $950,000, not the original $1,000,000. 

However, Alice's offer in the first round already takes into account the backward induction and the potential loss due to inflation in subsequent rounds. Given that her offer matches what I could potentially get in the next round, and considering that waiting will indeed reduce the total amount due to inflation, it seems reasonable to accept her offer to maximize my real gain.
