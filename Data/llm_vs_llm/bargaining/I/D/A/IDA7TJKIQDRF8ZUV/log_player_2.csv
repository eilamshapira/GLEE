"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer gives me $4,000 and Alice $6,000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-proposal next round
3. However, due to 20% inflation for me, in the next round the money will be worth less
4. $4,000 now is better than $5,000 in the next round (which would be worth $4,000 after 20% inflation)
5. Alice has less inflation pressure (5%), so she has more negotiating power
6. Getting 40% of the pot isn't terrible given these conditions

While I could try to negotiate for more, the inflation penalty makes it risky. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush.
