500.0,9500.0,"Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $500 and you receive $9500. By accepting now, you secure the full value—whereas if we delay to round 2, you’d face a 5% depreciation (and I’d suffer 10% depreciation) and can almost claim the entire pie for yourself. This offer ensures you get nearly what you’d expect by waiting, and it spares us both the inflation penalty. Let’s agree now!",Alice,1,
