"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since I face 5% inflation each round and you don't, I need a larger share to make it fair. 60/40 in my favor is reasonable to compensate for my time disadvantage. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering Bob's argument about the inflation affecting his share, I'll think carefully about this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40 in his favor, I'll try to find a middle ground. Also, considering the inflation affecting Bob's share, I'll make a slightly more generous offer.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 55/45 is a fair compromise""}"
