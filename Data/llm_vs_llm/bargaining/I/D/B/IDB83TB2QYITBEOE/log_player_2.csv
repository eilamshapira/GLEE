"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40, a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me $400,000, while taking $600,000 for herself. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but the money will be worth 5% less to me then. So my $400,000 now is worth more than $400,000 in the next round.

However, I think I can get a better deal. A 60/40 split in Alice's favor when she has no inflation penalty seems a bit unfair. Since I'm facing inflation pressure, I should try to negotiate for a larger share early.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that I face 5% inflation per round while Alice doesn't, I should propose a more favorable split for myself to compensate for this disadvantage. I'll propose a 60/40 split in my favor, which is reasonable considering my time pressure.

{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Since I face 5% inflation each round and you don't, I need a larger share to make it fair. 60/40 in my favor is reasonable to compensate for my time disadvantage.""
}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle, 55/45 is a fair compromise 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice is offering me $450,000, which due to 9.75% inflation is actually worth $406,125 to me
2. This is better than her first offer
3. If I reject, in the next round I'll face 14.25% inflation
4. Alice seems willing to negotiate and has moved significantly from her first position
5. The 55/45 split acknowledges my inflation disadvantage somewhat
6. Given the inflation penalty increases each round, continuing to negotiate might reduce my actual gains

While I might want a bit more, the inflation risk makes this a reasonable offer. The trend of negotiations is positive, but the cost of delay is significant for me.
