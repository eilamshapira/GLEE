6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, let's start with a fair offer. I propose 60/40 split, seems reasonable given we're just starting and inflation will hurt us both if we delay.",Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, considering the inflation, I think a 55/45 split in my favor is fair. This way, we both get a good share before the money loses more value.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, I understand your concern about inflation, but 55/45 is too steep this early. How about we meet in the middle at 52/48, me taking the slightly larger share to account for my greater inflation impact? This seems like a fair compromise to avoid losing more value.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4600.0,5400.0,"Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but given the inflation, I think a 54/46 split in my favor is more balanced. This way, we both get a fair share while considering the decreasing value of the money.",Bob,4,

5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, Let's just split it 50/50. We're losing value with each passing round. A fair, simple split will ensure we both walk away with something before it's too late.",Alice,5,
