"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we settle now. Given our differing discount rates, this split reflects the equilibrium: I take $208333 and you get $791667. Accepting today avoids further losses for both of us due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 791667 
# Alice gain: 208333 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Current split: $791,667 for me (Bob) and $208,333 for Alice
2. If I reject:
   * The money will be worth 5% less for me next round
   * The money will be worth 20% less for Alice next round
   * I'll get to make the next proposal

Alice's logic about different discount rates is sound. Because her discount rate (20%) is much higher than mine (5%), she has more incentive to settle quickly, giving me more bargaining power.

The offered amount of $791,667 is quite favorable for me, representing about 79% of the total. If I reject and the game continues, the total value decreases for both of us, and there's no guarantee I'll get a significantly better deal.

Given the favorable split and the risk of value depreciation, I should accept this offer.
