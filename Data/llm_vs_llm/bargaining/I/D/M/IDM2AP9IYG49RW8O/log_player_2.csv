"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer carefully.

Alice is proposing I get $40 while she gets $60. If I reject this offer, I'll be able to make a counter-offer in the next round, but the total value will decrease by 10% for me and 20% for Alice.

If we move to round 2:
- The $100 would be worth $90 to me
- The $100 would be worth $80 to Alice

This means I could potentially propose a more favorable split for myself, knowing that Alice has a stronger incentive to accept due to her higher depreciation rate.

Given these considerations, I think I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer that takes into account our different inflation rates. Since Alice faces a higher depreciation rate (20% vs my 10%), she should be more motivated to reach an agreement now rather than later. I'll propose a more balanced split that's still favorable to me.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'm proposing that I receive $55 and Alice receives $45. This is a fair offer considering that if Alice rejects and we move to round 3, the money will be worth even less to her (only 80% of the original value for her, versus 90% for me). This gives her an incentive to accept now rather than continuing negotiations where we both lose value, but she loses more."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this updated situation.

We're now in round 3, and the inflation has reduced the value of money for both of us:
- For me, money is worth 19% less than in round 1
- For Alice, money is worth 36% less than in round 1

Alice is now offering me $45 and taking $55 for herself. If I reject this:
1. We'll move to round 4
2. Inflation will continue to reduce the value for both of us
3. I'll get to make the next offer, but with less valuable money

Let me calculate the actual value of Alice's current offer to me:
$45 with 19% depreciation means this is actually worth $45 Ã— 0.81 = $36.45 in round 1 terms.

If I reject and we go to round 4, I'd face additional depreciation, and there's no guarantee Alice would accept my next offer.

Considering the diminishing returns from continuing and the reasonable offer Alice has made, I'll accept this offer.
