"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a division offer that takes into account our different inflation rates.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500}

Bob, I'm proposing you get $4,500 while I take $5,500. Since your money devalues faster (20% vs my 10% per round), it's in your interest to accept this offer now rather than waiting for future rounds when your share would be worth less."
