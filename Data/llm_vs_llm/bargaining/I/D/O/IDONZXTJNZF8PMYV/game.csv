600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. If you reject, the next round will make the money worth 10% less to you, so this is a fair offer.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
505000.0,495000.0,"Alice, the money is worth 10% less to me now. I propose a near-even split, considering my loss. Take it or leave it.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, due to the 20% total inflation on your side, this 65-35 split is actually fair. Your $350000 is worth $280000 to you now, while if you reject and we go to another round, it will be worth even less. This is a reasonable offer considering the circumstances.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
560000.0,440000.0,"Alice, the money is worth significantly less to me now. I propose a split where I get almost half. This is the fairest I can offer considering the inflation and previous offers. Take it, or you risk getting nothing.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
700000.0,300000.0,"Bob, let's be practical. Due to the accumulated inflation (over 30%), your $300000 is worth about $200000 to you now. If you reject again, your next round's value will decrease even further. This is still a better deal for you than continuing the negotiation. Let's end this now.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
620000.0,380000.0,"Alice, this is the last offer. I'm offering slightly better terms. This is the last round where you'll get a decent sum. Consider it carefully, because I'm not offering you more than this in the next round.",Bob,6,
