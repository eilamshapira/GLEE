"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. If you reject, the next round will make the money worth 10% less to you, so this is a fair offer.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the money is worth 10% less to me now. I propose a near-even split, considering my loss. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 505000 
# Bob gain: 495000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Bob's $495,000 is actually worth only $445,500 to him (90% of original value) due to inflation
2. My $505,000 maintains its full value
3. If I reject, in the next round:
   - I can make a new offer
   - But Bob's value will decrease another 10%
   - Which gives me more negotiating leverage

Since I can likely get a better deal in the next round when Bob's position is weaker, and since my original proposal was for $600,000:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 650000, 
""bob_gain"": 350000, 
""message"": ""Bob, due to the 20% total inflation on your side, this 65-35 split is actually fair. Your $350,000 is worth $280,000 to you now, while if you reject and we go to another round, it will be worth even less. This is a reasonable offer considering the circumstances.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the money is worth significantly less to me now. I propose a split where I get almost half. This is the fairest I can offer considering the inflation and previous offers. Take it, or you risk getting nothing. 
# Alice gain: 560000 
# Bob gain: 440000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Bob's $440,000 is actually worth only $320,760 to him (72.9% of original value) due to inflation
2. My $560,000 maintains its full value
3. If I reject:
   - I can make a new offer next round
   - Bob's value will decrease another 10%
   - My negotiating position gets even stronger
4. The offer is still below my original ask of $600,000

Since the amount offered is still significantly below what I originally proposed, and my negotiating position will be even stronger next round:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 700000, 
""bob_gain"": 300000, 
""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical. Due to the accumulated inflation (over 30%), your $300,000 is worth about $200,000 to you now. If you reject again, your next round's value will decrease even further. This is still a better deal for you than continuing the negotiation. Let's end this now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is the last offer. I'm offering slightly better terms. This is the last round where you'll get a decent sum. Consider it carefully, because I'm not offering you more than this in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 620000 
# Bob gain: 380000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Bob's $380,000 is now worth only $224,390 to him (59.05% of original value) due to inflation
2. My $620,000 maintains its full value
3. If I reject:
   - I can make another offer next round
   - Bob's value will decrease another 10%
   - However, Bob's message suggests he might make an even lower offer next time

This offer ($620,000) is actually better than my initial proposal ($600,000), and while I could potentially get more by continuing to negotiate, there's also a risk of Bob making good on his threat to offer less in future rounds. The current offer represents a good compromise and is close to my desired outcome.
