"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. If you reject, the next round will make the money worth 10% less to you, so this is a fair offer.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, due to the 20% total inflation on your side, this 65-35 split is actually fair. Your $350000 is worth $280000 to you now, while if you reject and we go to another round, it will be worth even less. This is a reasonable offer considering the circumstances.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical. Due to the accumulated inflation (over 30%), your $300000 is worth about $200000 to you now. If you reject again, your next round's value will decrease even further. This is still a better deal for you than continuing the negotiation. Let's end this now.
