Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split the $100 as $55 for me and $45 for you. Settling now avoids the risk of further devaluation on my end, and I believe this is a fair start. Let me know if you agree!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I believe a 50-50 split is fairer, especially considering the potential devaluation. Let's settle on this to ensure we both get an equal share before the value drops further. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
