"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the $100 as $55 for me and $45 for you. Settling now avoids the risk of further devaluation on my end, and I believe this is a fair start. Let me know if you agree! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
