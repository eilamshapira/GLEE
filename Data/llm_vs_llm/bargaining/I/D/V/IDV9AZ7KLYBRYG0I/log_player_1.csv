"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40} 
```

My reasoning for this offer:

* **Time pressure:**  Bob's share is decreasing rapidly due to the 20% inflation. This puts pressure on him to accept a deal sooner rather than later.
* **My decreasing value:** While my share is also decreasing, it's at a slower rate. It's still in my best interest to secure a deal rather than let too many rounds pass.
* **Fairness:**  This offer is a more ""fair"" split than Bob's previous offer, acknowledging that we're both losing value over time. 

I believe this offer has a good chance of being accepted, as it benefits Bob to take a reasonable deal now before his potential gains diminish further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

While a 50/50 split wasn't ideal in earlier rounds, Bob's share is now decreasing significantly faster than mine. Accepting this offer allows me to cut my losses and still secure a reasonable amount of the initial $100."
