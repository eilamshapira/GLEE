"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I propose a fair split where I get slightly more to account for my inflation risk. If you reject, we'll both lose value due to inflation, so this is a win-win offer.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concern about inflation, but I also need to consider my own risks. This offer gives you a bit more than an even split, accounting for your previous request. Let's settle this round to minimize further value loss. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
