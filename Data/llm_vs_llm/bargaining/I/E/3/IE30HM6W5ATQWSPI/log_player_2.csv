Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's go with a perfectly even split. We're both losing value with each round due to inflation, so it's in our mutual interest to reach an agreement now. This 50-50 split is fair for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
