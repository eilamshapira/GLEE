"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I need to factor in the decreasing value of the money for both of us with each round. This first round, I'm Alice and I'm making the proposal.

Here's my offer, taking into account the incentive to avoid future rounds:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   I'm asking for a slightly larger share because I'm making the initial offer and want to make it attractive enough for Bob to accept immediately.
*   I'm also trying to be reasonable, as a very greedy offer might lead to rejection and a worse outcome for me in later rounds due to inflation."
