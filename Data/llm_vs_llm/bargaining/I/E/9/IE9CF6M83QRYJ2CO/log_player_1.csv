"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair but slightly advantageous split for myself since I'm moving first.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because it's close enough to 50-50 to be considered fair, but gives me a slight advantage as the first mover. If Bob rejects, the money will be worth 20% less to me in the next round, so this offer should be attractive enough for Bob to accept while still being beneficial for me."
