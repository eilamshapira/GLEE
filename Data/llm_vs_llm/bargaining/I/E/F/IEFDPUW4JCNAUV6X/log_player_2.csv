"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's split it 60/40. This is a fair offer, and we both walk away with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I think a 55/45 split is more reflective of a fair deal. Let's close this and avoid further inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, how about we meet in the middle? 55 for me, 45 for you. Considering the inflation, this is a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
