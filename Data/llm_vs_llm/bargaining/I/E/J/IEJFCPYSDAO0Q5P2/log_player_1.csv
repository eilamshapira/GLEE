"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Round 1

I need to make a compelling first offer to Bob, considering the inflation rates of 20% for me and 10% for Bob in each passing round. Since I lose more value per round than Bob, I should aim to reach an agreement quickly.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split, dividing the money equally between us at $500,000 each. This is a fair starting point that respects both our interests and gives us both significant value right away, avoiding any inflation penalties."
