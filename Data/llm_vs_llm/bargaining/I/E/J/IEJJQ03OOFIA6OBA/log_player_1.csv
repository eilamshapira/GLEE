"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $600,000 and giving Bob $400,000, with a message suggesting that this is a fair starting point. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it equally to ensure fairness for both of us! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, the $500,000 I would receive is actually worth $500,000 * 0.9 = $450,000 to me.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is not bad, as it gives me a significant amount of money. However, I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the next round.

My response is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round. Let's see what happens!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Due to inflation, the money I gain is now worth 10% less than in Round 2, which means it's worth 20% less than in Round 1 (10% in Round 1 + 10% in Round 2). So, the money I gain is now worth 0.8 times its original value.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust the split to 55/45""
}
```

I'm offering to take $550,000 and giving Bob $450,000, with a message explaining that I'm adjusting the split to account for inflation. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation impacts on both sides, let's adjust to 55/45 in my favor this round! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 27.1% less due to inflation, the $450,000 I would receive is actually worth $450,000 * (1 - 0.271) = $450,000 * 0.729 = $328,050 to me.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is not very favorable to me, as it gives me a relatively small amount of money compared to what I could have gotten in earlier rounds. However, I also need to consider that the money is losing value quickly, and I don't know how much longer I can afford to wait.

My response is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer, as I don't want to risk losing even more value due to inflation. It's better to get $328,050 worth of value now than to potentially get even less in a future round."
