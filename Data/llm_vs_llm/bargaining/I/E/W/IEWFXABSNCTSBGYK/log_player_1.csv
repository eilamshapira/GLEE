Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's go for a 50-50 split. Fair for both of us! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. If I accept Bob's 50-50 offer now:
   * My $50 is worth 20% less due to inflation = $40 real value
   * This is less than what I could have gotten in round 1 ($60)

2. If I reject and make another offer in round 3:
   * The money will be worth even less (40% less than original)
   * A $60 share would only be worth $36 in real value

Since $40 (current offer's real value) is better than what I could reasonably expect to get in future rounds due to increasing inflation, I should accept.
