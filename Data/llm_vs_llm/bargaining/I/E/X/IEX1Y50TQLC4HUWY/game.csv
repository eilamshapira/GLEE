,,,Bob,1,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"Alice, the clock is ticking and your share loses 5% each round. Accept 300K now—it's a strong offer that beats the further depreciation you'll incur. Let's settle this amicably in round 2.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
570000.0,430000.0,"Still willing to compromise, 57-43 is a fair deal considering my losses",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
110000.0,890000.0,"Alice, time is against you—each extra round further devalues your share. If you reject today, your future proposal in round 5 will force you to cede nearly all the pie to me, given my advantage with no inflation loss. This offer gives you $110K nominal (worth about $94K now), which is more than the best you can expect if you delay. Let's settle this round and close the deal.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Not giving up yet, 55-45 is still reasonable considering my total loss so far",Alice,5,
,,"Alice, I see your willingness to compromise, but waiting to propose my own division in round 6 gives me a significant advantage. I stand to secure a better outcome given the inflation hit you face, so I prefer to move the negotiation forward.",Bob,5,reject
581300.0,418700.0,"Alice, every round you wait further reduces the real value of your share—by round 7 your money will be worth only about 73.5% of its nominal value. Accepting my offer in round 6 gets you 581300 nominal dollars, which translates to roughly 450000 in real value. This is at least as good as (and likely better than) what you can secure in round 7. Let's settle now before the devaluation hurts you further.",Bob,6,
