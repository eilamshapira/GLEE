Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the clock is ticking and your share loses 5% each round. Accept 300K now—it's a strong offer that beats the further depreciation you'll incur. Let's settle this amicably in round 2. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, time is against you—each extra round further devalues your share. If you reject today, your future proposal in round 5 will force you to cede nearly all the pie to me, given my advantage with no inflation loss. This offer gives you $110K nominal (worth about $94K now), which is more than the best you can expect if you delay. Let's settle this round and close the deal. 
# Alice gain: 110000 
# Bob gain: 890000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every round you wait further reduces the real value of your share—by round 7 your money will be worth only about 73.5% of its nominal value. Accepting my offer in round 6 gets you 581300 nominal dollars, which translates to roughly 450000 in real value. This is at least as good as (and likely better than) what you can secure in round 7. Let's settle now before the devaluation hurts you further. 
# Alice gain: 581300 
# Bob gain: 418700
