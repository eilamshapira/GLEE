Accept 300K now—it's a strong offer that beats the further depreciation you'll incur. Let's settle this amicably in round 2.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 890000, ""alice_gain"": 110000, ""message"": ""Alice, time is against you—each extra round further devalues your share. If you reject today, your future proposal in round 5 will force you to cede nearly all the pie to me, given my advantage with no inflation loss. This offer gives you $110K nominal (worth about $94K now), which is more than the best you can expect if you delay. Let's settle this round and close the deal.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5

# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Alice, I see your willingness to compromise, but waiting to propose my own division in round 6 gives me a significant advantage. I stand to secure a better outcome given the inflation hit you face, so I prefer to move the negotiation forward.""}"

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 418700, ""alice_gain"": 581300, ""message"": ""Alice, every round you wait further reduces the real value of your share—by round 7 your money will be worth only about 73.5% of its nominal value. Accepting my offer in round 6 gets you 581,300 nominal dollars, which translates to roughly 450,000 in real value. This is at least as good as (and likely better than) what you can secure in round 7. Let's settle now before the devaluation hurts you further.""}"
