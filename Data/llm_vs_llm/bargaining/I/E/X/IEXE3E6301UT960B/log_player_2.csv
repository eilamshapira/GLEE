"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing I get $400,000 and she gets $600,000 of the $1,000,000.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, I'll face 5% inflation (my $400,000 would effectively become $380,000). Alice faces 20% inflation, so her $600,000 would effectively become $480,000.

This suggests I might have negotiating leverage in later rounds due to our different inflation rates. However, with only 12 rounds total and the risk of getting nothing if we can't agree, I should be strategic.

Given this is just the first round and I believe I can propose a more favorable split next round that Alice would still accept (considering her higher inflation penalty), I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a strategic offer that considers our different inflation rates. Since Alice faces a higher inflation rate (20% vs my 5%), she has more incentive to reach an agreement sooner. I'll propose a more favorable split for myself while still giving Alice enough to make accepting worthwhile.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering a split where I get $550,000 and Alice gets $450,000. This is more favorable to me than Alice's initial offer, but it still gives her a substantial portion that would be worth more to her now than waiting for future rounds where her share would be subject to higher inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's new offer.

Alice is now offering me $450,000, which is $50,000 more than her initial offer. Due to the 9.75% inflation, this $450,000 is actually worth about $406,125 in round 1 value.

If I reject and we continue to round 4, my inflation will grow to about 14.25% and Alice's to 48.8%. This increasing inflation pressure affects Alice much more severely than me.

However, I also need to be mindful that we only have 12 rounds total, and if we don't reach an agreement, we both get nothing.

Since Alice has moved significantly from her initial position (offering me an additional $50,000), and we're still early in the negotiation, I'll make one more attempt to reach a more favorable agreement.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given the increasing inflation pressure on both of us (especially Alice), and the fact that we need to reach agreement within 12 rounds, I'll make a more reasonable offer that still improves my position.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing an equal split of the $1,000,000. This is fair and gives us both the same nominal amount. It's better for me than Alice's last offer, and given Alice's higher inflation rate, she has a stronger incentive to accept soon rather than continuing to negotiate as her potential gains decrease more rapidly than mine."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer carefully.

Alice is now offering me $475,000, which is $25,000 more than her previous offer. With my current inflation rate of 18.55%, this $475,000 is worth about $386,888 in round 1 value.

The inflation rates are increasing significantly with each round. If we continue to round 6, my inflation will grow to around 22.6% and Alice's to about 67.2%. Alice's purchasing power is diminishing much faster than mine.

We're now in round 5 of 12, so we still have time, but we're approaching the midpoint of our negotiation window. Alice has been making incremental concessions ($400K → $450K → $475K for me), which shows willingness to compromise.

Given the significant inflation pressure on Alice and her pattern of increasing offers, I think I can get a bit more by continuing, but I also don't want to risk getting nothing if we exhaust all 12 rounds.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","As we enter round 6, the inflation pressure is building significantly, especially for Alice. I need to make an offer that's attractive enough for Alice to accept while still improving my position.

{""bob_gain"": 490000, ""alice_gain"": 510000}

I'm offering a split where I get $490,000 and Alice gets $510,000. This is very close to an even split, and it's only slightly less favorable to Alice than her last offer ($525,000 for her). Given that her money is depreciating at 20% per round versus my 5%, it makes financial sense for her to accept this now rather than risk further inflation in future rounds. We're now at the halfway point of our negotiation window, so it's becoming increasingly important for both of us to reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 485000 
# Alice gain: 515000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's latest offer.

Alice is now offering me $485,000, which is $10,000 more than her previous offer. With my current inflation rate of 26.49%, this $485,000 is worth about $356,524 in round 1 value.

The inflation effect is becoming very significant. Alice's inflation rate is now 73.79%, which means her purchasing power is severely diminished. We're now in round 7 of 12, so we've passed the halfway point.

Alice has continued her pattern of making incremental concessions ($400K → $450K → $475K → $485K for me). Her offers are getting closer to an even split, with her current offer being $485K/$515K.

Given that:
1. We're in round 7 of 12
2. Alice's money is rapidly losing value (much faster than mine)
3. Her current offer is close to 50/50
4. The risk of getting nothing increases with each round

I think this is a reasonable offer to accept at this point.
