"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000
}

Reasoning:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing, so holding out for a significantly larger share in later rounds is risky. 
* **Fairness:** While I want to maximize my gain, I need to offer Bob a deal that is appealing enough to accept. A 55/45 split is still favorable to me but closer to even than my previous offer. 
* **Uncertainty about Bob's inflation:** I don't know how inflation is affecting Bob. It's possible he's experiencing a smaller or larger rate, which could influence his decision-making."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Reasoning:

Even though this offer is slightly worse than Bob's previous offer, the impact of inflation is significant. If I reject this offer and Bob doesn't offer a better deal in the next round, I risk ending up with even less. It's better to accept a less favorable deal now than risk further devaluation of the money."
