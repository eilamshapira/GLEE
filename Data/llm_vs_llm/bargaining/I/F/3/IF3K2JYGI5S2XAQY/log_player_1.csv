"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, I need to consider the actual value I'll get. 
The value I'll get is 450000 * 0.9 = 405000.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is not in my favor.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less in each round, and this is the third round, I need to consider the actual value I'll get. 
The value I'll get is x * 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81x, where x is the amount I propose for myself.

The value Bob will get is y * 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025y, where y is the amount I propose for Bob.

I'll make an offer that takes this into account.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 27.1% less, I need to consider the actual value I'll get. 
The value I'll get is 420000 * 0.729 = 306180.

Considering this, I think I should evaluate if this offer is better than making a counteroffer and risking further inflation.
