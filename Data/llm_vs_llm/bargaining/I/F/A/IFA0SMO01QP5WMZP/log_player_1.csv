"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a reasonable offer that gives both of us a good share, considering that inflation will reduce the value in future rounds if Bob rejects it.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split because it's relatively fair while giving me a slight advantage as the first mover. It's better for Bob to accept this now than risk losing value to inflation in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. Since there's 5% inflation for me, $5000 is now worth $4750 in terms of round 1 value. This is less than what I offered Bob in round 1.

If I reject and make a new offer in round 3, the 10% cumulative inflation will make it even harder to get a good deal for myself. Also, Bob's showing willingness to do an equal split, which is generally considered fair.

Given these factors, I'll accept this offer now rather than risk further value loss from inflation.
