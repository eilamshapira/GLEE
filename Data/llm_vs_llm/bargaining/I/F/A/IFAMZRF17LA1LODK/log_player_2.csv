"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

I propose a 60-40 split in our favor. Given that inflation impacts me more severely (20% vs. your 5%), this adjustment helps balance the long-term value. This is a fair compromise that recognizes our different inflation rates while still giving you a substantial portion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
