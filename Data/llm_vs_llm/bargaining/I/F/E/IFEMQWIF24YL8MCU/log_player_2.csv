"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a counter-offer in the next round. This offer is extremely unfair, giving me only $1 out of $1,000,000. Even with 5% inflation risk, it's worth making a counter-proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is still a fair offer for Alice, as she would receive a substantial $400,000. I'm asking for a larger share because I know I face 5% inflation risk if she rejects this offer. This split gives us both significant gains while acknowledging the inflation risk I face."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make another counter-offer. Even with nearly 10% inflation, accepting just $1 out of $1,000,000 is still extremely unfair. The inflation penalty is significant but not severe enough to accept such an unfair division. I'll try to negotiate a more reasonable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}

I'm increasing my requested share to 70-30 to compensate for the increasing inflation risk I'm facing. Alice has shown she's willing to be aggressive in negotiations by repeatedly offering me just $1, so I need to maintain a strong position. Even with this split, Alice would still receive a substantial $300,000, which is far more reasonable than the extreme splits she has proposed. This offer balances my need to protect against inflation with maintaining a significant enough offer to Alice that she might accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Even with an 18.55% inflation penalty, accepting $1 out of $1,000,000 is still an extremely poor outcome. My $1 would be worth only about $0.81 due to inflation, while Alice continues to show she's not negotiating in good faith by repeatedly offering the minimum possible amount. I'll make another counter-offer, though I'll need to consider the increasing inflation risk carefully in my next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000}

I'm increasing my requested share to 80-20 for several reasons:
1. The inflation penalty is becoming severe (over 18% and will get worse)
2. Alice has demonstrated she's not negotiating in good faith by repeatedly offering $1
3. Even with this more aggressive split, Alice would still get $200,000, which is vastly better than the $1 she's offering me
4. If negotiations continue much longer, the inflation will significantly erode my gains

This offer aims to make it clear that I won't accept unfair proposals while still leaving Alice with a substantial sum that should be more attractive than continuing this pattern of rejected offers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Despite the severe inflation penalty of 26.49%, accepting $1 (which would be worth only about $0.74 after inflation) out of $1,000,000 is still an unacceptable outcome. Alice continues to show no willingness to make reasonable offers, but even with this high inflation, the potential upside of making a counter-offer outweighs accepting less than $1 in real value. I will make another offer, though I need to be very mindful of the rapidly increasing inflation penalty."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000}

I'm making a more aggressive offer for several reasons:
1. The inflation penalty has become severe (26.49% and climbing)
2. Alice has demonstrated complete unwillingness to negotiate fairly by offering $1 every time
3. Even with this 90-10 split, Alice would still get $100,000, which is astronomically better than the $1 she keeps offering me
4. If this continues much longer, the inflation will make any gains I might get significantly less valuable

This offer signals that I won't be pressured into accepting an unfair deal just because of inflation. A $100,000 offer to Alice is still very generous compared to her repeated $1 offers to me, and the mounting inflation pressure means we both should have incentive to reach an agreement soon."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Even with the severe 33.66% inflation penalty, accepting $1 (worth only about $0.66 after inflation) versus making a counter-offer is still not rational. While the inflation is becoming very concerning, Alice's continued $1 offers show she's trying to use the inflation pressure to force an extremely unfair outcome. The potential upside of another counter-offer still outweighs accepting less than $1 in real value. I will make one more attempt at a reasonable division, though the inflation situation is becoming critical."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 950000, ""alice_gain"": 50000}

I'm making this very aggressive 95-5 split because:
1. The inflation penalty has become extremely severe (33.66% and will get worse)
2. Alice has shown absolutely no willingness to negotiate fairly, offering $1 in every single round
3. Even with this split, Alice would still get $50,000, which is 50,000 times better than what she keeps offering me
4. The inflation is now so high that any further rounds will significantly diminish the value of any deal I might get

$50,000 to Alice is still a reasonable offer given:
- Her complete unwillingness to negotiate fairly
- The fact that she faces no inflation penalty
- The severe inflation penalty I'm facing on any future gains

This offer gives her a clear choice: take a still-significant sum or continue this pattern where both of us might end up worse off due to the mounting inflation effects on my side."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.13% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Even with a devastating 40.13% inflation penalty, accepting $1 (worth only about $0.60 after inflation) is still not rational. While the inflation has become extremely severe, Alice's continued $1 offers demonstrate she's trying to exploit the inflation pressure to force an extraordinarily unfair outcome. The potential upside of another counter-offer, even with such high inflation, still outweighs accepting less than $1 in real value. I will make another attempt, though we're reaching a critical point where inflation might soon force a different decision."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 11.
Round 12
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 999999, ""alice_gain"": 1}

I'm making this maximally aggressive offer because:
1. The inflation penalty is now catastrophic (over 40% and climbing)
2. Alice has demonstrated complete intransigence, offering me $1 in every single round
3. She is clearly playing a game of chicken, trying to use the inflation pressure to force me to accept an unfair deal
4. She has shown zero willingness to make even minimally reasonable offers

By offering her $1, I am:
- Matching her level of ""cooperation""
- Demonstrating that I understand this has become a pure game of chicken
- Showing that I'm willing to continue despite the severe inflation penalty

This offer sends a clear message: I am willing to continue this game even with catastrophic inflation rather than accept an unfair deal. While this might seem extreme, Alice's behavior has shown that conventional reasonable offers are ineffective. She needs to understand that I'm willing to risk significant value loss through inflation rather than be coerced into accepting her unfair terms."
