"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose an equal split of $5000 each. This is fair for both of us, and we can resolve this quickly without losing value to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which might seem fair at first glance. However, I know that with each passing round, my share will be worth 20% less due to inflation. While I don't know how inflation affects Alice, I know it affects me significantly.

If I reject and propose in the next round, even though I could ask for more, my share would be worth 20% less. So if I got even $6000 in the next round, it would actually be worth $4800 to me (due to 20% inflation), which is less than the $5000 being offered now.

Given this, accepting $5000 now is better than risking a lower effective value in future rounds due to inflation.
