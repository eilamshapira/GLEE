"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair offer to Bob that considers the inflation effect on my end.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest a 55-45 split in our favor. This is a reasonable division that gives both of us a substantial portion while accounting for the 10% inflation penalty I'll face if we move to another round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2 
# Bob gain: 98 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I see that Bob is playing very aggressively. Let me make a more strategic offer.

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}

I'm offering Bob the majority share of 55% while taking 45% for myself. With the 10% inflation penalty I'm now facing, I need to secure a reasonable portion while making the offer more attractive to Bob. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges Bob's stronger negotiating position while still ensuring I receive a substantial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 0.01 
# Bob gain: 99.99 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","I see that Bob is not negotiating in good faith and is trying to exploit the inflation effects on my side. Let me try a different approach.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I receive 60% and Bob receives 40%. Given that I'm now facing over 27% inflation and Bob appears to be taking an extreme position, I need to increase my offer to compensate for the continued inflation effects. This is still a reasonable division that gives Bob a substantial portion while protecting my interests against the continuing inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
