"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split where I get 55% and you get 45%. This way we both walk away with a substantial amount, and we don't risk losing everything due to prolonged negotiations.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your previous offer, but I believe a 50/50 split is fair for both of us. Let's agree on this and ensure we both get an equal share without further delay. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Bob offers a 50-50 split ($500,000 each)
2. Due to inflation, Bob's share is worth 5% less to him in this round
3. My share would still be worth the full amount
4. If I reject, I can make another offer, but Bob's value will decrease further
5. $500,000 is still a substantial amount, and continuing negotiations risks both of us getting nothing
