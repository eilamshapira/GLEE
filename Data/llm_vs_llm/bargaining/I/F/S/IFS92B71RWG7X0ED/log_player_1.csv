# Bob gain: 575000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer is getting worse for me due to inflation, accepting a deal where I get significantly less than half is not a good long-term strategy. I need to show Bob I'm willing to play the long game."

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** This offer is getting worse and worse for me. While time pressure is increasing, accepting a 40/60 split would be very disadvantageous.  I need to show Bob I'm serious about getting a fair deal."

# Bob gain: 625000

**Reasoning:** 

The time pressure is becoming critical. While this offer is significantly less than I aimed for, rejecting it carries a massive risk of getting nothing. It's better to secure something now than risk losing everything."
