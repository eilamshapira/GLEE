"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair on the surface. However, I need to account for the inflation effect.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total money will be worth 20% less to me. That means if I were to get the entire $100 in the next round, it would only be worth $80 to me due to inflation.

Since Alice is offering me $50 now, and the maximum value I could get in the next round (even if I somehow got all $100) would be $80, rejecting doesn't seem strategically advantageous unless I believe I can get significantly more than 62.5% of the pot in the next round.

Given that a 50-50 split is objectively fair and I face significant inflation risk, I'll accept this offer.
