"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to propose a split of $100, keeping in mind that the value of the money decreases by 20% each round. Since this is round 1, I will aim for a favorable split but still make it reasonable enough for Bob to accept.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob is offering me $40, which is worth 20% less than it would have been in round 1. So, it's effectively worth $40 * 0.8 = $32 in round 1 dollars.

I will accept this offer.
