"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly and avoid inflation losses! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice proposes a 50-50 split, which is fair
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 20% less for me in the next round
3. While I could try to get more by making a counter-offer, there's a risk of losing value due to inflation
4. A guaranteed $50 now is better than an uncertain higher amount later with inflation
