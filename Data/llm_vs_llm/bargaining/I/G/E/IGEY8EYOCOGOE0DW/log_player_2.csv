"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I believe this division is fair given my investment in the project. Let's keep it simple. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100, keeping $60 for herself. While this isn't an equal split, it's also not terribly unfair. However, if I reject, I can make my own proposal in the next round.

Since this is a negotiation game, I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-proposal. A 60-40 split in her favor without clear justification for why she deserves more seems unfair.
