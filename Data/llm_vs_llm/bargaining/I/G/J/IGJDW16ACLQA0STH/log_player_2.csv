"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is proposing a 50-50 split of the $10,000, giving each of us $5,000.

Let me think about this offer. The inflation factor is important here. For me, money doesn't lose value across rounds (0% inflation), but for Alice, money loses 10% value each round.

If I reject this offer and move to the next round, I'll get to make a counter-proposal. Since Alice faces 10% inflation, $5,000 in the next round would only be worth $4,500 to her. This gives me some negotiation leverage.

Given this information, it would be strategic for me to reject this first offer and propose a division more favorable to me in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I'm making the offer in round 2, I'll take into account that Alice faces 10% inflation per round. For her, money in this round is worth 10% less than in round 1.

If I offered her $5,000 again, it would only be worth $4,500 to her (90% of the original value). Given this dynamic, I can propose a division that's slightly more favorable to me while still giving Alice enough incentive to accept rather than move to another round where her money would lose even more value.

I'll propose a 60-40 split in my favor:

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5800 
# Alice gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has offered me $5,800 while she would take $4,200.

Let me analyze this: For Alice, the $4,200 in this round is actually worth only about $3,402 (81% of what money was worth in round 1 due to her 19% cumulative inflation). If I reject, we'll move to round 4 where I can make another offer, but Alice will face even more inflation (about 27% total), making her money worth even less.

Alice is offering me more than half of the total amount. This is a good offer for me compared to the initial 50-50 split. Given that I can keep more than half of the money and its value doesn't decrease for me over time, this seems like a reasonable deal.
