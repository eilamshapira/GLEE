Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the impact of inflation, I propose a split of 55% for me and 45% for you, Alice. This is fair given the decreasing value of money each round.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, given the ongoing inflation and the fact that we're losing value each round, I suggest a 52.5% for me and 47.5% for you. This proposal is a compromise considering the urgency to settle before our shares diminish further.

# Bob gain: 525000

This offer is barely better than his last one, and time is on my side more than his since he seems more concerned about inflation. I'll hold out for a slightly better offer."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, with inflation reducing our money's value by nearly 20% already, I propose a 51% for me and 49% for you. We're running out of time and need to reach an agreement soon to minimize our losses. 
# Alice gain: 490000 
# Bob gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is still not ideal, but it's getting too risky.  The inflation is eating away at the total, and Bob seems pretty set on getting over 50%. Better to accept a slightly less favorable offer than risk getting nothing at all."
