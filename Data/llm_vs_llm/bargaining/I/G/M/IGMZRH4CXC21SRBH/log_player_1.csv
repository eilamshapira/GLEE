Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given that your share loses 20% value each round, this 60-40 split is actually better for you now than the original 50-50 would be after another round. Let's make a deal that makes sense for both of us.

# Bob gain: 6000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given that your share has already lost 44% of its value, this $3000 now is worth more to you than a larger amount in future rounds. Remember, if we don't reach an agreement within 12 rounds, we both get nothing. This is a pragmatic offer considering the inflation impact.
