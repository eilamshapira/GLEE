"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly down the middle, 50-50. It's a good start for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Since Alice's money loses 20% value each round, while mine maintains its value, I have an advantage by waiting. If Alice gets $5000 next round, it will only be worth $4000 to her, while my share would maintain its full value.

Given this dynamic, I can likely get a better deal by making a counter-proposal in the next round. Alice should be motivated to accept a less equal split to avoid further devaluation of her share.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice's money loses 20% value each round, I should propose a split that reflects this disadvantage she now has. The $5000 she would have gotten in round 1 is now worth only $4000 to her. I'll propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which is actually more favorable to her now than waiting another round.

{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Given that your share loses 20% value each round, this 60-40 split is actually better for you now than the original 50-50 would be after another round. Let's make a deal that makes sense for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation impact on my share, I propose a 48-52 split. This is a fair compromise given the circumstances, and it's still better for you than my last offer. 
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this. Alice is offering me $5200, which is better than her initial offer of $5000. However, for her, the $4800 she's asking for is actually only worth $3072 (64% of $4800) due to the 36% inflation she's experiencing.

If I reject this and we go to the next round, her money will be worth even less (44% less than the first round), which means I could potentially negotiate an even better deal. However, we also risk the possibility of not reaching an agreement within the 12 rounds.

Given that we're only in round 3 and I still have room to negotiate for a better deal, and considering how much Alice's share is devaluing...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice's money has already lost 44% of its value in this round, I should propose a split that reflects this significant disadvantage. If she waits another round, her share will lose even more value. I'll propose a split that gives me a larger share while still being more valuable to her than waiting further rounds.

{""bob_gain"": 7000,
""alice_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""Given that your share has already lost 44% of its value, this $3000 now is worth more to you than a larger amount in future rounds. Remember, if we don't reach an agreement within 12 rounds, we both get nothing. This is a pragmatic offer considering the inflation impact.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given the significant impact of inflation on my share, I'm proposing a 40-60 split. This offer still gives you a majority while ensuring I get a reasonable amount considering the diminishing value of money for me. Let's reach an agreement soon to avoid losing everything. 
# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer carefully:

1. Alice is offering me $6000, which is better than her previous offers
2. For Alice, the $4000 she's asking for is only worth $1638.40 due to the 59.04% inflation (40.96% of original value)
3. We're now in round 5 out of 12, so there's still time but we need to be mindful of reaching an agreement
4. If we go to the next round, her money will be worth even less (about 67% less than the first round)

While I could potentially get an even better deal by waiting, the risk of not reaching an agreement increases with each round. This offer gives me a solid 60% of the total, and Alice is already taking a significant hit due to inflation.
