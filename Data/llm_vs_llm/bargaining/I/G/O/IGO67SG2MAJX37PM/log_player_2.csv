"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly to avoid the effects of inflation. This offer gives you a substantial amount while ensuring we both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $400,000 out of $1,000,000
2. If I reject, we move to round 2, where:
   * The money will be worth 10% less to me
   * I get to make the next offer
   * $400,000 now is better than $450,000 in the next round due to inflation

While a 40-60 split isn't perfectly equal, it's a reasonable first offer. If I reject, inflation will eat into my gains, and there's no guarantee Alice will accept a better offer from me in the next round. Getting $400,000 right now is better than risking further negotiations with inflation effects.
