517378.0,482622.0,"Bob, I propose the following division for Round 1: I take $517378 and you get $482622. Given that with every round the total value drops by 20%, this offer is calibrated so that if you reject, your future prospect—as the proposer in Round 2—will be worth roughly $537680 in discounted terms. This split is derived via backward induction from the final round (where the proposer can claim nearly 100% of the pot) and secures both our interests now. Please accept so we avoid further devaluation.",Alice,1,
