"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 517378, ""bob_gain"": 482622, ""message"": ""Bob, I propose the following division for Round 1: I take $517,378 and you get $482,622. Given that with every round the total value drops by 20%, this offer is calibrated so that if you reject, your future prospect—as the proposer in Round 2—will be worth roughly $537,680 in discounted terms. This split is derived via backward induction from the final round (where the proposer can claim nearly 100% of the pot) and secures both our interests now. Please accept so we avoid further devaluation.""}"
