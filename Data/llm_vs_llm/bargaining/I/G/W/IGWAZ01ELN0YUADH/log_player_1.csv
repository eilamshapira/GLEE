"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
``` 

Reasoning:

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money is decreasing for me each round. It's important to secure a reasonable amount sooner rather than later.
* **Bob's rejection:** Bob rejecting my initial offer suggests he might be aiming for a larger share than 40%. 
* **My previous rejection:** My rejection of Bob's offer in round 2 shows him I'm also aiming for a significant share and won't accept anything too low.

This offer is a compromise, tilting the scales slightly in my favor while still being potentially acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Reasoning:

The value of the money is rapidly decreasing for me. While Bob's offer is less than my ideal outcome, it's better to accept a smaller share now than risk getting even less in future rounds due to inflation."
