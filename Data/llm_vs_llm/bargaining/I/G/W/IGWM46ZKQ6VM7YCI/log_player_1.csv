"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because you face 20% depreciation per round, so taking this deal now is better than waiting.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it fairly, considering the depreciation. This offer gives us both a reasonable share. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Reasoning (not part of response): I should reject because Bob's offer gives me less than what I offered initially, and I don't face any depreciation. I can make a better offer in the next round, and Bob's share will be worth even less to him due to inflation, increasing my bargaining power."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6500, 
""bob_gain"": 3500, 
""message"": ""Bob, due to the 20% depreciation you face each round, your $3500 now is worth more than waiting for a better deal later. This is the most rational economic choice for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's find a middle ground. This offer is more favorable to you than my previous one, considering the depreciation I'm facing. 
# Alice gain: 6200 
# Bob gain: 3800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Reasoning (not part of response): I'll accept this offer because:
1. It's quite close to my preferred split (only $300 less than my last offer)
2. Bob is already facing significant depreciation (48.8%)
3. Continuing to negotiate might lead to worse outcomes for both of us
4. There's risk in continuing further as we have limited rounds
5. This is a reasonable compromise that gives me 62% of the total amount"
