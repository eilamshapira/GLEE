"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because you face 20% depreciation per round, so taking this deal now is better than waiting. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the actual value I'm considering is 80% of $10,000, which is $8,000. To make a fair offer, I'll consider this value.

{""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, considering the depreciation. This offer gives us both a reasonable share.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, due to the 20% depreciation you face each round, your $3500 now is worth more than waiting for a better deal later. This is the most rational economic choice for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Considering the depreciation, the money is now worth 64% of its original value to me (100% - 20% - 20% = 64% of the original value, or 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64). So, I'm effectively negotiating over $6,400 (0.64 * $10,000).

""alice_gain"": 6200, 
""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground. This offer is more favorable to you than my previous one, considering the depreciation I'm facing.""}"
