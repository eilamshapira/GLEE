"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's calculate the impact of inflation. Since the initial amount was $1,000,000, and there's a 10% loss each round, in Round 2 the money is worth $1,000,000 * 0.90 = $900,000.

Now, consider Bob's offer: Alice gets $500,000, and Bob gets $500,000. This is equivalent to Alice getting 500000/900000 = 55.5% of the total value of the round.

Here's my decision:
