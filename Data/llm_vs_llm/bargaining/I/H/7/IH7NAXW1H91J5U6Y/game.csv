600000.0,400000.0,Hey Bob! Let's settle this quickly. How about you take $400000 and I take $600000? It's a good deal before inflation eats our money!,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Alice, since inflation affects me more, I think it's fair for me to take $550000 while you get $450000. Let's end this soon before our money loses more value!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
525000.0,475000.0,"Hi Bob, given the inflation impacts, let's try a more balanced split. How about you take $475000 and I take $525000? This way we both mitigate the inflation loss a bit better.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, inflation is hitting me hard, reducing my share's value significantly. Let's settle on $600000 for me and $400000 for you. It's a fair deal considering the rapid decrease in value for me. Let's end this now!",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
515000.0,485000.0,"Bob, I understand the impact of inflation on both sides. How about you take $485000 and I take $515000? This way, we're closer to even, and it's a better situation for both of us than before. Let's settle this now.",Alice,5,

350000.0,650000.0,"Alice, inflation is now taking a huge toll on my share, reducing its value by nearly 60%. To make this fair, I propose $650000 for me and $350000 for you. We need to end this quickly before it gets worse!",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
505000.0,495000.0,"Bob, I know the numbers are challenging due to inflation, but let's try to keep it as fair as possible. How about you take $495000 and I take $505000? We're almost at an even split, and it minimizes our losses. Let's wrap this up before we lose more.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"Alice, with inflation reducing my share's value by over 70%, I need to propose $700000 for me and $300000 for you. It's critical we end this now before the value drops even further!",Bob,8,
