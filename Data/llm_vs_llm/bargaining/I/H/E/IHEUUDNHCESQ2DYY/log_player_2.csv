Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given the inflation rates, the $10,000 is now worth:

- For Bob: 10000 * (1 - 0.2)^3 = $4096
- For Alice: 10000 * (1 - 0.1)^3 = $7290

Considering this, I'll make the following offer:

{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500}"
