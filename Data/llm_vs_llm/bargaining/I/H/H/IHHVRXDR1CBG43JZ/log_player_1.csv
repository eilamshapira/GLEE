"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your initial offer, but considering the 10% inflation, I think a split of $550000 for me and $450000 for you is more fair this round. Let's settle this before the money loses more value. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
