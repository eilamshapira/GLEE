"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a division that considers both our interests and the inflation pressure we face. Since Bob faces higher inflation (10% vs my 5%), I'll offer a slightly larger share to incentivize early acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200}

I propose this split because it's fair enough to be acceptable while giving me a good portion. If Bob rejects, both of us will lose value due to inflation, so this is a reasonable first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob is offering me $4500
2. Due to 5% inflation, this $4500 is actually worth $4275 to me
3. If I reject, we go to next round where I can make an offer, but:
   - Values will decrease another 5% for me and 10% for Bob
   - Bob might reject again, leading to further losses

Comparing this to my initial offer that was rejected:
- My original offer would have given me $5800
- This offer gives me $4275 (after inflation)
- That's a significant drop

However, if I reject and we continue, inflation will keep eating into the total value. Also, Bob might be even less cooperative in later rounds.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

The loss from inflation makes it better to accept now than risk further devaluation in future rounds."
