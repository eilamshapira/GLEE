"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob! How about we split the $100 such that I take $60 and you take $40? I think it's a fair offer considering this is the first round and we want to secure as much as we can before any devaluation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. If I reject, we move to round 2 where:
- I can make a counter-offer
- The total money will be worth $95 (5% less)
- I might be able to get a better share

2. Alice's current offer:
- Gives me $40
- Is quite uneven (60/40 split)
- No risk of devaluation

While I could try to negotiate for a more equal split in the next round, the 5% devaluation means we'd only have $95 to split. Even if I got a 50/50 split then, I'd only get $47.50, which is less than a 60/40 split of the full $100 now.

Therefore, despite the uneven split, it's more rational to accept this offer.
