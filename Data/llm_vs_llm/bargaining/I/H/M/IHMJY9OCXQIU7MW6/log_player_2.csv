"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the money with me taking 5500 and you taking 4500. This way, we both get a fair share considering the risk of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice is offering me $4500 out of $10000
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 10% less for me in the next round
3. If I reject and propose my own split, Alice might reject it, leading to further inflation
4. $4500 now is better than a potentially higher amount that's worth less due to inflation
5. This is a reasonable first offer, slightly in Alice's favor but not extremely unfair
