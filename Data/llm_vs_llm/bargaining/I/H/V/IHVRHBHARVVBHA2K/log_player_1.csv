"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice. It's the fairest way to go, and we both get to keep more money by avoiding the inflation penalty. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. It's a fair 50-50 split, and Bob is right that we'll both lose more money if we continue negotiating due to the inflation penalty. With the 5% inflation already applied to this round, accepting now is better than continuing to negotiate and facing further depreciation."
