"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a proposal for dividing the $1,000,000. Since inflation affects me by 10% each round, I should aim for a fair deal that Bob would likely accept to avoid losing value.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split, with each of us getting $500,000. This is a fair division that respects both our interests equally."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make another proposal. I see that Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation pressure on me, but I still have several rounds to negotiate.

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}

I propose this split which gives Bob a bit more than me, acknowledging the inflation pressure I face while still securing a fair portion for myself."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I notice Bob is slowly increasing his offers to me, but still trying to take advantage of my inflation pressure. I'll continue negotiating but make a slightly more generous offer to try to reach an agreement.

{""alice_gain"": 440000, ""bob_gain"": 560000}

I propose this split which gives Bob $560,000 and me $440,000, recognizing the inflation impact on my side while trying to find a middle ground we can both accept."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I see that Bob is slowly increasing his offers but still taking advantage of my inflation pressure. With the inflation now at over 40%, I need to be more strategic about reaching an agreement soon.

{""alice_gain"": 430000, ""bob_gain"": 570000}

I propose this split of $430,000 for me and $570,000 for Bob, moving closer to his last offer to try to reach an agreement that accounts for the increasing inflation impact on my side."
