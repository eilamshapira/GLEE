70.0,30.0,"Hi Bob! I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor. Since we're dealing with inflation affecting me at 10% per round, this initial split helps offset my future losses if we need multiple rounds. Let's try to agree quickly to maximize our total value!",Alice,1,

65.0,35.0,"Hi Alice, in light of the inflation hitting us each round, I propose we settle now with a split of $35 for me and $65 for you. This deal allows both of us to avoid further losses, and while I slightly improve my position compared to last round, youâ€™re still receiving a fair share considering the cost of delay. I hope we can agree to finalize now rather than risk additional depreciation.",Bob,2,
