"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor. Since we're dealing with inflation affecting me at 10% per round, this initial split helps offset my future losses if we need multiple rounds. Let's try to agree quickly to maximize our total value!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, in light of the inflation hitting us each round, I propose we settle now with a split of $35 for me and $65 for you. This deal allows both of us to avoid further losses, and while I slightly improve my position compared to last round, youâ€™re still receiving a fair share considering the cost of delay. I hope we can agree to finalize now rather than risk additional depreciation. 
# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
