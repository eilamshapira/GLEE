"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor. Since we're dealing with inflation affecting me at 10% per round, this initial split helps offset my future losses if we need multiple rounds. Let's try to agree quickly to maximize our total value! 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 35, ""alice_gain"": 65, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, in light of the inflation hitting us each round, I propose we settle now with a split of $35 for me and $65 for you. This deal allows both of us to avoid further losses, and while I slightly improve my position compared to last round, youâ€™re still receiving a fair share considering the cost of delay. I hope we can agree to finalize now rather than risk additional depreciation.""}"
