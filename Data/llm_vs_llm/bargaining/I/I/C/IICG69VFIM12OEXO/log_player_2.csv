"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, considering the inflation risk. I'm offering you $4500. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me $4500 out of $10,000, which means she's keeping $5500. While this isn't a 50-50 split, I need to consider that:

1. If I reject, the money will be worth 10% less for me in the next round
2. Even if I make a counter-offer, Alice might reject it
3. $4500 now is better than $5000 in the next round (which would be worth $4500 to me due to inflation)
4. We have limited rounds, and prolonging the negotiation could lead to both of us getting nothing

Given these factors, while the split isn't perfectly even, it's a reasonable first offer and the inflation risk makes it worthwhile to accept.
