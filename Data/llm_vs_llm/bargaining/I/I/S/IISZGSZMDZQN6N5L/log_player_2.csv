"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer is $40 for me
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, any amount in the next round will be worth 5% less to me
4. If I reject, $40 in the next round would only be worth $38 to me

While I could try to negotiate for more, the inflation penalty makes accepting a decent offer now more attractive than waiting. $40 is a reasonable share, even though it's less than half. If I reject, I risk getting even less value due to inflation.
