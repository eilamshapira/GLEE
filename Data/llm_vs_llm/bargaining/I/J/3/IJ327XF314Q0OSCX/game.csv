6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we split $10000 by giving me $6000 and you $4000. Accepting this offer now means we both secure full value, while any delay costs me 20% per round. I believe this is a fair deal to move forward without risking further discountâ€”what do you say?",Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, let's be fair. I propose $5500 for me and $4500 for you. The inflation is hurting us both. This is a much more balanced split.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, thank you for your proposal. Considering that the money I would receive in this round is worth 20% less than in round 1, accepting $4500 now (which effectively amounts to $3600 in round-1 value) is a practical move. Let's secure the deal and avoid further devaluation.",Alice,2,accept
