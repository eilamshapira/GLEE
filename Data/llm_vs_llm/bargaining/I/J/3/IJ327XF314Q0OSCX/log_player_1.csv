"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split $10,000 by giving me $6,000 and you $4,000. Accepting this offer now means we both secure full value, while any delay costs me 20% per round. I believe this is a fair deal to move forward without risking further discountâ€”what do you say?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be fair. I propose $5500 for me and $4500 for you. The inflation is hurting us both. This is a much more balanced split. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your proposal. Considering that the money I would receive in this round is worth 20% less than in round 1, accepting $4500 now (which effectively amounts to $3600 in round-1 value) is a practical move. Let's secure the deal and avoid further devaluation.""}"
