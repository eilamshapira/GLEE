"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split $10000 by giving me $6000 and you $4000. Accepting this offer now means we both secure full value, while any delay costs me 20% per round. I believe this is a fair deal to move forward without risking further discountâ€”what do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000
