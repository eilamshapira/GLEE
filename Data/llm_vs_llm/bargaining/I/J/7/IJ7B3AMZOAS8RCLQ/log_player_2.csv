"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each round, I'll try to make a fair offer. Considering the inflation, I'll propose a division that's slightly in my favor to account for the decreasing value.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $350,000 I would gain is actually worth about 64% of its original value (1 - 0.36 = 0.64), which is approximately $224,000 in round 1 terms.

Given this, I think Alice's offer is not favorable to me. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth even less for me now (48.4% less than in round 1, calculated as 1 - (1 - 0.2)(1 - 0.2)(1 - 0.2) = 1 - 0.512 = 0.488, but I will use the exact numbers: 
Round 1 to Round 2: 1 - 0.2 = 0.8
Round 2 to Round 3: 0.8 - 0.2 * 0.8 = 0.64
Round 3 to Round 4: 0.64 - 0.2 * 0.64 = 0.512), I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to account for the decreasing value.
