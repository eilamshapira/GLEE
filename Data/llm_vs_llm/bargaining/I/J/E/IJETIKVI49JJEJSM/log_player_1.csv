"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40. Fair for both of us, given inflation will hurt me next round.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, since you face 5% inflation per round and I don't, a 55/45 split is actually fair. Your $4500 now is worth more than a higher amount in future rounds after inflation. This is a balanced proposal that acknowledges our different situations. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
