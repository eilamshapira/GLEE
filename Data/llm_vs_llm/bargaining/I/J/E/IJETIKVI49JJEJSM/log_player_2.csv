"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40. Fair for both of us, given inflation will hurt me next round. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000 of the $10,000 total.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, I should remember that while the money keeps the same value for me, it loses 5% of its value for Alice. This gives me some negotiating leverage.

Alice is offering me less than half, and I believe I can get a better deal in the next round given the inflation asymmetry.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer that accounts for the inflation effect while still being reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Alice, since you face 5% inflation per round and I don't, a 55/45 split is actually fair. Your $4,500 now is worth more than a higher amount in future rounds after inflation. This is a balanced proposal that acknowledges our different situations.""}"
