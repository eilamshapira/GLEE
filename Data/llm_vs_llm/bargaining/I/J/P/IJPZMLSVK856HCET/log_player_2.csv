Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm countering with $58 for me and $42 for you. Inflation is eating away at the value, and I need to account for that. This is a reasonable offer considering the circumstances. Let's close this deal! 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58
