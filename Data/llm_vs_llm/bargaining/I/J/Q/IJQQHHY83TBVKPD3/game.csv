6000.0,4000.0,"I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair since if you reject, the money will be worth less for both of us, especially for you with your 20% depreciation rate.",Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"Let's aim for a slightly more balanced split. A 55-45 split in my favor acknowledges that both our values drop, but mine drops more. This way, we both get a fair deal.",Bob,2,

5800.0,4200.0,"Let's be practical here. I'm offering you 4200$ which, even with two rounds of 20% depreciation, is better than waiting further. My 10% depreciation rate means I can afford to be patient, but you lose more value with each round. This is a fair offer considering our different positions.",Alice,3,
