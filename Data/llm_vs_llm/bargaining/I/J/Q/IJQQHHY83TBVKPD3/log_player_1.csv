Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's aim for a slightly more balanced split. A 55-45 split in my favor acknowledges that both our values drop, but mine drops more. This way, we both get a fair deal. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The money is worth less now, but Bob's proposed split gives me significantly less than what I offered initially. Given that my inflation rate (10%) is lower than Bob's (20%), I'll make a counter-offer in the next round that better reflects our relative positions."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, 
""bob_gain"": 4200, 
""message"": ""Let's be practical here. I'm offering you 4200$ which, even with two rounds of 20% depreciation, is better than waiting further. My 10% depreciation rate means I can afford to be patient, but you lose more value with each round. This is a fair offer considering our different positions.""}"
