"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair since if you reject, the money will be worth less for both of us, especially for you with your 20% depreciation rate. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's aim for a slightly more balanced split. A 55-45 split in my favor acknowledges that both our values drop, but mine drops more. This way, we both get a fair deal.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be practical here. I'm offering you 4200$ which, even with two rounds of 20% depreciation, is better than waiting further. My 10% depreciation rate means I can afford to be patient, but you lose more value with each round. This is a fair offer considering our different positions. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
