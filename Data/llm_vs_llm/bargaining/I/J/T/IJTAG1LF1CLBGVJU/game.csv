990000.0,10000.0,Let's start fair. I'll take 99% and you get 1%.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
50000.0,950000.0,"Alice, considering the potential risk of inflation on future rounds and the need for a swift resolution, I offer a quick closure: you'll receive $50000 and I take $950000. Accepting this offer secures your share immediately without the uncertainty of further delays.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
900000.0,100000.0,"I'm not happy with your last offer. I'm willing to split it more evenly now. 90% for me, 10% for you. Let's get this done.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
70000.0,930000.0,"Alice, with each delay your share loses value while mine remains stable. To avoid further depreciation of your payout, I propose an immediate settlement: I take $930000 and you get $70000. Accepting now secures you a better real value than risking further rounds.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
800000.0,200000.0,"Bob, your offer is becoming increasingly unfair. I'm willing to take 80%, but you need to accept something closer to a 50/50 split. This game isn't going anywhere with your offers.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
760000.0,240000.0,"Alice, every round we delay further erodes the real value of your share due to inflation. I know you had a 200k/800k proposal earlier, but waiting will only worsen the situation. By accepting this offer now, you secure 760000 immediately—preserving more of your value than if we drag this out further. Let’s settle this fairly and quickly.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
750000.0,250000.0,"Bob, we're nearing the end of this game. You're consistently trying to exploit inflation to get a better deal. I'm offering you 250k, which is more than your last offer. Let's end this fairly.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
740000.0,260000.0,"Alice, we're in round 8 and time is of the essence. With each delay, your share loses more value while mine remains constant. By accepting this offer, you receive a full $740000 now, avoiding any further depreciation. Let's settle this swiftly and secure our outcomes before the next round's inflation hits even harder.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
700000.0,300000.0,"Bob, your tactics are getting old. This inflation is hurting both of us, but I'm still willing to compromise. You get 300k, but I need at least 700k. This is the last offer I'll make before we both lose everything.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
680000.0,320000.0,"Alice, each additional round means your share suffers further devaluation due to inflation. While your previous offer gave you 700K nominally, the effective value of that is already lower. Accepting 680K now ensures that you preserve more of your real value than if we drag this on further. Let's resolve this now before the situation worsens.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, this is it. We're on the brink of losing everything. You're being stubborn, and we're both hurting because of it. Take the 350k, let's end this, and at least get something.",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,reject
640000.0,360000.0,"Alice, this is our final round. I know you've held out for a more favorable split in previous rounds, but the harsh reality of inflation now means that every dollar you delay receiving loses significantly in value—your share is now worth roughly 46% less in real terms. Accepting this final offer guarantees you a nominal $640000 (about $345600 in real value), which is far better than ending up with nothing. Let's conclude this game with certainty and secure what we each can have.",Bob,12,
