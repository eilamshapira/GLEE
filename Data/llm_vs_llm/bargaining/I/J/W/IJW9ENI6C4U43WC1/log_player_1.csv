"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer to Bob that takes into account the different inflation rates we're facing.

Since Bob faces a higher inflation rate (20% vs my 10%), he has more incentive to agree quickly. However, I should still make a fair offer that he's likely to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose this division because it's reasonably fair while giving me a slight advantage. If Bob rejects and we go to the next round, the total value decreases for both of us, but more significantly for him due to his higher inflation rate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
