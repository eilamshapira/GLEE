"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think a 50-50 split is fair for both of us. While you face higher inflation (20% vs my 5%), we're still early in the game and this gives us both a good outcome. A fair split now means we both walk away happy. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
