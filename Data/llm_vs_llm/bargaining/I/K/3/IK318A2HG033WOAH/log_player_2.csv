"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with 80% for me and 20% for you. This way, we both get something right away. 
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer gives me only $20, which is a rather small portion of the total $100. Since the money loses value differently for us (5% per round for me vs 20% for round for Alice), I have less pressure to agree quickly. I think I can propose a more balanced split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split given our different inflation pressures.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I think a 50-50 split is fair for both of us. While you face higher inflation (20% vs my 5%), we're still early in the game and this gives us both a good outcome. A fair split now means we both walk away happy.""}"
