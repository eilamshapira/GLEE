"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'm offering you 40% of the money, hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $4,000 in the first round
2. If I reject, the next offer I make will be worth 5% less due to inflation
3. If negotiations drag on, the value keeps decreasing
4. The initial offer of 40% is somewhat low, but not terribly unfair

While I could try to negotiate for more, the inflation penalty means I'm taking a risk by rejecting. Each round reduces the total value I could get. A quick resolution with a decent amount might be better than trying to maximize my share.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this time and make a counter-offer, but I should aim to conclude negotiations soon to minimize inflation impact."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer while acknowledging the time pressure we both face:

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""I propose a 50-50 split, which is the fairest solution. We should agree quickly to avoid losing value to inflation.""}

This is a reasonable strategy because:
1. A 50-50 split is the most equitable solution
2. It's a significant improvement for me compared to the previous 40-60 split
3. The message emphasizes our mutual interest in reaching a quick agreement
4. It's not too aggressive of a counter-offer, making it more likely to be accepted"
