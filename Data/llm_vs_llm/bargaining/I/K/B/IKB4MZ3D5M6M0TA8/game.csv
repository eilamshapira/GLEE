60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, let's secure a swift and mutually beneficial agreement. By accepting this offer, we both avoid further loss of value â€“ especially as delays hit you harder with a 20% decline per round. I believe a 60/40 split is fair given the subsequent discounts. Looking forward to your acceptance!",Alice,1,
