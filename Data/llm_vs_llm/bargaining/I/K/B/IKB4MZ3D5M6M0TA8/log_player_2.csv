"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's secure a swift and mutually beneficial agreement. By accepting this offer, we both avoid further loss of value â€“ especially as delays hit you harder with a 20% decline per round. I believe a 60/40 split is fair given the subsequent discounts. Looking forward to your acceptance! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider the fairness of Alice's offer and the impact of inflation on future rounds.

If I reject, we move to round 2 where I make an offer, but my $40 would be worth 20% less ($32 equivalent value), and Alice's $60 would be worth 10% less ($54 equivalent value).

If we continue disagreeing, the value diminishes quickly for both of us, with mine decreasing faster. By round 12, we'd get nothing.

While a 50/50 split might seem fairest initially, the asymmetric inflation rates actually make Alice's 60/40 offer reasonable, as delaying would hurt me more than her.
