60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $60 while you get $40. Given that waiting only reduces the overall value (with your share devaluing by 20% each round), I believe this split is a fair and efficient way to secure a good deal for both of us right away. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",Alice,1,
