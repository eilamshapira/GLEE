"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $60 while you get $40. Given that waiting only reduces the overall value (with your share devaluing by 20% each round), I believe this split is a fair and efficient way to secure a good deal for both of us right away. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 60-40 split in her favor.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value decreases. For me, the $100 becomes worth only $80 after one round (20% decrease), while for Alice it becomes $90 (10% decrease).

If we continue to later rounds, the money will be worth even less for both of us, with my value decreasing faster. This gives Alice some leverage in negotiations.

While a 50-50 split might seem fair initially, the asymmetric devaluation means I should consider accepting a reasonable offer early.

A 60-40 split gives me $40 now, which is better than potentially getting a larger percentage of a smaller pie later, especially with my faster devaluation rate.
