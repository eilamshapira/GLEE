"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to make an offer to Bob, keeping in mind the depreciation of the money for him over time. I want to get as much as possible for myself, but I also need to make it attractive enough for Bob to accept, considering his depreciation rate.

Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6800 
# Bob gain: 3200 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this.

Bob is offering me $6800. Since my money hasn't depreciated, this is a straight $6800. Bob gets $3200, but it's worth 20% less to him than the $4000 he would have gotten in the first round. 20% of $4000 is $800, so the $3200 he is now getting is roughly the same as what the $4000 would be. Therefore, it's beneficial for him to still consider the decision.

I need to decide if getting $6800 now is better than potentially making a different (and better) offer in the next round, bearing in mind Bob's money will further depreciate. If Bob is playing rationally, his offers will only get worse from my perspective.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
