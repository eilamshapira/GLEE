"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to make an offer to Bob, keeping in mind the inflation in future rounds. I also need to ensure I get a reasonable amount considering I'm going first.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

My reasoning:

*   I'm taking a slightly larger share because I'm making the initial offer.
*   This split gives Bob a significant portion, which should make it appealing for him to accept.
*   If we proceed to the next round, the money will be worth less, so a quick resolution is beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 168534 
# Bob gain: 831466 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob's offer is significantly skewed in his favor. My gain is only 168,534, while he gets 831,466. This is unacceptable, especially considering the inflation. I will reject this offer.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, it's my turn to make an offer again. I need to consider that the money is now worth 20% less to me than in round 1 (10% per round), and 10% less to Bob (5% per round). Bob clearly wants a large share, but I also need to ensure I get a decent amount to make this worthwhile.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

Reasoning:

*   I'm slightly lowering my ask compared to round 1 to increase the chance of acceptance.
*   I'm still aiming for a majority, acknowledging the disadvantage of going second in the previous round.
*   This gives Bob a better deal than my initial offer, hoping he will find it more attractive and avoid further losses due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob's offer is closer to a fair split this time. 480,000 for me and 520,000 for him. I need to factor in the inflation. I'm losing 27.1% compared to round 1. Let's quickly calculate what I would have gotten in round 1 that would be equivalent to this offer now. 480000 is 72.9% of X (100-27.1).
X = 480000 / 0.729 = 658436.21

If I had gotten 658436.21 in round 1 it would be the same value as 480000 now. I offered 600000 in round 1 so this is not ideal, but it is better than nothing. We are also getting closer to the deadline, so I should probably take this deal.

```json

""decision"": ""accept""
}
