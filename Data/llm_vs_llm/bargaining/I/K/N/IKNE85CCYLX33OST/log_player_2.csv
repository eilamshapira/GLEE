"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 50-50 split which is completely fair. Since inflation will reduce the total value with each round, it's in both our interests to agree now rather than delay. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer is reasonable, but I need to consider the inflation effect. If I reject now, we'll move to the next round where I can make a counteroffer, but the total value will be 20% less for me. That means the 10,000 would effectively be worth 8,000 to me in the next round.

If I accept now, I get 5,000. If I reject and make a counteroffer, even if I asked for the entire 10,000 (which Alice would likely reject), the maximum I could get would be 8,000 in my value. And realistically, I'd need to offer Alice something to make her accept.

Given the inflation penalty, accepting the 50-50 split now is better than continuing to negotiate.
