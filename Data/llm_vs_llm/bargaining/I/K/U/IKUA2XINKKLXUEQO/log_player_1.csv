"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is fair. It's closer to even, and we both get a good share before inflation hits again. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While it's slightly in Bob's favor, it's a reasonable split and we'll both lose more value if we continue negotiating due to inflation. Getting $45 now is better than risking further devaluation of the total amount."
