"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer to Bob considering the inflation rates for both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose we split the money 55/45, with me getting $55 and you getting $45. This is fair considering that inflation affects you more heavily at 20% per round compared to my 5%, so waiting is costlier for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll adjust my offer considering our inflation rates and the negotiations so far.

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}

I propose I get $52 and you get $48. This is a reasonable compromise that acknowledges both our positions. Given that inflation impacts you at 20% per round and me at only 5%, reaching an agreement sooner is particularly beneficial for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll adjust my offer again, considering our inflation rates and the progression of negotiations.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose a 50/50 split - $50 for each of us. This is a perfectly fair division that benefits us both. With your inflation rate at 20% per round compared to my 5%, reaching an agreement now will preserve significantly more value for you than continuing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","I notice we're already at round 7, and inflation is significantly impacting both of us - especially Bob. Let me make a more accommodating offer.

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}

I propose I get $45 and you get $55. This gives you the majority of the money and is a considerable concession from my side. Given that we're in round 7 and your inflation rate is 20% per round (compared to my 5%), accepting this deal now would be much better for both of us than continuing negotiations."
