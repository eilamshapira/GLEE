Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

I'm rejecting this offer. While it's slightly better for me, it's important to remember that the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me.  I need to aim for a much larger share to make up for the inflation."

This is a tough one, but I have to reject. While 50/50 seems fair at face value, the rapid inflation means I need a larger share to make up for the diminishing value.  I'm willing to gamble on a few more rounds."

The inflation is really hurting now, and this offer is better than what I proposed last round. Taking a smaller share now is better than risking getting nothing at all."
