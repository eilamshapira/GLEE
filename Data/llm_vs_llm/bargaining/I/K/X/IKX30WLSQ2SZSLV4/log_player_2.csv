"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. It's a fair 50-50 split
2. If I reject, next round the money will be worth 20% less (only $80 total)
3. Even if I make a more favorable proposal next round, Alice might reject it, leading to further devaluation

The 50-50 split is fair and guarantees me $50. Any attempt to get more could result in both of us getting less due to inflation.
