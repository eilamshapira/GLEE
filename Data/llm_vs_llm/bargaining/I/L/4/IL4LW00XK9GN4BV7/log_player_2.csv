Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

Even with the devaluation, accepting Alice's offer in round 3 is better than risking getting even less in subsequent rounds.  Here's why:

* **Round 3 Offer:** Bob receives $5500, which is worth 81% of its original value due to inflation, resulting in an effective gain of $4455.

* **Potential Future Offers:**  If Bob rejects Alice's offer, the value of his potential gain decreases further in each round. There's no guarantee that Alice will offer a better deal, and she's likely to exploit the inflation to her advantage.

Therefore, accepting the current offer minimizes potential losses due to inflation."
