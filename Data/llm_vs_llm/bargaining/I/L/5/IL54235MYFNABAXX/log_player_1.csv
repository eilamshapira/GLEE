Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's aim for a fairer split. I'm proposing 5200 for me and 4800 for you. It's still a good amount for both of us, and we avoid the inflation hit. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Reasoning (not part of response): Given the 10% inflation penalty per round, accepting this offer now is better than risking further rounds. The current value of my $4800 after one round of inflation (90% of original value) is equivalent to $4320, which is still a reasonable amount. If I reject and we continue negotiating, my future gains would be worth even less due to compounding inflation. Additionally, since Bob's counter-offer is relatively fair (48/52 split), it's better to secure this deal now rather than risk getting a worse deal later or potentially ending up with nothing if we can't agree within the remaining rounds."
