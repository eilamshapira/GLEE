"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me make a fair first offer, considering that the money will be worth less in future rounds due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split, which is fair and reasonable. This way, both of us can walk away with a significant amount, and we avoid the risk of losing value to inflation in subsequent rounds."
