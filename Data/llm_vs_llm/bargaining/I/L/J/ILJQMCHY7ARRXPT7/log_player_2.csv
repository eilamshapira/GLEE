"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me $40, keeping $60 for herself. While this isn't an even split, I should consider:

1. If I reject, we move to round 2 where I can make an offer
2. For Alice, the money will be worth 10% less in round 2 ($90 total value for her)
3. My money keeps its full value
4. I can likely make a better offer in round 2 that Alice would still accept

Since I can likely get a better deal in the next round when Alice's money is worth less to her, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice's money is now worth 10% less to her (so $100 is actually worth $90 to her), I can use this to make a more balanced offer.

{""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly - this is actually better for you than your first offer since waiting has reduced the value for you by 10%""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a fair compromise 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $43, while keeping $57
2. For Alice, due to 19% inflation, her $57 is actually worth about $46.17 to her
3. My $43 maintains full value
4. If I reject, we go to round 4 where:
   - I can make another offer
   - Alice's money will be worth 27.1% less (further 10% decrease)
   - My money still maintains value

Since Alice's offer is still not very favorable to me, and I can likely get a better deal in the next round when her money is worth even less to her, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice's money is now worth 27.1% less to her, I can leverage this situation. For her, $100 is only worth about $72.90. A 50-50 split would actually be worse for her now than in round 2, so I should adjust my offer accordingly.

{""bob_gain"": 53,
""alice_gain"": 47,
""message"": ""This is actually a better deal for you than before - due to 27.1% inflation, your $47 is worth about $34.26 to you, while my previous 50-50 offer would have been worth even less to you now""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a bit more, considering future inflation 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $45, while keeping $55
2. For Alice, due to 34.39% inflation, her $55 is actually worth only about $36.09 to her
3. My $45 maintains full value
4. If I reject, we go to round 6 where:
   - I can make another offer
   - Alice's money will be worth 40.95% less
   - My money still maintains value

Although this offer is better than her previous ones, I still believe I can get a better deal in the next round when Alice's money is worth even less to her. The inflation effect is becoming quite significant now.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","With Alice's money now worth 40.95% less, I can make an offer that appears more favorable to me while still being rational for her to accept. At this point, $100 is only worth about $59.05 to her.

{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Due to the 40.95% inflation affecting you, your $45 is worth about $26.57 to you. This is actually better than rejecting and getting a larger number later when inflation will be even higher. Let's conclude this now.""}"
