5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50/50 split is the fairest solution for both of us. We each get $5000 and can both walk away happy. Since neither of us is more deserving than the other, an equal split seems most reasonable. What do you think?",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Okay Bob, I understand your perspective. But given the inflation, I need to adjust my offer slightly. I propose a 55/45 split. This is still a good deal for you, and it helps me account for the loss of value over the rounds. Let's finalize this!",Alice,3,
