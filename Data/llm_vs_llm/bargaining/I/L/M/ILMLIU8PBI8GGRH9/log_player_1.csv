Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50/50 split is the fairest solution for both of us. We each get $5000 and can both walk away happy. Since neither of us is more deserving than the other, an equal split seems most reasonable. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
