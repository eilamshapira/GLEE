"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a 60/40 split. I think this is fair, let's take the money! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get 40% ($4,000) while she takes 60% ($6,000) of the total amount. Since there's no inflation penalty for me, I don't lose money by continuing to the next round, where I would get to make a counter-proposal.

Given that I can propose my own division in the next round, and inflation doesn't affect my share, I think I can negotiate for a better split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50/50 split is the fairest solution for both of us. We each get $5,000 and can both walk away happy. Since neither of us is more deserving than the other, an equal split seems most reasonable. What do you think?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, I understand your perspective. But given the inflation, I need to adjust my offer slightly. I propose a 55/45 split. This is still a good deal for you, and it helps me account for the loss of value over the rounds. Let's finalize this! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's updated offer. She's now proposing I get 45% ($4,500) and she gets 55% ($5,500). She mentions that inflation is affecting her, which explains why she's adjusted her offer from the initial 60/40 split to a more favorable 55/45 split for me.

Since there's no inflation penalty for me (my money is worth the same as in round 1), I could reject and make another counter-offer in round 4. However, Alice's offer has improved significantly from the first round, and she may face even more inflation in future rounds.

Given that she's moved considerably in my direction (from 40% to 45% for me), and this is a reasonable compromise from the 50/50 I proposed, I'll accept this offer.
