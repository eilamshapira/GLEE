"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose to take 60$ and give Bob 40$. This is a fair split considering I'm facing value loss due to inflation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

No, I'll reject this offer. Even with 20% inflation, I can still try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round. A 45-55 split is too favorable to Bob, especially since I made a more balanced initial offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}

I propose to take 65$ and give Bob 35$. I need to increase my share to compensate for the 40% total inflation loss I'm now facing (20% per round), while still keeping the offer reasonable enough for Bob to potentially accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer. Even though I'm facing significant inflation (48.8% less value), getting only 40$ is too low. My effective value would be around $20.48 (40 * 0.512). I'll try another round, despite the increasing inflation, as Bob's offers have been getting worse rather than better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I propose to take 70$ and give Bob 30$. With the inflation now at nearly 60% (after 4 rounds of 20% each), I need a larger share to get a reasonable value. Even with 70$, due to inflation, my effective value would be around 28$ (70 * 0.4), while Bob would get his full 30$. This is still a fair offer considering the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While it's not ideal, with 6 rounds of inflation (67.23% less value), if I wait longer the situation will only get worse. With this deal:
- I get $35 * (1 - 0.6723) â‰ˆ $11.47 effective value
- Bob gets $65 full value

If I reject and we continue, the inflation will make any future gains worth even less for me, and Bob's offers seem to be getting progressively worse. Better to secure some value now than risk getting even less or nothing if we reach round 12 without agreement."
