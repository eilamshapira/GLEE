"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to split evenly, but think about it - you lose value faster with each round.  Let's make this quick. I take a bit more, you take a bit less, and we both win.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering the inflation rates, I'm willing to take a bit less than half. This way, we both get a good deal and can end this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

Alice's offer is now reasonable considering the inflation. It's better to accept a slightly smaller amount now than risk getting even less in future rounds."
