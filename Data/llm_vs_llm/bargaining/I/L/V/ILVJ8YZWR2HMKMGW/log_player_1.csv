"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","As Alice, I want to make a fair initial offer to Bob, considering that each round that passes will reduce the value of my share by 10% due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose a 55-45 split in my favor, which I think is reasonable since I'm facing inflation with each round. This gives both of us a substantial portion while acknowledging that delays will cost me more than they might cost Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider the offer carefully, taking into account the inflation penalty I'm facing.

If I accept Bob's offer now, I get $525,000, which due to 10% inflation is worth $472,500 to me (525000 Ã— 0.9).

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, even if I propose a better split for myself, the 20% cumulative inflation will significantly reduce the real value of whatever I get.

Since Bob has offered me more than half of the total amount, and the inflation penalty makes waiting costly for me, I should accept this reasonable offer.
