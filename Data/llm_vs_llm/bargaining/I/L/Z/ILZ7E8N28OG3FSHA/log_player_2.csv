"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer is quite unfair, as she's taking 90% of the money while offering me only 10%. Given that there's a 5% inflation penalty per round for me, I do need to consider that my purchasing power will decrease if I reject. However, this initial offer is so imbalanced that I believe it's worth negotiating for a better split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more balanced division that acknowledges both our positions while accounting for my inflation penalty.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an equal 50-50 split, which I believe is fair. Since I face a 5% inflation penalty per round, I'm motivated to reach an agreement soon, but the initial offer was too one-sided. This even split respects both of our interests and should be acceptable to Alice."
