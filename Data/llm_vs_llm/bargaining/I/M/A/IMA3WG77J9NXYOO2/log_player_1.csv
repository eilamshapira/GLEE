"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split, but considering Bob's money loses 20% value each round, he might be motivated to accept now rather than wait.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose this split because if Bob rejects and waits for the next round, his share will effectively be worth less due to the 20% inflation penalty he faces. This offer gives him a solid portion while still being advantageous for me."
