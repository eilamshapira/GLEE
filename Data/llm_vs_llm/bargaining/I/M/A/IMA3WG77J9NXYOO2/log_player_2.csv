"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I should consider Alice's offer carefully. She's offering me $40 out of the $100, while taking $60 for herself. Since the money loses 20% of its value for me each round, if I reject and make a counteroffer next round, the $100 pot would effectively be worth only $80 to me. This means even if I got the entire amount in round 2, it would only be worth $80 to me.

If I accept now, I get $40. If I reject and try to get more next round, I'd need to secure more than $50 (in round 2 dollars) to beat what I'm being offered now. Given that Alice has no time pressure (no inflation for her), she might not accept a very favorable offer to me.
