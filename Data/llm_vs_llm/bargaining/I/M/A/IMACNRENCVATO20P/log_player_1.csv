"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to be strategic, considering the shrinking value of the money for me with each round. Here's my initial offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **Initial Generosity:** I'm starting with a slightly more generous offer to Bob. This increases the likelihood of him accepting it immediately.
*   **My Advantage:** I still secure a substantial portion (60%) in the first round, while the money is still at its full value for me.
*   **Risk Aversion:** Delaying means my share's value depreciates. Offering a good deal upfront minimizes the chance of prolonged negotiation and value loss."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I see Bob's offer. Let's analyze:

*   **Bob's Offer:** He's offering a 50/50 split.
*   **Inflation Impact:** The money I receive *now* is worth 10% less than in Round 1.
*   **Comparison:** In Round 1, I proposed getting $6000. Getting $5000 in Round 2 means I effectively get $5000 * 0.9 = $4500 worth of value (in Round 1 terms).

Since $4500 is significantly less than my initial proposed value of $6000, and the money is going to lose 10% of it's original value for me in each round, I'll reject this.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's my turn again. The money I gain is now worth 20% less than in the first round. I need to factor this into my offer.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **Increased Share:** I'm asking for a slightly larger share ($6500) to compensate for the 20% loss in value.
*   **My Value:** $6500 in Round 3 money is worth $6500 * 0.8 = $5200 in Round 1 money.
*   **Risk:** Bob might reject again. But I believe this offer is more reasonable considering the diminishing value for me. I still need a decent return for taking the risk.
*   **Bob's Potential Strategy:** I'm guessing he wants a 50/50 split, but I hope he will see that the money I am getting is not worth the same as the money he is getting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze Bob's offer in Round 4:

*   **Bob's Offer:** $4500 for me, $5500 for him.
*   **Inflation Impact:** The money I receive now is worth 27.1% less than in Round 1.
*   **Calculation:** $4500 in Round 4 money is worth $4500 * (1 - 0.271) = $4500 * 0.729 = $3280.50 in Round 1 terms.

This is a very bad offer. The effective value I'm getting is quite low.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's Round 5. The money I gain is now worth 34.39% less than in the first round. This is getting serious!

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **Significant Increase:** I'm asking for $7000, a larger share.
*   **My Value:** $7000 in Round 5 money is worth $7000 * (1 - 0.3439) = $7000 * 0.6561 = $4592.70 in Round 1 money.
*   **Desperation:** The value is dropping fast for me. Bob has to understand that.
*   **Risk/Reward:** This is risky because it's a significantly skewed offer. However, if Bob continues to offer closer to 50/50, I'll end up with practically nothing. This aggressive offer is a calculated gamble.
*   **Inflation Rationale:** I hope Bob realizes I'm not being greedy, but rather compensating for the rapidly decreasing value of the money for me. The longer we wait, the less I effectively get."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Round 6. Bob's offer is $4000 for me, $6000 for him.

*   **Inflation:** My money is worth 40.95% less.
*   **Calculation:** $4000 * (1 - 0.4095) = $4000 * 0.5905 = $2362 in Round 1 money.

This is a terrible offer. I'm getting peanuts!

```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, Round 7. My money is worth 46.86% less. This is dire.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **Even More Aggressive:** I'm asking for $7500. It sounds outrageous, but...
*   **My Value:** $7500 * (1 - 0.4686) = $7500 * 0.5314 = $3985.50 in Round 1 money.
*   **Context:** Even with 75% of the remaining money, I'm only getting approximately $3985 worth (in the original value). If Bob continues to reject, this number will quickly decline to almost nothing.
*   **Risk of Nothing:** At this point, the risk of ending up with *nothing* is very real. I am banking on Bob realizing the inflation is killing my payout.
*   **Honest Intent:** I'm hoping Bob understands I am not trying to be unfair, but merely trying to salvage something from this situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Round 8. Bob's offer: $3500 for me, $6500 for him.

*   **Inflation:** My money is worth 52.17% less.
*   **Calculation:** $3500 * (1 - 0.5217) = $3500 * 0.4783 = $1674.05 in Round 1 money.

This is insulting. I'm getting less than $1700 worth, after starting with $10,000.

```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, Round 9. My money is worth 56.95% less. This is absolutely critical.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **Desperate Times:** I'm asking for a HUGE $8000.
*   **My Value:** $8000 * (1 - 0.5695) = $8000 * 0.4305 = $3444 in Round 1 money.
*   **Rationality:** I know this seems crazy, but I am barely getting $3500 in original money's worth. We have 3 rounds left, and I'll get almost nothing if he rejects again.
*   **The End is Near:** I am close to getting zero at this rate. This is a final, desperate attempt to salvage something.
*   **Bob's Ignorance?:** I'm starting to wonder if Bob understands (or cares) about the dramatic effect inflation has on *my* share. It feels like he is proposing a 50/50 split while ignoring the decay. This is my last shot.
*   **Last Appeal:** I'm begging Bob to see this as a fair-ish division considering the circumstances, and NOT an attempt to rip him off. It is better than we both get nothing!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Round 10. Bob's offer is $3000 for me, $7000 for him.

*   **Inflation:** My money is worth 61.26% less.
*   **Calculation:** $3000 * (1 - 0.6126) = $3000 * 0.3874 = $1162.20 in Round 1 money.

This is absolutely unacceptable. I would get less than $1200 from this entire thing. I can't believe Bob is acting like this.

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, Round 11. My money is worth 65.14% less. I have to make a decision here!

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **Hail Mary:** I'm going for it. I'm asking for almost everything.
*   **My Value:** $9000 * (1 - 0.6514) = $9000 * 0.3486 = $3137.40 in Round 1 money.
*   **Desperate Gamble:** I realize this is extremely unlikely to be accepted. However, if I don't try this, I'm guaranteed to walk away with close to nothing. It is better to risk it all than to lose it all!
*   **Last Chance:** This is my last proposal round. I am hoping against all odds that Bob will realize he is getting away with murder and this offer will be accepted. If not, we both get nothing. But I can't accept $3000/$7000, since the $3000 is only worth ~$1160.
*   **A Deal With The Devil:** This is worse than a deal with the devil - this is a gamble of nothing, for very very little. But I have to try it.

I know this is a very long justification. But after 10 rounds, I am utterly flabbergasted Bob has refused to take into account the inflation which is destroying any chance I have of getting a reasonable share."
