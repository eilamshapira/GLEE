Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I propose a fair 50-50 split of the money, where we each get $5,000. This is an equitable division that gives us both equal value, and I believe it's the fairest way to proceed."

I understand that we both want to maximize our gains. Since we're now in round 4 and inflation is affecting your gains, I'm offering you $4,500 while I take $5,500. This recognizes the inflation pressure you're facing while still giving me a reasonable portion."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

I see that inflation is significantly affecting your gains. Given that we're in round 6 now and you're facing over 34% inflation on your portion, I'm offering you $4,000, which would have more relative value to you than it appears, while I take $6,000. This accounts for the inflation effects while moving us toward a resolution."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500}

I notice we're now in round 8 with inflation severely impacting your gains at nearly 47%. Since time is running out with only 4 rounds left, I'm offering you $3,500, which accounts for the inflation effect on your side, while I take $6,500. This should be more valuable to you now than a higher nominal amount in later rounds due to increasing inflation."

We're now in round 10 with only 2 rounds left after this. With inflation affecting your gains by almost 57%, I'm offering you $3,000, which, considering the inflation effect, would still provide significant value to you. I'll take $7,000. Given the limited rounds remaining and increasing inflation pressure, this offer balances our interests while acknowledging the time constraints we face."
