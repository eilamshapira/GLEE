Round 3

Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","Given the inflation, Alice's offer of 52 for me is actually worth 52 * (1 - 0.36) = 33.28 in real value from round 1.
Since the real value is less than 50, I will reject the offer.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given the inflation rate of 20% per round, the real value of the money for me is now 60% (1-0.4) of the original value.
Alice's inflation rate of 9.75% means she values the money at 90.25% (1-0.0975) of the original value.

I will offer a division that considers these differences in perceived value.

I am aware that with each passing round, the money is worth less for me, so I need to consider this in my offer. However, I also need to make an offer that Alice is likely to accept, given that she is also experiencing inflation but at a different rate."
