"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we both get a good share before inflation hits. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Equal split (5000$ each)
2. If I reject, in the next round:
   * The total value for me will be 9000$ (10% less)
   * The total value for Alice will be 8000$ (20% less)
   * I could propose a split that might get me more
3. However, there's risk in rejection:
   * Alice might reject my next offer
   * Further rounds mean more value loss
   * A 50-50 split is generally considered fair

Given that it's a fair offer and the risk of value loss through inflation, I'll accept.
