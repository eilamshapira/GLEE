4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, the depreciation makes each round crucial. By accepting this offer in round 2, you secure an immediate 20%‐discounted share of $4500—which is at least as good as what you’d expect if you waited to propose next round. I believe this is a fair and efficient split for both of us—let’s end the game now on a positive note!",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, it's my turn to propose and I'm aiming for a more balanced outcome.  Let's settle this now and avoid further losses due to inflation.",Alice,3,

4450.0,5550.0,"Alice, I know you’d prefer to propose next round, but if you wait until round 5 the overall pot shrinks further to an effective $4096. In the equilibrium of our alternating‐offer setup, as the next proposer you’d get roughly 55.6% of that—which is about an effective $2275. Offering you $4450 nominal now (worth about $2275 effective) makes you just as well off as if you waited. Let’s settle the division now to avoid further losses.",Bob,4,

5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, let's stop wasting time and split this evenly. A 50/50 split is the fairest and quickest way to end this.",Alice,5,
