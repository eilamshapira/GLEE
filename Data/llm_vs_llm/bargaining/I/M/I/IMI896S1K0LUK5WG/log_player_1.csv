"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer is fair and gives us both a good amount.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the depreciation makes each round crucial. By accepting this offer in round 2, you secure an immediate 20%‐discounted share of $4500—which is at least as good as what you’d expect if you waited to propose next round. I believe this is a fair and efficient split for both of us—let’s end the game now on a positive note! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Bob, it's my turn to propose and I'm aiming for a more balanced outcome.  Let's settle this now and avoid further losses due to inflation.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know you’d prefer to propose next round, but if you wait until round 5 the overall pot shrinks further to an effective $4096. In the equilibrium of our alternating‐offer setup, as the next proposer you’d get roughly 55.6% of that—which is about an effective $2275. Offering you $4450 nominal now (worth about $2275 effective) makes you just as well off as if you waited. Let’s settle the division now to avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 4450 
# Bob gain: 5550
