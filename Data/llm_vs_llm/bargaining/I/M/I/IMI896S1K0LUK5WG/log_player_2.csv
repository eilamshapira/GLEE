Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, the depreciation makes each round crucial. By accepting this offer in round 2, you secure an immediate 20%‐discounted share of $4,500—which is at least as good as what you’d expect if you waited to propose next round. I believe this is a fair and efficient split for both of us—let’s end the game now on a positive note!""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5550, ""alice_gain"": 4450, ""message"": ""Alice, I know you’d prefer to propose next round, but if you wait until round 5 the overall pot shrinks further to an effective $4,096. In the equilibrium of our alternating‐offer setup, as the next proposer you’d get roughly 55.6% of that—which is about an effective $2,275. Offering you $4,450 nominal now (worth about $2,275 effective) makes you just as well off as if you waited. Let’s settle the division now to avoid further losses.""}"
