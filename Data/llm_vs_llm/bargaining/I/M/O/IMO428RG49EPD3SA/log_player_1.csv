"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's calculate the value for me after inflation. Since the money is worth 20% less each round, my $5000 in this round is only worth $5000 * 0.8 = $4000 compared to the first round.

Given the inflation, and the fact that I have limited rounds, I need to be more careful about the gains. I'll accept this offer.
