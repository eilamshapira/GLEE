"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair on the surface. However, I need to account for the inflation factor.

If I reject this offer, I'll make the next proposal, but the total value will decrease - 5% less valuable for me and 10% less valuable for Alice. This means:
- If I reject, the $1,000,000 becomes worth $950,000 to me and $900,000 to Alice
- I could potentially propose a split that gives me more than $500,000, accounting for the reduced total value

Since Alice faces a steeper inflation penalty (10% vs my 5%), she may be more willing to accept a less equal split in the next round to avoid further depreciation.

Given these considerations, I'll reject this initial 50-50 offer to make a counter-proposal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer that accounts for the inflation factors while still being appealing to Alice. Since she faces a higher inflation rate (10% compared to my 5%), she has more incentive to accept this round rather than continuing to the next round.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing that I receive $550,000 and Alice receives $450,000. This is slightly in my favor compared to the initial 50-50 split, but still gives Alice a substantial portion. If she rejects this and we go to round 3, she'll face another 10% depreciation, which would significantly reduce the value of her potential gain. This offer represents a reasonable compromise considering our different inflation rates."
