"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer to divide the $1,000,000.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000}

I believe this is a fair starting offer. I'm offering Bob a substantial portion while keeping a reasonable amount for myself. Since Bob faces 20% inflation per round while I face no inflation, it's in his interest to accept a fair offer early rather than delay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","For round 3, I'll adjust my offer based on the inflation dynamics.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering a more balanced split that takes into account the fact that Bob faces 20% inflation per round. If we continue to the next round, Bob would face additional depreciation in value. This offer gives him a substantial portion while being fair to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","For round 5, I'll make a strategic adjustment to my offer considering the increasing inflation impact on Bob's side.

{""alice_gain"": 520000, 
""bob_gain"": 480000}

At this point, Bob has already lost nearly 50% of the value due to inflation. I'm offering him a larger portion than my previous offer to make it more attractive for him to accept now rather than continue and lose more value. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the inflation dynamics while still being reasonable for my interests."
