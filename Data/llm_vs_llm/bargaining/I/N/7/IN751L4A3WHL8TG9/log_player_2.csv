"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal for a quick and fair agreement: You receive $55 while I take $45. Accepting now helps both of us avoid the 10% inflation hit in future rounds (especially on my end), preserving more of the value for each of us. I believe this is a fair offer to settle the division in Round 1. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $55 while taking $45, which gives me more than half. This is a reasonable first offer, especially considering that inflation will reduce the value of the money by 20% each round if I reject. If I were to make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value would only be worth $80 to me.

Since I'm getting a majority share (55%) right from the start and avoiding the inflation penalty, this seems like a good deal.
