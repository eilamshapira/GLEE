600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because I face a 5% depreciation per round while you don't, so I need a larger share to achieve equal effective value.",Alice,1,

550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your position on the depreciation. How about a 55-45 split in your favor? It's closer to the middle ground while still acknowledging the depreciation factor.",Bob,2,

650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, let me explain why I need a 65-35 split. Due to two rounds of depreciation, my share is already worth 9.75% less than face value. This split would give me an effective $586625 (after depreciation) while you get $350000 at full value. This is actually quite fair given the circumstances.",Alice,3,
