Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position on the depreciation. How about a 55-45 split in your favor? It's closer to the middle ground while still acknowledging the depreciation factor. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Let me explain my reasoning: With 5% depreciation, if I accept now, my $550,000 is actually worth $522,500 (95% of the original value). Given that Bob faces no depreciation, and I still have more rounds to negotiate, I believe we can reach a better deal that better accounts for the depreciation I face."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Bob, let me explain why I need a 65-35 split. Due to two rounds of depreciation, my share is already worth 9.75% less than face value. This split would give me an effective $586,625 (after depreciation) while you get $350,000 at full value. This is actually quite fair given the circumstances.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see your point. Let's settle this - I accept your initial offer of a 60-40 split in your favor. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer now because if I wait longer, my share will continue to depreciate. At the current 14.26% depreciation, my $600,000 will be worth about $514,440, while Bob gets his $400,000 at full value. If I wait for another round, the depreciation will make any potential gains less valuable, so this is a reasonable compromise."
