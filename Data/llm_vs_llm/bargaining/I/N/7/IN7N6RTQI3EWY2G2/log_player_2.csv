"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because I face a 5% depreciation per round while you don't, so I need a larger share to achieve equal effective value. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 2

 ""alice_gain"": 550000,
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your position on the depreciation. How about a 55-45 split in your favor? It's closer to the middle ground while still acknowledging the depreciation factor.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let me explain why I need a 65-35 split. Due to two rounds of depreciation, my share is already worth 9.75% less than face value. This split would give me an effective $586625 (after depreciation) while you get $350000 at full value. This is actually quite fair given the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
