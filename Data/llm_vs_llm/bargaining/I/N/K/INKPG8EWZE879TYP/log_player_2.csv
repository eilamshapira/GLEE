Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle of our previous offers 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is slightly better than her first, but I believe I can still negotiate a better outcome.  Each round that passes gives me more leverage, as the inflation will continue to impact my potential gains."

While the decreasing value due to inflation is concerning, I'm holding out for a slightly better split. Alice is clearly feeling the pressure too, and her offer is getting closer to my desired range."
