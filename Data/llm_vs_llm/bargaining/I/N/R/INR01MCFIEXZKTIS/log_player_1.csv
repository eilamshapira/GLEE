"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you can still make a very good profit.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think a 55-45 split is more reasonable, considering we both want to reach an agreement and the potential loss due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
- If I accept now, I'll get $450,000, but with 20% inflation, that's worth $360,000 to me
- If I reject, we go to the next round where I can make an offer, but there will be even more inflation
- Bob seems willing to negotiate reasonably, but they're asking for more than I offered
- The inflation rate affects me more severely than Bob (20% vs 5%)
- We still have 10 rounds left, but the value keeps decreasing

Given that my inflation rate is much higher than Bob's, and that the offer is not terrible (I still get a significant amount), I should probably accept rather than risk further value loss.
