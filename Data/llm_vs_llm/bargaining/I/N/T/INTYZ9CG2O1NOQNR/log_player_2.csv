"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically. 

If I accept:
- I get $40 immediately
- The game ends

If I reject:
- The $100 total becomes worth $95 (5% less)
- I get to make the next offer
- Alice could still reject my offer, leading to further devaluation

$40 is a bit low considering it's a $100 split. I believe I can propose a more equitable split in the next round, even accounting for the 5% inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a more balanced split, but keeping in mind that if Alice rejects, the total will decrease by another 5%.

I'll offer a 55-45 split in my favor, which is fairer than the previous 60-40 split while still giving me a slight advantage as compensation for the 5% we've already lost.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

Let me explain my offer to Alice: ""I propose a more balanced split that gives both of us a fair share. This is more equitable than the previous offer."""
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The money is now worth 9.75% less, so if I accept:
   - I get $45, but it's actually worth around $40.61 in original value
   - This is slightly better than Alice's first offer in real terms

2. If I reject:
   - The next round will have another 5% inflation (total ~15% from original)
   - I might get a better split, but it will be worth even less
   - There's no guarantee Alice will accept my next offer

3. Alice has moved from her original 60-40 split to a more reasonable 55-45 split
   - This shows willingness to compromise
   - Further negotiation might not yield significantly better results

Given the increasing inflation and the improved offer, I think it's wise to accept now rather than risk further devaluation.
