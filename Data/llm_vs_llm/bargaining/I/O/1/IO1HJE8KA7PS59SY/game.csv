5000.0,5000.0,"I'm proposing an equal split of $5000 each. This is completely fair, and if we keep delaying, we'll both lose money due to the 10% inflation per round. Let's make a fair deal now and both walk away happy.",Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, I understand your point about inflation, but I believe I should get a bit more. Let's settle with $5500 for me and $4500 for you. This is still a good deal for you, and we can both walk away with a fair amount.",Bob,2,

5100.0,4900.0,"Bob, I understand your desire for more, but remember, the money is now worth 20% less than when we started. I'm offering you $4900 which is very generous. If we continue to the next round, we'll lose another 10% to inflation. Let's reach an agreement now - I'll take $5100 and you get $4900. This is better for you than continuing to negotiate with more inflation.",Alice,3,
