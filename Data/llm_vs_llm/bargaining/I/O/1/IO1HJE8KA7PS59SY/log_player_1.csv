"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob that I think is fair and beneficial for both of us.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your point about inflation, but I believe I should get a bit more. Let's settle with $5500 for me and $4500 for you. This is still a good deal for you, and we can both walk away with a fair amount. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5100,
""bob_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire for more, but remember, the money is now worth 20% less than when we started. I'm offering you $4900 which is very generous. If we continue to the next round, we'll lose another 10% to inflation. Let's reach an agreement now - I'll take $5100 and you get $4900. This is better for you than continuing to negotiate with more inflation.""}"
