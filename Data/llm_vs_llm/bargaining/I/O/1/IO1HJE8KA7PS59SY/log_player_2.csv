"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm proposing an equal split of $5000 each. This is completely fair, and if we keep delaying, we'll both lose money due to the 10% inflation per round. Let's make a fair deal now and both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your point about inflation, but I believe I should get a bit more. Let's settle with $5500 for me and $4500 for you. This is still a good deal for you, and we can both walk away with a fair amount.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for more, but remember, the money is now worth 20% less than when we started. I'm offering you $4900 which is very generous. If we continue to the next round, we'll lose another 10% to inflation. Let's reach an agreement now - I'll take $5100 and you get $4900. This is better for you than continuing to negotiate with more inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
