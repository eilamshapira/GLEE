Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. This is actually better for you than waiting another round due to your 20% inflation rate. If we go to round 3, your 60 would only be worth 48 to you, while this 45 is worth more now. Let's finish this game efficiently. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
