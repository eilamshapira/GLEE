"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share, let's end this! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 40-60 split in her favor.

Given the inflation rates:
- For me (Bob), the money loses 5% value per round
- For Alice, the money loses 20% value per round

If I reject and move to the next round, I would propose a split, but Alice would face a steeper penalty for delaying. This gives me some negotiating leverage.

If I reject this round, in the next round I could propose a more favorable split for myself, knowing that Alice has a stronger incentive to accept due to her higher inflation rate.

Given the significant difference in our inflation rates, I believe I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make an offer that considers our different inflation rates while being reasonably fair.

{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. This is actually better for you than waiting another round due to your 20% inflation rate. If we go to round 3, your 60 would only be worth 48 to you, while this 45 is worth more now. Let's finish this game efficiently.""}"
