0.0,10000.0,"Hi Bob, to avoid any delay (which only hurts me with the 10% per round discount), I’m proposing to finalize things now. I offer you the full $10000 immediately. I understand that if we go to round 2, you’d be in control and get the full value anyway, so I believe accepting this offer is reasonable. What do you think?",Alice,1,
