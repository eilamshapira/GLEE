5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Bob! Since we both face different inflation rates, I'm proposing an equal split of $5000 each. For you, waiting means your share loses 20% value each round, while my money doesn't devalue. A fair 50-50 split now seems optimal for both of us.",Alice,1,

4000.0,6000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but considering the 20% inflation rate affecting my share each round, I need to propose a split of $6000 for me and $4000 for you. This adjustment accounts for the value I'm losing with each passing round. I hope you understand and can accept this offer.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, I understand your concern about inflation, but we need to be fair to both parties. Consider that your $6000 in round 2 is actually only worth $4800 to you now in round 3 due to your 20% inflation. My offer of $4500 now is actually worth more to you than waiting another round. If we reach round 4, your money loses even more value. This is a reasonable compromise that recognizes your inflation concerns while being fair to me as well.",Alice,3,

3000.0,7000.0,"Alice, I understand your perspective, but the inflation rate severely impacts my share each round. With my money now worth 51.2% less than in round 1, I need to propose $7000 for myself and $3000 for you. This offer reflects the urgent need to settle before my share loses even more value. I hope you can see the fairness in this given the circumstances.",Bob,4,

6000.0,4000.0,"Bob, we need to reach an agreement. Due to inflation, your share has already lost significant value - at this point, any money you get is worth only about 40% of its original value due to the compounding 20% inflation. My offer of $4000 to you now is actually worth more to you than waiting for another round and getting even $7000, which would be worth only $2240 in round 1 value. This is my final reasonable offer that acknowledges your inflation problem while still being fair to me. Let's end this negotiation now before you lose even more value.",Alice,5,
