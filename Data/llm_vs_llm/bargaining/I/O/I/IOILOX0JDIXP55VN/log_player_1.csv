Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is simply a repeat of Bob's previous offer but with the amounts reversed in his favor.  I'm hoping he's willing to negotiate a fairer deal, especially as the stakes are getting higher with each round due to inflation."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're running out of time, and the money's value is dropping fast. I think 60-40 is a fair split now. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is cutting it close, and not ideal, but if we keep going, the value will drop even more.  It's better to secure something than risk ending up with nothing."
