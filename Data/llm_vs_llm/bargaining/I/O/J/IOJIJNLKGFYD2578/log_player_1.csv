I propose to take 990,000$ and give Bob 10,000$.  I believe this is a fair starting point, as it demonstrates a willingness to share while ensuring a significant portion for myself."

# Bob gain: 450000

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm reducing my share slightly to 900,000, but still offering a significant portion to Bob at 100,000. This is a good compromise given the inflation factor, and I believe it's in both our interests to reach an agreement before further rounds reduce the value of the money."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This time, I'm offering Bob 150,000, which is a more generous offer than the previous round.  However, with the inflation affecting my earnings significantly, I need to ensure I receive a fair share as well."

Round 7

I'm willing to compromise further and offer Bob 200,000.  The inflation is hitting us both hard, but I still believe we can reach a fair agreement before the value of the money diminishes even further."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

Given the increasing inflation, I'm offering Bob 250,000, which is a significant amount considering the decreasing value.  We both need to find a solution that allows us to share the remaining value while it's still worth something."
