"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

$40 is not a terrible offer, but it's less than half of the total amount. Since there's no inflation penalty for me in future rounds, I can safely reject this and make a counter-offer in the next round. I might be able to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a more balanced split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the offer.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

This offer gives Alice a fair portion while securing a reasonable advantage for myself. It's more equitable than her initial offer and should be acceptable to her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is offering me $45
2. She's taking $55, but it's worth 36% less to her due to inflation (effectively worth about $35.2 to her)
3. My gains aren't affected by inflation
4. If I reject, we'll go to another round where I can make an offer, but Alice's inflation will be even worse

Given that:
- This is a better offer than her first one ($45 vs $40)
- Alice is already suffering from significant inflation
- I'm getting a reasonable amount
- Further negotiations might lead to a breakdown in talks

I'll accept this offer.
