"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since any money you receive is now worth 20% less to you due to inflation, this 40$ is equivalent to 32$ for you. If you reject and we continue to the next round, your share will be worth even less. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less in each round, and this is the 3rd round, the money I receive will be worth approximately 64% of its original value (100% * 0.8 * 0.8). Considering this, I'll make a new offer.

{""alice_gain"": 45, 
""bob_gain"": 55, 
""message"": ""I'm taking into account the inflation effect on my share. This offer is more reasonable considering the decreasing value of my potential gain.""}"
