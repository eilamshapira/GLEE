"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Since inflation affects Alice's gains by 20% each round but doesn't affect mine, I actually have an advantage in waiting. If Alice gets 50$ now, that's her best possible outcome. If we wait one round, her maximum gain would be worth 20% less to her.

I can likely get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round, knowing that Alice will be more inclined to accept due to the inflation penalty she faces.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice faces a 20% inflation penalty per round, and this is round 2, any money she gets now is worth 80% of its original value to her. I can use this to negotiate a better deal for myself while still making it attractive for her to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Since any money you receive is now worth 20% less to you due to inflation, this 40$ is equivalent to 32$ for you. If you reject and we continue to the next round, your share will be worth even less. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm taking into account the inflation effect on my share. This offer is more reasonable considering the decreasing value of my potential gain. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this. Alice is offering me 55$ and taking 45$ for herself. Due to the 36% inflation she faces in this round, her 45$ is actually worth only about 28.8$ to her (45 * 0.64). 

I could reject and make a counter-offer next round, where her share would be worth even less to her (44% less than original value). This would likely allow me to negotiate an even better deal. However, we also need to consider that we only have 12 rounds total, and if we don't reach an agreement, we both get nothing.

Given that I've already improved my position from the initial 50-50 split to getting 55$, and considering the risk of prolonging negotiations too long, I think this is a reasonable offer to accept.
