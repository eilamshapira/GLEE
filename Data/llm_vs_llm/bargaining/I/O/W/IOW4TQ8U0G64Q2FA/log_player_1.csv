"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an initial offer to Bob that's balanced but slightly in my favor, along with a friendly message.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm suggesting a fair split that's close to 50/50. This way we both walk away with a substantial amount rather than risking further rounds where we might both lose out.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since you proposed a near 50/50 split last round, I think it's fair to switch our positions this time. Let's see if you agree to 5500 for me and 4500 for you. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
