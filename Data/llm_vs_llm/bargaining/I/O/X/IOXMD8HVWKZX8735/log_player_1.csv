"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to factor in the inflation.

The original $1,000,000 is now worth 20% less to me.

My current value is 1,000,000 * (1 - 0.20) = $800,000.

Bob is offering me $400,000.

My decision is:

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
