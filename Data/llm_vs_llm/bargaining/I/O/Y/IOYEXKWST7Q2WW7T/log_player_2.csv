"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each round, I'll make a more favorable offer to myself to compensate for the loss. 

{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value I'd get from Alice's offer is 4800 * 0.64 (since 20% less in round 1 and another 20% less in round 2, combined is 36% less) = 3072.

And for Alice, the value she'd get is 5200 * 0.9025 = 4693.

Given this, I think I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 20% * 3 = 60% less for me (or 40% of the original value) and 5% * 3 = 15% less (or 85% of the original value) for Alice, compounded, so it is: 
for me 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.512 and 
for Alice 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.857375.

I'll make an offer that takes this into account.
