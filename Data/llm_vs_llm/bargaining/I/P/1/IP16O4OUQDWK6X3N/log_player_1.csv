"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","To start the game, I'll make a reasonable offer. Since the money decreases in value over rounds, it's beneficial to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. Considering the inflation rates, I'll propose a division that slightly favors me to account for the higher inflation rate I'm subject to, but still keeps the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider accepting.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's settle early to maximize value.""
}
```

This offer gives me $550,000 and Bob $450,000, aiming to find a middle ground that acknowledges the different inflation rates we're both facing. The message encourages Bob to accept the offer to avoid further devaluation of the money."
