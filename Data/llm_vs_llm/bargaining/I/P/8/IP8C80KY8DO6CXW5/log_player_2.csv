"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Even though the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, accepting a 1/99 split is incredibly unfair. There's a slight chance Alice might be desperate enough to offer a better deal in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2 
# Alice gain: 98 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is still a terrible deal, but the value of holding out is diminishing rapidly with each round.  It's highly unlikely Alice will offer anything better, and I need to salvage something before the money becomes practically worthless."
