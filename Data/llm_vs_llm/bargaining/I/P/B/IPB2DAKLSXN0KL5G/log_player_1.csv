"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my offer to divide $10,000 with Bob in Round 1.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose an equal split of the money. This is fair for both of us to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500}

Given the inflation rates, I'm proposing a slight adjustment in my favor since Bob faces steeper inflation (20% per round versus my 5% per round). This division still gives Bob a substantial portion while accounting for our different inflation pressures."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'd like to propose a 60/40 split. With the inflation rates (my 5% vs your 20% per round), this division better accounts for the rapidly decreasing value for you. By round 5, your inflation has reached nearly 50% while mine is only around 15%. This offer aims to reach a fair agreement considering these differences."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 5000
