"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer gives Alice a significantly larger share. Since I can make a counter-offer in the next round, I'll reject this uneven split and propose a fairer distribution."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I propose an equal split of the $100, which is the fairest outcome for both parties."
