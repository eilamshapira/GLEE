Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 52.5-47.5 split in my favor. This is more balanced than your initial offer, and since inflation affects me but not you, accepting now would benefit us both rather than continuing negotiations. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
