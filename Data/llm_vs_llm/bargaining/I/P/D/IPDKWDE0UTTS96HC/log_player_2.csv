"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40 in my favor. It's a fair start considering the inflation affects you more. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation. That means the $1M would effectively be worth $950K from my perspective.

Alice's current offer gives me $400K. If I wait one round, even getting a 50-50 split would give me $475K (half of $950K), which is better than the current offer. I could potentially negotiate for even more.

Since there's room for a better deal even accounting for inflation, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I should propose something that's better for me while still being reasonable enough for Alice to accept. Given that further delays will hurt me more due to inflation, I need to make this offer compelling.

{""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""I propose a 52.5-47.5 split in my favor. This is more balanced than your initial offer, and since inflation affects me but not you, accepting now would benefit us both rather than continuing negotiations.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: How about a 55-45 split in my favor? This takes into account the inflation affecting you and provides a more balanced division. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

The $450K offered to me is now worth only $406,125 (due to 9.75% inflation).

If I reject and we go to the next round:
- I'll face 14.5% inflation (another 5% compound)
- Even if I got a 50-50 split then, $500K would be worth only $427,500 to me
- And there's no guarantee Alice would accept a 50-50 split

Alice's current offer ($406,125 real value to me) is not that far off from what I could reasonably expect to get in the next round, and continuing negotiations puts me at risk of further value loss due to inflation.

Given the inflation pressure and the risk of further deterioration, I should accept this offer.
