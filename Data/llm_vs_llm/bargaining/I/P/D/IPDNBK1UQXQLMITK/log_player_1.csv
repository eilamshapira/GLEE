"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, I need to consider that when evaluating the offer. The $5500 offered to me is actually worth $5500 * 0.9 = $4950 to me.

Considering this, I think the offer is not in my favor.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Due to inflation, the money I gain is now worth 20% less than in the first round (10% less in round 2 and another 10% less in round 3). 

To calculate the offer, I'll consider the reduced value. If I offer myself $6000, it's actually worth $6000 * 0.8 = $4800 to me.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 30% less in two rounds (10% + 10% + 10% = 30%)  but actually 27.1% less in 3 rounds (10% + 10% + 7.1% = 27.1%)  than in the first round, I need to consider that when evaluating the offer. The $7000 offered to me is actually worth $7000 * 0.729 = $5103 to me.

Considering this, I think the offer is more in my favor compared to the previous rounds.
