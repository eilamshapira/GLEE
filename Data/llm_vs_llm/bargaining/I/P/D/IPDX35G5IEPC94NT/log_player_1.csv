"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it equally. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage and we can both walk away with a fair share. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The reasoning: While I initially tried for a 60-40 split, Bob's offer of a 50-50 split is fair, and importantly, accepting now means I avoid further inflation losses. With 5% inflation per round, waiting longer would only decrease the real value of my share. Even though I get $50 instead of $60, the 50-50 split is reasonable, and the inflation effect makes it worth accepting now rather than risking further negotiations."
