"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split it 60-40 in my favor. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice offers me $40 out of $100
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 20% inflation, the money will be worth less to me next round
4. $40 now is better than $50 in the next round (which would be worth $40 after inflation)
5. This is a reasonable first offer, considering the inflation penalty
