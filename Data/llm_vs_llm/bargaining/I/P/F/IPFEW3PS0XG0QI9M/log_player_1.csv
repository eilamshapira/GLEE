"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a fair 60-40 split considering the inflation rates. You lose value faster than me, so it's in your interest to accept early.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while you're right about inflation, a 60-40 split was too extreme. This 55-45 split is fairer considering we both lose value over time. It's better for both of us to reach an agreement early. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. My potential gain of $45 is now worth 5% less (â‰ˆ$42.75)
2. If I reject and propose in the next round, any amount will be worth even less
3. Bob made a reasonable point about reaching an agreement early
4. The split is not too unfavorable, and the inflation penalty will only get worse
