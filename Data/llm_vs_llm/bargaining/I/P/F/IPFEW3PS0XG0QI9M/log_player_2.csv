"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a fair 60-40 split considering the inflation rates. You lose value faster than me, so it's in your interest to accept early. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:
1. Alice is right about inflation affecting me more (10% vs her 5%)
2. However, 60-40 split heavily favors her
3. In the next round, I can propose a better split for myself
4. My money will be worth 90% in the next round, but I should be able to get more than 40%

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split considering the inflation rates:

{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Alice, while you're right about inflation, a 60-40 split was too extreme. This 55-45 split is fairer considering we both lose value over time. It's better for both of us to reach an agreement early.""}"
