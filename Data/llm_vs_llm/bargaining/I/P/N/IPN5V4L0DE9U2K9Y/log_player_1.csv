"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll play as Alice and make an offer in this first round. I need to consider the fact that with each passing round, the money is worth 20% less to me due to inflation, so there's an incentive to reach an agreement sooner rather than later.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I think a 50-50 split is fair and provides us both with a reasonable outcome. This even division respects both our interests and avoids prolonging negotiations, which would reduce the value for me due to inflation."
