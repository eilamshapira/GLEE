"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I propose we split it 60-40 in my favor. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100
2. If I reject, we go to next round where I can make an offer
3. However, due to 20% inflation, in the next round the money will be worth less to me
4. $40 now is better than $50 in next round after 20% inflation ($50 * 0.8 = $40)
5. This is actually a fair enough offer considering the inflation penalty
