"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I need to consider that when evaluating the offer. 

To calculate the value of the offer, I'll multiply the amount by 0.95 (1 - 0.05 inflation).

The value of Bob's offer to me is: 40 * 0.95 = 38

Considering this, I think I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less with each round, and this is the third round, I'll calculate the value as follows:

Round 1: 100%
Round 2: 95% (1 - 0.05)
Round 3: 95% * 0.95 = 90.25% (or 1 - 0.05, then multiply by 0.95 again)

To maximize my gain, I'll offer Bob a smaller amount.
