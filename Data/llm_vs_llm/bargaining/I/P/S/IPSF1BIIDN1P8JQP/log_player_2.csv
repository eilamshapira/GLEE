"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a slightly higher amount for myself because I face 20% inflation per round while you don't. This is a fair offer that gives us both substantial value right away without risking any loss from delays. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the rules. I'm playing as Bob, and the money doesn't lose value for me, while it loses 20% value for Alice each round.

Alice is offering me $450,000 and keeping $550,000 for herself.

I need to decide whether to accept this offer or reject it and move to the next round where I make the offer.

Considering the initial offer:
*   **Bob:** $450,000
*   **Alice:** $550,000

Since I don't lose money to inflation, accepting gives me $450,000 *now*. If I reject, I have to make a counter offer, and there is no guarantee that Alice will accept, especially since she is losing money at 20% per round. Also, if Alice rejects my next offer, she will make the next offer, which is losing even more money.

Therefore, the best option is to accept.
