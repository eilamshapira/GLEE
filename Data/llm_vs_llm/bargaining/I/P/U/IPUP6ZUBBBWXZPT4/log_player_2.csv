"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's proposal gives me $4,000 while she takes $6,000. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value will decrease by 5% for me (down to $9,500 equivalent value). I should consider whether I can likely get more than $4,000 in the next round, accounting for this inflation.

Given that Alice isn't affected by inflation, she has a stronger negotiating position as rounds progress. Still, her current offer gives me only 40% of the total, which seems somewhat low.

I'll reject this offer to propose a more favorable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to make a reasonable counter-offer that accounts for the 5% inflation penalty I face. A more equitable division would give me a larger share, while still being attractive enough for Alice to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I propose a 50-50 split, which is fair and equitable. This gives each of us $5,000. If Alice rejects, she'll make the next offer, but I'll face another 5% inflation penalty. I believe this even split respects both our interests and is a reasonable improvement over the previous 40-60 split."
