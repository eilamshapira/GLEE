Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:** The value of the money is decreasing. While I don't know how Bob values the money after inflation, it's in my best interest to secure a reasonable amount sooner rather than later.
* **Previous Offer:** Bob rejecting my initial offer and countering with a heavily skewed offer in his favor suggests he might be aiming for a larger share.
* **Compromise:** This offer is a compromise between my initial proposal and Bob's offer. It shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a slightly advantageous outcome for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice due to the following:

* **Significant Inflation:** The value of the money has decreased substantially for both of us. Waiting any longer will only result in a smaller overall reward, even if I could secure a slightly larger share in a later round. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  The potential gains from continuing to negotiate are outweighed by the losses incurred from inflation with each passing round. 
* **Uncertain Future Offers:** There's no guarantee that Bob would offer a more favorable deal in subsequent rounds. He might become even more insistent on the 55/45 split, especially as the value decreases. 

This situation highlights the classic negotiation challenge of balancing potential future gains against the certainty of a present offer, all under the pressure of external factors (inflation)."
