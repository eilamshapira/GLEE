"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I want to make a fair offer that considers the inflation impact on Bob's side.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. Since Bob's money loses 5% value each round, this gives him an incentive to accept now rather than continuing to negotiate, while still giving him a substantial portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll adjust my offer to be more appealing to Bob while still considering the inflation effect.

{""alice_gain"": 535000, ""bob_gain"": 465000}

I'm proposing a 53.5/46.5 split. Given that Bob faces 5% inflation per round, it would be rational for him to accept this now rather than continue negotiating, as his share would be worth less in future rounds. This is a better offer for Bob than my initial proposal while still reflecting the asymmetric inflation pressure."
