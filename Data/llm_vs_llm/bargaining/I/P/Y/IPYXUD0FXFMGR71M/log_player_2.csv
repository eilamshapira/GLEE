"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $400,000 while she gets $600,000. If I reject and move to round 2, I can make my own proposal, but the total value will be reduced by 20% due to inflation (for me). This means the total would effectively be worth $800,000 to me in the next round.

If I reject now and propose a 50-50 split in round 2, I could potentially get $500,000 Ã— 0.8 = $400,000, which is the same as Alice's current offer. However, Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation for me.

Given that my potential gain in round 2 wouldn't clearly exceed what I'm being offered now, and there's risk of further inflation if negotiations continue, I'll accept Alice's offer.
