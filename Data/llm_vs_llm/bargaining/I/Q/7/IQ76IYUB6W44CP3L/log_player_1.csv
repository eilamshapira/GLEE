"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my first offer to Bob, considering the inflation rates that affect both of us over the rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I believe this is a fair first offer that slightly favors me but gives Bob a substantial portion. Given that Bob faces higher inflation (10% per round) compared to my 5%, he has more incentive to accept earlier, but I'm still offering him a meaningful share to make early agreement attractive."
