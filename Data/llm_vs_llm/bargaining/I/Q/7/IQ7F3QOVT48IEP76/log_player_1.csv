"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to propose a division of $10,000 to Bob, keeping in mind the decreasing value of the money for both of us with each passing round. Since this is Round 1, the inflation isn't too bad yet. I want to make an offer that is generous enough for Bob to accept it, but still leaves me with a significant portion.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, hoping he'll see it as a good deal in the early rounds. I am keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob rejected my offer and has now proposed a 50/50 split of $5,000 each. I need to consider the inflation. For me, the money is worth 10% less than in Round 1.

If I accept, I get $5,000 which is worth $5,000 * 0.9 = $4,500 in Round 1 money.

I think this is a reasonable offer, and rejecting it would mean further losses due to inflation.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
