"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is proposing an equal 50-50 split
2. It's the first round, so no inflation has occurred yet
3. The offer is fair and reasonable
4. If I reject, I would make the next offer, but Alice could reject and the money might be worth less in future rounds
5. There's no guarantee I could get a better deal in subsequent rounds
