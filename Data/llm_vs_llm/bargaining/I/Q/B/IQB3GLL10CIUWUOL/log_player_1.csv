Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the amount equally at 50-50. This way, we both start off equally and fairly. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The equal split seems fair at first glance, but due to the asymmetric inflation rates, I should propose a better deal for both of us. Since Bob's inflation rate (20%) is much higher than mine (5%), it's in his interest to reach an agreement sooner rather than later."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""I'm offering a 55-45 split, which is more favorable to you than my first offer. Remember, with your 20% inflation rate per round, delaying will cost you much more than it costs me. This is a fair deal that benefits us both if we agree now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I am willing to adjust slightly, proposing a 42-58 split in your favor. This maintains fairness while accounting for the inflation impact on me. 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. The 58-42 split in my favor is reasonable, and considering the mounting inflation effects (my money is already worth 14.26% less and Bob's is worth 48.8% less), continuing to negotiate would significantly reduce the real value for both of us. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both the inflation rates and the need for a timely agreement."
