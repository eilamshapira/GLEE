"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it evenly, no need to wait 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which would give me $500,000. Since there's no inflation affecting my portion in future rounds, I don't lose anything by continuing. However, this is a fair offer, and there's no guarantee I could get a better deal in the next round. Alice might reject a more aggressive proposal from me.
