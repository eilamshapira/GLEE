5556.0,4444.0,"Hi Bob, I propose that I take $5556 and you get $4444. Considering that each round depresses the total value by 20%, accepting this offer now ensures you get a fair, time‚Äêdiscounted share rather than risking further loss with additional rounds. I believe this is a fair and efficient split for both of us.",Alice,1,
