"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I take $5556 and you get $4444. Considering that each round depresses the total value by 20%, accepting this offer now ensures you get a fair, time‚Äêdiscounted share rather than risking further loss with additional rounds. I believe this is a fair and efficient split for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4444 
# Alice gain: 5556 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine if this is a fair offer, let's consider the total value of the money after the first round and the split Alice is proposing.

Initially, the total amount is $10,000. Since the value decreases by 20% each round, after the first round, the value becomes 80% of $10,000, which is $8,000.

Alice proposes a split where she gets $5,556 and I get $4,444. This split is based on the original $10,000, not the depreciated value after the first round. Considering the depreciated value of $8,000 after the first round, if we were to split it evenly, each of us would get $4,000. However, Alice's proposal gives me $4,444, which is more than half of the depreciated $8,000.

Given that the offer is slightly in my favor compared to an even split of the depreciated amount and considering the risk of further value decrease in subsequent rounds, I decide to accept this offer to avoid potential further loss.
