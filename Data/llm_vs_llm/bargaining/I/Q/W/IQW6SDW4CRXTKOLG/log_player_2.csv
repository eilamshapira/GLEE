"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I keep $3448.28 and you get $6551.72. This offer reflects the fact that waiting hurts both of us, especially me with a 10% discount versus your 5%. Accepting now avoids further losses for both sides and is fair given our future bargaining positions. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 6551.72 
# Alice gain: 3448.28 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
