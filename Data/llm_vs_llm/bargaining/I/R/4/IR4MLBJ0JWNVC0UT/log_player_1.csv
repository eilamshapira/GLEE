I'm starting with a very high offer for myself, knowing Bob's money will depreciate faster than mine. I'm hoping he'll accept it to avoid losing even more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still aiming for a large share.  Since Bob's money is depreciating quickly, I'm hoping he'll accept this offer before it becomes even less valuable to him."
