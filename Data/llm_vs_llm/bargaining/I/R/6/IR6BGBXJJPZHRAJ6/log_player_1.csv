Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"":800000,""bob_gain"":200000,""message"":""I believe this is a fair division. Let's secure our gains!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose an equal 50/50 split, which is fair to both of us. Since I face 20% inflation each round, delaying further would hurt me significantly, but this division ensures we both walk away with substantial value. A balanced approach benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
