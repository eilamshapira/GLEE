"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I believe this is a fair division. Let's secure our gains! 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's offering me $200,000 while taking $800,000 for herself, which is an 80/20 split in her favor. 

If I reject and we move to the next round, I'll face 20% inflation, meaning my future gains will be worth less. However, I'll have the opportunity to make a counter-offer that could be more favorable to me.

Given the significant disparity in this division and that I'll have the opportunity to propose next, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer while acknowledging the inflation pressure on my side.

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""I propose an equal 50/50 split, which is fair to both of us. Since I face 20% inflation each round, delaying further would hurt me significantly, but this division ensures we both walk away with substantial value. A balanced approach benefits us both.""}"
