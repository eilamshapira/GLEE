"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob – based on a backwards‐induction analysis considering that with 12 rounds and a 5% per round discount you’re scheduled to wield considerable bargaining power in later rounds, I propose the following division on round 1: I receive $2357.62 and you receive $7642.38. This offer gives you exactly what you could expect to earn by waiting, while I try to salvage as much value as possible. I believe this is the rational, fair proposal given our future opportunities. Accept, and we both secure our earnings before further discounting kicks in! 
# Bob gain: 7642.38 
# Alice gain: 2357.62 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
