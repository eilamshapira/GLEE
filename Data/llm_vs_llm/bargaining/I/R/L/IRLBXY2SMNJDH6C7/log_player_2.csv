Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a larger share to account for the inflation we're both facing. This is my compromise. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Alice is offering to meet halfway, the inflation is cutting into potential gains significantly.  It's worth risking another round to see if I can secure a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking, and inflation is eating away at our potential gains. Let's be reasonable. I'm offering you a significant portion, but I need a bit extra to compensate for the risk I'm taking with inflation.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but the inflation is hitting me hard. This is a slight bump from your last offer, but I need to secure a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is cutting it close, but with the inflation at nearly 60%, it's no longer worth the risk. Accepting this offer secures me a reasonable amount considering the circumstances."
