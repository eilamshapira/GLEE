Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's cut to the chase. I propose I receive $800,000 and you $200,000 todayâ€”this way we both secure a significant sum before further rounds (and inflation) diminish our shares. Looking forward to a quick, fair resolution!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the impact of inflation, I propose a split of $600000 for me and $400000 for you. This way, we both get a fair share before the value decreases further. Let's settle this round! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
