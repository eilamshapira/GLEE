"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Split it evenly, no need to gamble""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: How about I get a bit more, since I'm willing to risk going further? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept this offer, I'll get $400,000, but its value will be 20% less than its original value. So, the actual value I'll get is $400,000 * 0.8 = $320,000.

I think I can do better than that. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each round, and this is the 3rd round, the value of the money I'll receive will be 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 of its original value.

To make it fair, I'll take into account the inflation. I'll offer Bob a bit less than before, considering he's willing to risk going further.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Don't gamble too much, let's be reasonable""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle. I think this is fair given the inflation impact on you. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value I'll get if I accept this offer. Since the money is worth 48.8% less for me, I'll multiply $450,000 by (1 - 0.488) = 0.512.

So, the actual value I'll get is $450,000 * 0.512 = $230,400.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is not that bad, given the inflation impact on me. Meeting in the middle sounds reasonable.
