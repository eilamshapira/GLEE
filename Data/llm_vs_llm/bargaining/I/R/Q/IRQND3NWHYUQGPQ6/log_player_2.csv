Let's see if Alice can do better in the next round. Since there's no inflation affecting me, I can take a small risk."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000,

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Don't gamble too much, let's be reasonable 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is lower than my previous offer, and I still have plenty of rounds left to negotiate. Let's see if she can do better in the next round, especially since inflation is affecting her gains."
