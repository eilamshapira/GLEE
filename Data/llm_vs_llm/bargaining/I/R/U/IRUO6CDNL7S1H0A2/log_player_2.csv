"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that Alice is offering me $40 out of $100, I need to consider the inflation effect. If I reject, next round I can make a counter-offer, but the total amount will be worth 20% less to me. This means the $100 would effectively be worth $80 to me in the next round.

If I accepted now, I get $40. If I reject and counter-offer in the next round, even if I proposed a more favorable split (say $60 for me, $40 for Alice), my $60 would be worth $48 after inflation (20% less). Since Alice might also reject my counter-offer, leading to further inflation in subsequent rounds, accepting $40 now might be more prudent than risking further devaluation.
