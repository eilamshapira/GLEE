"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7143, ""bob_gain"": 2857, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $7,143 and you receive $2,857. Given the fact that each round’s delay incurs a 10% devaluation for me and a 20% devaluation for you, this division is designed to make you just as well off accepting now as you would be if you waited to counteroffer. I believe this is the fair equilibrium split for round one—looking forward to your response!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. Considering the devaluation aspect, I propose that I receive $4000 and you get $6000. This ensures both of us get a meaningful share without losing too much value over time. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement quickly to maximize our benefits! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. However, I believe that by continuing the negotiation and having the opportunity to propose a division in the next round, I can secure a more favorable share given our respective discount rates. Let's proceed to round 3 and keep working toward a division that reflects our future values.""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7143, ""bob_gain"": 2857, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, in round 3 I propose the same fair equilibrium split we derived earlier: I receive $7,143 and you receive $2,857 in nominal dollars. Given that in this round my money is discounted by 0.9² (0.81) and yours by 0.8² (0.64), this division is calculated so that you get roughly what you would expect if you waited to propose in round 4. Accepting now maximizes our effective earnings and helps us avoid further losses from devaluation. I look forward to your response!""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your reasoning, but to find a fair compromise, I propose $3600 for me and $6400 for you this round. This way, we both lessen the effects of inflation and get a satisfying share. Let's finalize this before more value is lost!

# Bob gain: 3600

Given that further rounds will only reduce the value for both of us—even more so for you—I believe it’s in our best interest to avoid additional devaluation.
