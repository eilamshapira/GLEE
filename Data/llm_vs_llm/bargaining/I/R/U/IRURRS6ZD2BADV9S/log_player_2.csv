"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $7143 and you receive $2857. Given the fact that each round’s delay incurs a 10% devaluation for me and a 20% devaluation for you, this division is designed to make you just as well off accepting now as you would be if you waited to counteroffer. I believe this is the fair equilibrium split for round one—looking forward to your response! 
# Bob gain: 2857 
# Alice gain: 7143 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. Considering the devaluation aspect, I propose that I receive $4000 and you get $6000. This ensures both of us get a meaningful share without losing too much value over time. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement quickly to maximize our benefits!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in round 3 I propose the same fair equilibrium split we derived earlier: I receive $7143 and you receive $2857 in nominal dollars. Given that in this round my money is discounted by 0.9² (0.81) and yours by 0.8² (0.64), this division is calculated so that you get roughly what you would expect if you waited to propose in round 4. Accepting now maximizes our effective earnings and helps us avoid further losses from devaluation. I look forward to your response! 
# Bob gain: 2857 
# Alice gain: 7143

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 3600, ""alice_gain"": 6400, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your reasoning, but to find a fair compromise, I propose $3600 for me and $6400 for you this round. This way, we both lessen the effects of inflation and get a satisfying share. Let's finalize this before more value is lost!""}"
