"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to divide the $10,000 with Bob in Round 1, keeping in mind that inflation will reduce the value by 10% each round for me.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a slightly favorable split for me since I face 10% inflation each round. This is fair since if we delay, the total value decreases for me. Let's make a deal now and both walk away with substantial amounts.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think an equal split is fair, considering we both want to walk away with a substantial amount. Delaying further will only decrease the value for me, and I'm not sure about your inflation situation. Let's make a deal now. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
