"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering a slightly favorable split for me since I face 10% inflation each round. This is fair since if we delay, the total value decreases for me. Let's make a deal now and both walk away with substantial amounts. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
