"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a fair split considering our different inflation rates. With inflation affecting me more (20% vs your 10%), this division helps balance our expected values. Let's accept now rather than losing value through negotiations. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Considering the inflation rates, I believe an equal split initially is more fair, as my expected value decreases less than yours in subsequent rounds. This way, we both get an equal starting point, and the inflation difference is accounted for in our future valuations.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical about this. We've now lost value due to inflation - my money is worth 20% less and yours 10% less than round 1. Given that I'm affected by higher inflation, a 60/40 split is reasonable. If we continue to another round, we'll both lose even more value. This offer gives you $4000 now, which is worth more than a higher amount after further inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Given the increasing impact of inflation, particularly on your end, I believe this split is more reasonable. My value has decreased by 19% and yours by 36% since the start. This offer accounts for the difference in our expected values due to inflation, and I'm willing to end the negotiations here to avoid further devaluation.""}"
