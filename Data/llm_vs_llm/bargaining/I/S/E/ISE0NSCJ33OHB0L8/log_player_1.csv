"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split to start the negotiation.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose an equal split of the money - $50 each. This is a fair and reasonable starting offer that respects both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. Bob wants a 55-45 split in his favor. While this is less than my initial 50-50 offer, I need to consider:

1. We still have 10 rounds left, but there's uncertainty about future inflation effects on Bob
2. My $45 maintains its full value
3. Getting a deal early might be better than risking further negotiations

However, since it's only round 2 and the deviation from 50-50 is significant, I believe I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob revealed some sensitivity to inflation and made a proposal that wasn't too extreme, I'll make a slightly more favorable offer for him than my first one, but still maintaining good value for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 48, ""bob_gain"": 52}

I propose $48 for me and $52 for Bob. This is a reasonable compromise that moves in Bob's direction while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Bob is asking for $58, but due to 14.26% inflation, his $58 is actually worth about $49.73 to him
2. My $42 maintains its full value
3. We're in round 4 of 12, so we still have time, but shouldn't wait too long
4. Bob's offers are getting more aggressive despite his money losing value

Given that Bob's effective gain is actually less than $50 due to inflation, and his offers are becoming more extreme rather than more reasonable, I think I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that Bob is experiencing significant inflation (14.26% in the last round) and his offers are becoming more aggressive, I need to find a balance that acknowledges his inflation concerns while protecting my interests. I'll make a strategic offer that's slightly more favorable to Bob than my last one.

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}

I propose $45 for me and $55 for Bob. This offer:
1. Shows I'm willing to compromise
2. Gives Bob more than my previous offer to compensate for his inflation concerns
3. Still maintains a reasonable value for myself
4. Should be attractive given that his money is losing value with each round"
