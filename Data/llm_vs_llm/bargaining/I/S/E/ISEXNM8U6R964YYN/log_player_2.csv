"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice's offer gives me $400,000, I should consider the declining value due to inflation. If I reject and make a counter-offer, the total value drops by 20% for me and 10% for Alice, which changes our negotiating positions.

Let me analyze this: $400,000 now is better than potentially getting a larger nominal amount in later rounds when inflation has reduced its value. However, I believe I can propose a more equitable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that acknowledges our different inflation rates while seeking a more balanced split.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split of the money. This is a fair division that gives us equal amounts, and accepting now maximizes our combined value before inflation reduces it further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider the inflation effect carefully. After 2 rounds:
- My inflation is now 36% (money is worth 64% of original value)
- Alice's inflation is 19% (money is worth 81% of original value)

Alice's current offer of $450,000 is worth $450,000 Ã— 0.64 = $288,000 in original value to me.

If I reject and we continue to the next round, inflation will further reduce the value. Since Alice has improved her offer from the initial $400,000 to $450,000, and the real value is diminishing rapidly with each round for me, this seems reasonable.
