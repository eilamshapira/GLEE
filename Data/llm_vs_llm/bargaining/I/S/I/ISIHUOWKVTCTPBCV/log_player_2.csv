"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's my turn to make an offer. I need to factor in the potential for inflation. Since this is round 2, I'll propose a split that gives me slightly more, considering the devaluation.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's think. My money is worth 36% less, and Alice is offering $4500. I need to calculate the actual value of that $4500 to me.

$4500 * (1 - 0.36) = $4500 * 0.64 = $2880

Alice gets $5500, which is worth $5500 * (1 - 0.0975) = $5500 * 0.9025 = $4963.75 to her.

This is only round 3, and I don't think this offer is good enough.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's my turn again. Inflation is becoming a real factor. I need to be aggressive to secure a decent portion. My money is now worth 48.8% less than round 1. Alice's money is now worth 14.2625% less than round 1.

Let's try this:

{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Alice's offer is 5000. My money is worth 59.04% less. Let's calculate the actual value:

$5000 * (1 - 0.5904) = $5000 * 0.4096 = $2048

This is still not great, but we are getting deeper into the rounds. I need to consider the risk of getting nothing. It's round 5, so we're not even halfway through. I think I'll reject and try to get a better deal next round, but I need to be careful.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's my turn. My money is now worth 67.232% less and Alice's is worth 22.6275% less. Let's try a slight adjustment to hopefully get an acceptance.

{""bob_gain"": 6200, ""alice_gain"": 3800}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5300 
# Alice gain: 4700 
Do you accept this offer?","Alright, let's analyze this. Alice is offering $5300. My money is worth 73.79% less.

$5300 * (1 - 0.7379) = $5300 * 0.2621 = $1390.13

That's pretty low. It's round 7, so we're past the halfway point. Alice's money is worth $4700 * (1 - 0.2649) = $4700 * 0.7351 = $3455

The difference between Alice's gain and my gain is widening. I think it's time to take a risk and accept.
