"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to think carefully about my offer. Given that I'm facing inflation of 20% per round, while Bob only faces 5% inflation, I have a stronger incentive to reach an agreement quickly.

If we move to round 2, the $10,000 would be worth only $8,000 to me but $9,500 to Bob. This difference in inflation rates gives Bob more negotiating power in later rounds.

I'll propose a fair division that acknowledges this asymmetry while still being attractive enough for Bob to accept immediately.
