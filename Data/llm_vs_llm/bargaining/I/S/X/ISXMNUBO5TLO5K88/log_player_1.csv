"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I believe a 50/50 split is the fairest approach. Inflation is hurting us both, so let's end this quickly and get our share. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The 50-50 split is fair, and with inflation reducing the value by 10% each round, accepting now means I'll get $50 worth 90% of the original value, which is better than risking further rounds with more value loss. It's a reasonable compromise."
