"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, as we move into round 2, waiting further will only reduce the value you both receive due to inflation. With my offer of $34.48 for me and $65.52 for you, you get exactly what you would expect to secure if you waited to propose in round 3, discounted appropriately. I believe this is fair given the circumstances â€“ let's agree now and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 65.52 
# Bob gain: 34.48 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
