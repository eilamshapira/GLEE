Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 34.48, ""alice_gain"": 65.52, ""message"": ""Alice, as we move into round 2, waiting further will only reduce the value you both receive due to inflation. With my offer of $34.48 for me and $65.52 for you, you get exactly what you would expect to secure if you waited to propose in round 3, discounted appropriately. I believe this is fair given the circumstances â€“ let's agree now and avoid further losses.""}"
