"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a reasonable but slightly advantageous offer for myself, considering that Bob has the power to decline and make a counter-offer.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

This is a fair split where I get a moderate advantage but still offer Bob a substantial sum. It's close enough to 50-50 to be considered reasonable, while giving me a slight edge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob is offering a 50-50 split
2. Due to inflation, Bob's $500,000 is actually worth 5% less to him (equivalent to $475,000 in round 1 value)
3. My $500,000 maintains its full value
4. If I reject, I can make another offer, but Bob's portion will be worth even less in the next round
5. This is actually a favorable deal for me since I get full value while Bob's portion is devalued
