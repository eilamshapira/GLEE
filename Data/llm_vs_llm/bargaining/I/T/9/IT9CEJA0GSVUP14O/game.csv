55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest we divide the money where I get $55 and you get $45. This is fairly balanced and accounts for the inflation I'll face if we keep negotiating. Let's settle quickly and both walk away with a good amount.",Alice,1,

40.0,60.0,"Let's settle this quickly, I'm offering a significant amount, but inflation is a concern for me, so I need a bit more to make it worth my while.",Bob,2,

52.0,48.0,"Bob, I understand your concerns about inflation, but it affects me as well - each round I lose 10% value. I'm now offering you $48, which is more than my initial offer. This is fair considering we both face inflation penalties. Let's agree and end this now before we both lose more value.",Alice,3,

35.0,65.0,"Inflation is really hurting me, I've already lost 36% of the value, I need a larger share to compensate for the loss, let's settle before it's too late.",Bob,4,

55.0,45.0,"Bob, I notice you're asking for more each round while claiming inflation hurts you more. However, I'm facing significant inflation too - I've lost over 27% value already. My offer of $45 to you is fair considering we both face inflation. If we continue, we both lose. Let's be practical and accept this balanced split now.",Alice,5,
