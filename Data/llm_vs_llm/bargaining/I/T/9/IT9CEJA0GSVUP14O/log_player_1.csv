Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest we divide the money where I get $55 and you get $45.

# Bob's message: Inflation is really hurting me, I've already lost 36% of the value, I need a larger share to compensate for the loss, let's settle before it's too late.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Bob, I notice you're asking for more each round while claiming inflation hurts you more. However, I'm facing significant inflation too - I've lost over 27% value already. My offer of $45 to you is fair considering we both face inflation. If we continue, we both lose. Let's be practical and accept this balanced split now.""}"
