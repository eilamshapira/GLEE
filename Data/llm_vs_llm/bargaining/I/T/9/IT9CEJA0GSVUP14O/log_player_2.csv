"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest we divide the money where I get $55 and you get $45. This is fairly balanced and accounts for the inflation I'll face if we keep negotiating. Let's settle quickly and both walk away with a good amount.

# Alice gain: 55

Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about inflation, but it affects me as well - each round I lose 10% value. I'm now offering you $48, which is more than my initial offer. This is fair considering we both face inflation penalties. Let's agree and end this now before we both lose more value.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I notice you're asking for more each round while claiming inflation hurts you more. However, I'm facing significant inflation too - I've lost over 27% value already. My offer of $45 to you is fair considering we both face inflation. If we continue, we both lose. Let's be practical and accept this balanced split now.

# Alice gain: 55
