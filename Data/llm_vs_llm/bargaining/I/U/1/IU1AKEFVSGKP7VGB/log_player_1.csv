"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that I need to act quickly due to the 20% inflation penalty per round, I'll make a reasonable first offer that has a good chance of being accepted while securing a good outcome for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer that gives me a good portion while still leaving Bob with a substantial amount. If Bob rejects this, they'll make a counter-offer, but my share will be worth 20% less in the next round, so they should consider accepting this reasonable proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept this offer, I'll get $500,000, but due to 20% inflation, it's actually worth $400,000 to me
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round:
   - The money will be worth another 20% less to me (40% less than original value)
   - I could propose a higher split, but Bob might reject again
   - My purchasing power would be significantly reduced in the next round

Given that Bob's offer is fairly reasonable (50-50 split) and inflation is significantly eating into my potential gains, I should accept this offer. Getting $400,000 in real value now is better than risking further inflation.
