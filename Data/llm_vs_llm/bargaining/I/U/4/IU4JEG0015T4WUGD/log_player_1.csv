"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. I need to factor in the inflation for me.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the inflation. For me, the value is 10% less than the original value.

Let's calculate the value of Bob's offer for me: 45 * (1 - 0.10) = 40.5
The offer is 40.5 for me and 55 for Bob.

I will reject this offer and try to make a better offer next round.

```json

  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, it's my turn to propose again. This time, inflation is hurting me, so I need to be a bit more aggressive. My money is now worth 20% less than in round 1.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35
}

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze Bob's offer, considering inflation.

Bob's offer to me: 48
Inflation for me: 27.1%
Real value for me: 48 * (1 - 0.271) = 48 * 0.729 = 34.992

This is significantly less than my original offer. I am running out of time. I'll risk another round.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I need to be more careful. Inflation is eating away at my potential gains. My money is now worth 34.39% less than in round 1.

}
```"

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's calculate the real value of Bob's offer for me:

Alice's Gain: 50
Inflation: 40.95%
Real Value: 50 * (1 - 0.4095) = 50 * 0.5905 = 29.525

Bob gets 50 * (1 - 0.2262) = 50 * 0.7738 = 38.69

This is not great, but it's getting late in the game. I am going to reject and make one last attempt to get a better deal.
