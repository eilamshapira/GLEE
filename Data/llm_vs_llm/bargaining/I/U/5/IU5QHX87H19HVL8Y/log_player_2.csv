"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's offering me $40 out of $100, which means she would get $60.

If I reject and counter-offer in the next round, I should remember that inflation will reduce the value by 5% for me and 10% for Alice. So in the next round, we'd be effectively dividing $95 for me and $90 for Alice.

This isn't a perfectly fair split, but it's not terrible. If I reject, I could potentially get more in my counter-offer, but I also risk losing value to inflation if negotiations continue.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll now make a counter-offer. I need to consider the inflation factors and create a proposal that's appealing enough for Alice to accept rather than continuing to another round.

Given that money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Alice in each round, I should aim for a proposal that gives Alice enough incentive to accept now rather than risking further devaluation.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'd like to explain my offer: I'm proposing a more balanced split than what Alice initially offered, but still giving her a significant portion. If we go to another round, inflation will reduce the value for both of us, so it makes sense to reach an agreement now."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's new offer carefully, taking into account the inflation that has already occurred.

Alice is now offering me $45 out of $100, which is better than her initial offer of $40. Due to inflation, this $45 is worth about 9.75% less to me than money in round 1, so it's effectively worth around $40.61 in round 1 terms.

If I reject and move to round 4, inflation will reduce the value further - by about 14.75% for me and 29% for Alice compared to round 1 values.

Alice has moved from her initial position of 40/60 to 45/55, showing willingness to compromise. The offer is more balanced now, and considering the inflation penalty we're both facing, accepting seems reasonable rather than risking further devaluation.
