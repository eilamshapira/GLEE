"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split where I get 55% and you get 45%. This is a reasonable offer considering we both need to agree, and it gives us both a substantial amount.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose an even split of 50% each. This ensures we both get a substantial amount and avoids the risk of losing everything. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Bob's offering a 50-50 split ($500,000 each)
2. For me, the $500,000 is worth full value
3. I know Bob's suffering from 10% inflation, so his $500,000 is actually worth less to him
4. We still have 10 rounds left, but further delays might make Bob's situation worse
5. $500,000 is still a significant amount, and I'd be guaranteed to get it

While I could reject and try to negotiate for more, this is actually a pretty fair offer considering I get full value. The risk of continuing and potentially getting nothing if we can't agree in 12 rounds makes this a reasonable deal to accept.
