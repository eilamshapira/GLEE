50.0,50.0,"I propose a fair 50-50 split. Since I'm affected by the 10% inflation each round, it's in both our interests to agree quickly.",Alice,1,

40.0,60.0,"I understand the inflation puts you at a disadvantage, but I believe my contribution deserves a slightly larger share.  Let's settle this quickly.",Bob,2,

50.0,50.0,"I understand you want more, but we're both losing by delaying. With inflation, I'm already getting less value each round. A 50-50 split is fair and helps us both avoid further losses. Let's conclude this now.",Alice,3,

35.0,65.0,"Alice, I'm aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement. However, the inflation disparity requires me to ask for a bit more to offset potential losses in later rounds. This offer ensures a decent share for both of us.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
45.0,55.0,"Bob, I'm compromising to find middle ground. Due to inflation, my $45 is already worth significantly less to me than at the start. Your $55 maintains full value. This is a fair compromise considering the inflation penalty I face, and further delays will hurt us both.",Alice,5,
