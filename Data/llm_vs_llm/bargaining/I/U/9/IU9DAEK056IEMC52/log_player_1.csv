Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I understand the inflation puts you at a disadvantage, but I believe my contribution deserves a slightly larger share.  Let's settle this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I understand you want more, but we're both losing by delaying. With inflation, I'm already getting less value each round. A 50-50 split is fair and helps us both avoid further losses. Let's conclude this now.""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement. However, the inflation disparity requires me to ask for a bit more to offset potential losses in later rounds. This offer ensures a decent share for both of us.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Bob, I'm compromising to find middle ground. Due to inflation, my $45 is already worth significantly less to me than at the start. Your $55 maintains full value. This is a fair compromise considering the inflation penalty I face, and further delays will hurt us both.""}"
