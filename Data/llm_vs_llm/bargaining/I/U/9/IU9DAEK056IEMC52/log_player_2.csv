"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair 50-50 split. Since I'm affected by the 10% inflation each round, it's in both our interests to agree quickly. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I understand the inflation puts you at a disadvantage, but I believe my contribution deserves a slightly larger share.  Let's settle this quickly.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want more, but we're both losing by delaying. With inflation, I'm already getting less value each round. A 50-50 split is fair and helps us both avoid further losses. Let's conclude this now. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While I understand the pressure of the inflation and Alice's point, accepting 50/50 now means I'm conceding to the pressure without leveraging the fact that future rounds hurt her more than me. I can push for a slightly better deal still."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement. However, the inflation disparity requires me to ask for a bit more to offset potential losses in later rounds. This offer ensures a decent share for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm compromising to find middle ground. Due to inflation, my $45 is already worth significantly less to me than at the start. Your $55 maintains full value. This is a fair compromise considering the inflation penalty I face, and further delays will hurt us both. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This offer is finally agreeable. While not ideal, accepting now locks in a gain that would be difficult to achieve in later rounds due to the inflation working against Alice."
