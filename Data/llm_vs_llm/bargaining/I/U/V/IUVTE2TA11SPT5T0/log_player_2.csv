"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering me $4000 while she takes $6000. While not an equal split, it's a substantial amount. I need to consider whether rejecting might lead to a better outcome in future rounds, but since there's no inflation for me (0%), there's no time pressure from my perspective.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split, offering Alice half of the total amount.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I suggest we split the money equally, with each of us receiving $5,000. This is a fair division that benefits us both equally."
