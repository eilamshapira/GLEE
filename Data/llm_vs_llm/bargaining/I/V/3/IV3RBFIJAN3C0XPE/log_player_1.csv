"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to make a fair proposal to Bob, considering that the longer this negotiation goes on, the less the money is worth to me due to the 20% inflation penalty per round. Bob doesn't face this penalty, which gives him an advantage in later rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing that I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000. This is a reasonable split that gives me a slight advantage while still being fair enough that Bob might accept rather than moving to the next round where the total value to me would decrease."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer. Even with the 20% inflation penalty, I can still make a better offer in the next round than accepting $400,000 now (which is worth only $400,000 Ã— 0.8 = $320,000 in round 1 terms to me)."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to consider the inflation factor carefully. After this round, the money will be worth 40% less to me compared to round 1, while Bob faces no penalty. I should make an offer that's attractive enough for Bob to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split of the money. This is an equitable division that gives Bob a fair share while allowing me to secure $500,000, which is better than waiting for a future round where inflation will continue to reduce the value of my gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. With the 48.8% inflation penalty in this round, the $350,000 I'd receive is equivalent to about $179,200 in round 1 terms. If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 5, I'd face a 59% inflation penalty, which would significantly reduce the value of any amount I might receive. Bob's position continues to strengthen with each round, so this is likely the best outcome I can achieve at this point."
