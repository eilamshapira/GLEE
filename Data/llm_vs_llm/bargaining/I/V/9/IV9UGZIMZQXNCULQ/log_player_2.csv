"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While this offer seems tempting, it's important to consider a few things:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly. Delaying an agreement hurts both of us.
* **Alice's rejection:** Alice rejecting my previous offer (which was quite generous to her in the face of inflation) suggests she might be aiming for a more favorable outcome for herself. 

I believe there's still room to negotiate a fairer deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50} 

**Reasoning:**

Given the increasing impact of inflation, it's time to propose a fair and simple solution: a 50/50 split. This ensures both of us receive a reasonable portion of the diminishing value.  Prompt agreement benefits both of us."
