"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll consider the effect of inflation on my gains in each round, which means I need to make a fair offer that is likely to be accepted early. Since this is Round 1, there's no inflation yet.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

A 50-50 split is fair and should have a good chance of being accepted. I understand that delaying would reduce the value of my share due to the 10% inflation per round, so it's in my interest to reach an agreement soon."
