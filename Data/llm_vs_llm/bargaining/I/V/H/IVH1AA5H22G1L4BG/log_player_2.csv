"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4737 
# Alice gain: 5263 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether accepting this offer is better than rejecting and making a counter-offer in the next round.

Alice is offering me $4,737 out of $10,000, which is about 47.4% of the total. If I reject, I'll make a counter-offer next round, but due to 5% inflation, the total value to me would be worth $9,500.

For me to benefit from rejecting, I'd need to reasonably expect to get more than $4,737 in the next round after accounting for inflation. If I could get, say, $5,000 in the next round, that would only be worth $5,000 to me, which is better than $4,737 now.

Given that I don't know how inflation affects Alice and I have a decent but not equal share, I'll reject this offer to make a counter-proposal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a slightly more balanced offer that still favors me somewhat, considering the inflation penalty I've already taken.

{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800}

I'm offering you $4,800, which is a fair portion of the total. This is a better deal than the previous split where I was offered less than half. Since I've already lost 5% value due to inflation, I believe this division is reasonable for both of us."
