307387.83,692612.17,"Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I get $307387.83 and you get $692612.17. This split is designed so that if you were to reject and make your own offer in Round 2 (where every dollar is worth 10% less for you), you’d end up with roughly the same actual value. Accepting now avoids further devaluation for both of us. Let’s settle now and avoid the inflation penalty!",Alice,1,
