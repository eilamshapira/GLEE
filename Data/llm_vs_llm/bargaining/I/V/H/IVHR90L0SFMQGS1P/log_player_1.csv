"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 307387.83, ""bob_gain"": 692612.17, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I get $307,387.83 and you get $692,612.17. This split is designed so that if you were to reject and make your own offer in Round 2 (where every dollar is worth 10% less for you), you’d end up with roughly the same actual value. Accepting now avoids further devaluation for both of us. Let’s settle now and avoid the inflation penalty!""}"
