"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I get $307387.83 and you get $692612.17. This split is designed so that if you were to reject and make your own offer in Round 2 (where every dollar is worth 10% less for you), you’d end up with roughly the same actual value. Accepting now avoids further devaluation for both of us. Let’s settle now and avoid the inflation penalty! 
# Bob gain: 692612.17 
# Alice gain: 307387.83 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
