"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the game. Let's see...

Alice is offering me $4000 in the first round. With the inflation effect, that's still $4000 for me right now. I have 12 rounds, and if I reject, the money shrinks by 10% for me in each subsequent round.

If I reject, in Round 2, I'll be proposing. I don't know Alice's strategy, so I'm uncertain how she'll react to my proposals. It's risky to assume I can get much more later, especially considering the inflation.

$4000 upfront seems like a decent start, considering the inflation pressure.
