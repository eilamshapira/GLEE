"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a proposal that considers the inflation rate difference between us. Since my inflation rate is higher, I should propose a deal that gives me a fair share while considering the diminishing value for both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering you $6,000 while I take $4,000 from the total. This is a fair split considering that if we move to another round, the total value will decrease more significantly for me than for you due to our different inflation rates."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to be more strategic considering the inflation rates. After 2 rounds, my money is now worth 36% less than the original value, while Bob's is only worth 9.75% less. I should adjust my offer accordingly.

{""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering you $5,500 while Bob gets $4,500. This is a reasonable proposal given our different inflation rates. If we continue to another round, the money will be worth significantly less for me due to my higher inflation rate (20% per round), while Bob only loses 5% per round. This offer represents a fair compromise considering these constraints."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to be more strategic now. After 4 rounds, my money is worth 59.04% less than the original value, while Bob's is only worth 19.05% less. The inflation difference is becoming quite significant.

{""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm offering an even 50-50 split of $5,000 each. This is a fair and balanced proposal that acknowledges both our positions. Given the asymmetric inflation rates where I lose 20% per round while Bob only loses 5%, continuing further rounds will disproportionately hurt me. This fair split should be acceptable to both of us and allows us to conclude the negotiation before inflation erodes even more value."
