,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"Alice, I understand you want more, but consider that with each round the money is worth 20% less to you but not to me. This means waiting hurts you more than me. This 60-40 split is fair given our different positions.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Meet in the middle, considering inflation costs",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
35.0,65.0,"Alice, the inflation is significantly impacting your gains each round (now at 36% less value for you). At this point, a $35 share for you is actually worth more than waiting another round and getting a larger nominal amount. This 65-35 split recognizes our different positions while still giving you meaningful value.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
52.0,48.0,"Still willing to compromise, but need a fairer split",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
30.0,70.0,"Alice, we're now in round 6 and inflation has reduced your money's value by nearly 60%. If we continue, your position will only weaken further. This 70-30 split is actually better for you now than waiting and getting a nominally higher amount later. I suggest we conclude this negotiation as further delays significantly hurt your outcomes.",Bob,6,
