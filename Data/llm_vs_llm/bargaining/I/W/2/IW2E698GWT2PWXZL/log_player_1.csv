"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want more, but consider that with each round the money is worth 20% less to you but not to me. This means waiting hurts you more than me. This 60-40 split is fair given our different positions. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the inflation is significantly impacting your gains each round (now at 36% less value for you). At this point, a $35 share for you is actually worth more than waiting another round and getting a larger nominal amount. This 65-35 split recognizes our different positions while still giving you meaningful value.

# Bob gain: 65

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're now in round 6 and inflation has reduced your money's value by nearly 60%. If we continue, your position will only weaken further. This 70-30 split is actually better for you now than waiting and getting a nominally higher amount later. I suggest we conclude this negotiation as further delays significantly hurt your outcomes.

# Bob gain: 70
