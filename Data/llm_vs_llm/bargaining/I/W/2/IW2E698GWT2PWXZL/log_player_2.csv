"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share for both 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to think about whether to accept this offer or not. Alice suggests I get $40 while she gets $60, calling it a ""fair share."" 

Since I don't face any inflation penalty (money is worth 0% less each round for me), but Alice faces a 20% inflation penalty per round, I have a strategic advantage in rejecting this offer and making my own proposal in the next round.

If I reject, Alice will receive my counteroffer with her money already worth 20% less. This gives me negotiating leverage to propose a more favorable split for myself.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that acknowledges our different inflation positions while still offering Alice a reasonable amount.

{""bob_gain"": 60, 
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want more, but consider that with each round the money is worth 20% less to you but not to me. This means waiting hurts you more than me. This 60-40 split is fair given our different positions.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle, considering inflation costs 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is now offering me $45 while she takes $55, which is better than her initial 40-60 offer. She's acknowledging the inflation effect on her position.

However, I still have the advantage since:
1. I face no inflation penalty (money is still worth the same to me)
2. Alice is already experiencing 36% inflation on her share
3. If I reject and we go to round 4, her money will be worth even less

Since I don't lose value by waiting and Alice does, I can likely negotiate a better split for myself.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 65, 
""alice_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Alice, the inflation is significantly impacting your gains each round (now at 36% less value for you). At this point, a $35 share for you is actually worth more than waiting another round and getting a larger nominal amount. This 65-35 split recognizes our different positions while still giving you meaningful value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Still willing to compromise, but need a fairer split 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is now offering me $48 while she takes $52, which is an improvement from her previous offers.

Key factors to consider:
1. Alice's money is now worth 59.04% less than in round 1 due to inflation
2. My money maintains its full value regardless of the round
3. If I reject again, Alice will face even steeper inflation (approaching 70%)
4. We have 12 rounds total, and we're now in round 5

Given that I have a strong negotiating position due to inflation only affecting Alice, I can likely get a better deal by rejecting this offer. The inflation pressure on Alice is becoming quite significant.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 70, 
""alice_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""Alice, we're now in round 6 and inflation has reduced your money's value by nearly 60%. If we continue, your position will only weaken further. This 70-30 split is actually better for you now than waiting and getting a nominally higher amount later. I suggest we conclude this negotiation as further delays significantly hurt your outcomes.""}"
