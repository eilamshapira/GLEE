"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with an even split. Fair for both! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split ($500,000 each)
2. This is the first round, so no inflation has occurred yet
3. If I reject, I can make my own proposal next round
4. It's a perfectly fair split
5. While I could try to negotiate for more, there's no guarantee Alice would accept a less favorable split

A 50-50 split is a fair and reasonable offer. While I could try to get more by rejecting and making a counter-offer, that strategy carries risk and Alice might reject my proposal if I'm too greedy. Since there's no inflation penalty for me, there's no immediate pressure to accept, but this is still a very good offer.
