4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, let's be reasonable. Inflation is hitting you harder. I'm offering a 55/45 split; a fair compromise.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"Okay, Bob, let's try this again. Taking inflation into account, I'm now proposing a 60/40 split. This is my final offer, so think carefully.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
3500.0,6500.0,"Alice, this is getting silly. Your money is rapidly losing value. I'm offering 65/35, a genuinely generous offer given the circumstances. Think about what you'll actually *have* if this goes on.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alright, Bob. It seems we are at an impasse. Given the continuing inflation, I propose a 50/50 split. This ensures we both get a reasonable amount. Let's end this now.",Alice,5,
