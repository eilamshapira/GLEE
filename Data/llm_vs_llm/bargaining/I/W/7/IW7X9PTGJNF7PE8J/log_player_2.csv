"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Looking at Alice's offer, she's proposing I get $4,000 while she takes $6,000 out of the total $10,000. 

Since there's no inflation for me (it's stated the money is worth 0% less for me with each passing round), I don't lose value by rejecting and making a counter-offer in the next round. This gives me an opportunity to propose a more favorable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more equitable while leaving room for negotiation if needed.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I propose we split the money equally, with each of us receiving $5,000. This is a fair division that maximizes our joint welfare."
