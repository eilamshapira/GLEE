"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it equally, considering the inflation factor, it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same, but Bob's gain is worth 5% less, splitting it equally might not be as fair to him as he thinks. Considering this, I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was to split it equally, and considering the inflation factor that affects him, I'll try to make a slightly more favorable offer for myself while still being reasonable. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, a 55/45 split seems more reasonable to me.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation keeps affecting me, this split seems fair. Let's settle this. 
# Alice gain: 460000 
# Bob gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain even more, his offer seems to be taking that into account by giving him a larger share. However, considering I'm not affected by inflation, I should try to get a better deal. But, looking at the numbers, Bob's offer is actually not bad for me, especially since I don't know how much worse the inflation will affect him in future rounds. Accepting this offer might be the safest choice to ensure I get a significant amount.
