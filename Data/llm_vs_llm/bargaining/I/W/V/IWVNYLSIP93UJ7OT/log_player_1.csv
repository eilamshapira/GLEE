"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Due to inflation, my money is worth less now.

Considering my money is worth 20% less, the $4000 Bob is offering me is only worth $4000 * 0.8 = $3200 in terms of its value to me compared to round 1.

I reject the offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for round 3, taking into account that my money is worth 20% less than in the previous round and aiming to get a better deal than Bob's offer.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze Bob's offer in round 4. The money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.

My initial offer of $6000 in round 1 now has a value of $6000 * (1 - 0.488) = $3072 in equivalent value.
Bob's offer is $4500, but its actual value to me is $4500 * (1- 0.488) = $2289.

The value of the offer has decreased significantly due to inflation.

I reject the offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for round 5, taking into account the continued inflation. My money is worth significantly less than in round 1.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's evaluate Bob's offer in round 6. My money is now worth 67.23% less than in the first round.

In round 1, I proposed an offer of $6000.
The offer's worth now is $6000 * (1 - 0.6723) = $1966.2

Bob's offer of $4800 has the equivalent value of $4800 * (1 - 0.6723) = $1573

It is still a bad offer, so I must reject it.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for round 7. I'm aiming for a better outcome while considering the continuing effects of inflation on my potential earnings.

  ""bob_gain"": 4900
}
