"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to make an offer to Bob, keeping in mind the inflation for me. I'll try to make a reasonable offer that Bob will accept, while still getting a decent amount for myself.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a terrible offer. Even with the inflation, 100,000 is far too low. I will reject this offer and try to make a more reasonable one myself next round.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I need to factor in the inflation from the previous round. The original value of the money for me is now 95% of what it was. I also need to make an offer that Bob is likely to accept, considering he rejected my first offer and made a very greedy offer in the second round.

I'll try to be more generous this time, but still aim for a worthwhile amount for myself.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20000 
# Bob gain: 980000 
Do you accept this offer?","Absolutely not! 20,000 is an insult, especially considering the inflation. I'm rejecting this offer.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, Bob is clearly being unreasonable. I need to consider the declining value of the money for me, and the fact that Bob seems determined to get the vast majority. I will try to make an offer that is slightly better for him, but still gives me something worthwhile, given the circumstances. I will need to be more desperate.

The money is now worth 85.74% of its original value to me.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 1000000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is outrageous. I refuse to accept 0. Even with the inflation, that's unacceptable.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","This is getting ridiculous. Bob is clearly trying to run out the clock. I need to make an offer that he *might* accept, even though it's less than I would ideally want, but more than nothing. The money's value to me is decreasing rapidly. It is now only worth 77.38% of what it originally was.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","This is beyond absurd. Bob is intentionally trying to sabotage this negotiation. I reject this offer on principle.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, this is critical. I have to assume Bob is acting in bad faith. I will offer him slightly more than half, even though it hurts, in a last-ditch attempt to get something out of this. The money is only worth 69.83% of the original amount to me now.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a complete waste of time. Bob is not negotiating in good faith. I reject his ridiculous offer.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I have to assume Bob will reject anything reasonable. Therefore, I will make one final attempt to salvage something, even if it's a smaller amount than I'd hoped. At this point, anything is better than nothing, as the money is now only worth 63.02% to me.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 43.12% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","This is the last round, and Bob is still being completely unreasonable. However, receiving 1 dollar is better than receiving nothing at all. Therefore, with extreme reluctance and knowing I've been completely played, I accept.

```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```"
