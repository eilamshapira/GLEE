Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Bob, I propose a division of $10,000: I'll receive $7,000 while you get $3,000. Since each round reduces my shareâ€™s value by 20%, agreeing now ensures we both secure immediate value before devaluation takes its toll. I look forward to your prompt and fair response.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose we split the money equally. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage. With no devaluation on my side, delaying might not benefit me, but I'm unsure about your side. Let's secure a fair deal now. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
