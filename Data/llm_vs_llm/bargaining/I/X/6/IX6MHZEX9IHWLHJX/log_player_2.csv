"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I propose a division of $10000: I'll receive $7000 while you get $3000. Since each round reduces my shareâ€™s value by 20%, agreeing now ensures we both secure immediate value before devaluation takes its toll. I look forward to your prompt and fair response. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000

Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, I propose we split the money equally. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage. With no devaluation on my side, delaying might not benefit me, but I'm unsure about your side. Let's secure a fair deal now.""}"
