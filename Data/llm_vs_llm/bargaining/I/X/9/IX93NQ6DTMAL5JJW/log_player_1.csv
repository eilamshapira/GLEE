"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"":900000,""bob_gain"":100000,""message"":""This is a fair offer considering the value of money declining over time. Let's make this deal!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose an equal 50-50 split, which is fair to both of us. While I face 5% inflation per round, a 90-10 split in your favor was extremely unbalanced. This equal division respects both our interests and allows us to conclude the deal now. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
