"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is a fair offer considering the value of money declining over time. Let's make this deal! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer gives me $100,000 while she takes $900,000, which is a 10/90 split. This is very unbalanced in her favor. Given that I face 5% inflation per round, waiting one round would still be better for me if I can secure a more equitable split.

If I reject and make a counteroffer next round, the $1,000,000 will be worth 5% less overall, but I can propose a much more favorable division for myself.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split that acknowledges both our positions while accounting for my inflation pressure.

{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""I propose an equal 50-50 split, which is fair to both of us. While I face 5% inflation per round, a 90-10 split in your favor was extremely unbalanced. This equal division respects both our interests and allows us to conclude the deal now.""
