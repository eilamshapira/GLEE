"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50-50 split is a fair offer. If I reject it, we'd move to the next round where the total amount is worth 10% less (only $900,000 total), and I'd have to make a counter-proposal. Since this is already an equitable division, there's no reason to lose value through inflation.
