"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle, considering inflation 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

Alice's offer is now reasonable considering the inflation. It's better to take a slightly smaller amount now than risk getting even less in further rounds."
