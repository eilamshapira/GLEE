"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Hey Bob! Considering the inflation cost I face each round, I think this offer of $70 for me and $30 for you is fair. Let's conclude the game now with both of us gaining a nice sum!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, given the inflation affecting you more, I propose $60 for me and $40 for you. This way, we both get a reasonable amount considering the next round's impact on your share. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
