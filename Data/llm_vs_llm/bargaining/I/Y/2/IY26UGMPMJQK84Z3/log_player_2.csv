"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 40$ out of 100$, this is a 40-60 split in Alice's favor. If I reject, I can make my own offer next round, but the money will be worth 20% less to me. So in the next round, a 50$ share would only be worth 40$ to me.

This means that Alice's current offer of 40$ is equivalent to what I could get in the next round with a 50-50 split (due to inflation). Also, there's no guarantee Alice would accept my counter-offer, which could lead to further rounds and more value loss.

Given these factors, this is actually a reasonable first offer.
