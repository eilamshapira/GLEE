"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is hurting us both. Let's aim for a quick agreement. This offer is a slight adjustment that should be acceptable. I'm taking a smaller cut than before. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice claims to be taking a smaller cut, the impact of inflation on her offer is unclear. It's possible she's experiencing it less severely than me. Holding out for a better offer is still the stronger move, as long as I'm careful not to push it too close to the deadline."
