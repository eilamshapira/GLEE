"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5556, ""bob_gain"": 4444, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'd like to settle this issue immediately to avoid further loss due to devaluation. My proposal is that I receive $5,556 and you receive $4,444. This split reflects our respective negotiating positions and the fact that waiting only diminishes the total amount available. I believe this is a fair and efficient outcome for both of us. What do you say?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I believe a 50/50 split is the most fair and straightforward approach. This way, we both walk away with an equal share and no hard feelings. Let's settle this quickly to avoid losing more to devaluation. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, a 50/50 split in this round is perfectly fair given that any delay only diminishes the total value we both get. I'm happy to accept your offer and settle this round swiftly to avoid any further devaluation.""}"
