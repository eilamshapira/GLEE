"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'd like to settle this issue immediately to avoid further loss due to devaluation. My proposal is that I receive $5556 and you receive $4444. This split reflects our respective negotiating positions and the fact that waiting only diminishes the total amount available. I believe this is a fair and efficient outcome for both of us. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4444 
# Alice gain: 5556 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
