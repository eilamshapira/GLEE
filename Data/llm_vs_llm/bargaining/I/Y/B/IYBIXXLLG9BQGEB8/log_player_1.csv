"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a strategic first offer, considering that rejection leads to value loss for both parties (more severely for Bob).

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

This is a fair initial offer giving me 60% and Bob 40%. If Bob rejects, the next round's $1M will be worth only $950K to me and $900K to Bob, so there's incentive to agree now."
