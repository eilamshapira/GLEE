"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to make a strategic offer that considers the inflation rates. Since the money loses 20% of value for me and 5% for Bob with each round, I should aim to make a reasonable offer now.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose a fair 50-50 split of the money. This gives each of us $5,000, which is equitable and respects both our interests. A fair division now is better than waiting for future rounds where inflation will reduce the value for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider my options carefully. If I reject and we move to round 3, the money will be worth even less due to inflation (20% less for me, 5% less for Bob). Let's analyze the current offer:

Bob is offering me $4,000, which after my 20% inflation means it's worth $4,000 × 0.8 = $3,200 in round 1 terms.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 3, even if I proposed a 50-50 split ($5,000 each), my share would be worth $5,000 × 0.8 × 0.8 = $3,200 in round 1 terms.

Given that I don't gain any advantage by rejecting, and considering the risk of further negotiation, I should accept this offer.
