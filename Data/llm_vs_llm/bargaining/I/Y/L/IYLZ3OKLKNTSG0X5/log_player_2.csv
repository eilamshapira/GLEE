"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split of the $1,000,000, which means I would get $500,000 and she would get $500,000.

If I reject this offer, I'll be able to make a counter-offer in round 2, but due to inflation, the money will be worth 10% less to me. That means the entire $1,000,000 would effectively be worth only $900,000 to me in the next round.

A fair split seems reasonable, especially considering the inflation penalty I face if I reject. If I reject and try to negotiate for more in the next round, I'm already starting from a disadvantaged position due to the 10% inflation.
