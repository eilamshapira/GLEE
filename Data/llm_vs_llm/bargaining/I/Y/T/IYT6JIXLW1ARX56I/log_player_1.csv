"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split since it's the first round, with a slight advantage to me as the first mover.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split because it's close to equal but gives me a small advantage for making the first move. It's fair enough that Bob should seriously consider accepting it rather than waiting for the next round when the total amount will be worth 20% less ($8,000)."
