"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 9999

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

I propose that I get $6000 and you get $4000. This is a fair split considering the 20% inflation penalty I face each round. If we keep going to later rounds, both of us risk getting less value, so this is a reasonable compromise that benefits us both."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 7500, ""alice_gain"": 2500}

I propose I get $7500 and you get $2500. The inflation penalty is significant - now at 49% for me. This means that each dollar I get is worth about half of what it would have been worth in round 1. This offer acknowledges the time value of money for me while still giving you a meaningful portion. Let's come to an agreement now rather than letting inflation continue to erode value."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
