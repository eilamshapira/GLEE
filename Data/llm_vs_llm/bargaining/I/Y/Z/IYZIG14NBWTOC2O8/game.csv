377668.66,622331.34,"Hi Bob, I propose the following split: I take approximately $377669 and you receive about $622331. Given that with each round the total pot depreciates by 10%, this offer gives you at least as much as you’d expect to secure on your own when it’s your turn next round. I believe this is a fair and efficient division considering our future bargaining power. Looking forward to your response!",Alice,1,
