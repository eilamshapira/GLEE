Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 377668.66, ""bob_gain"": 622331.34, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose the following split: I take approximately $377,669 and you receive about $622,331. Given that with each round the total pot depreciates by 10%, this offer gives you at least as much as you’d expect to secure on your own when it’s your turn next round. I believe this is a fair and efficient division considering our future bargaining power. Looking forward to your response!""}"
