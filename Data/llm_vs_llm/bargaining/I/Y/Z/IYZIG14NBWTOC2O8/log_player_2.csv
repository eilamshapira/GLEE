"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose the following split: I take approximately $377669 and you receive about $622331. Given that with each round the total pot depreciates by 10%, this offer gives you at least as much as you’d expect to secure on your own when it’s your turn next round. I believe this is a fair and efficient division considering our future bargaining power. Looking forward to your response! 
# Bob gain: 622331.34 
# Alice gain: 377668.66 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $622,331 (62.2%) of the $1,000,000
2. If I reject, next round the total pot will be worth $900,000 (10% less)
3. Alice's reasoning that this is more than I might secure next round is worth considering
4. Getting a deal done early prevents value loss from inflation
5. The split is in my favor, giving me the majority share

This is actually a quite generous first offer from Alice, giving me well over 60% of the pot. While I could try to negotiate for more in the next round, the 10% inflation penalty means I'd need to secure a significantly higher percentage just to match this offer.
