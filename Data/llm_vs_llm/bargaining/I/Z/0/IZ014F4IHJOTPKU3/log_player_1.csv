"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Split it evenly, no need to gamble""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I need a bit more to compensate for the inflation next round. Let's settle this quickly! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $450,000 I'd gain is actually worth $360,000 in the previous round's value. It's a bit low, but I don't want to risk losing more value in the next round.
