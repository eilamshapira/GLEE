"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid inflation losses""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I take a bit more this time, but let's still be fair considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $45 I'd receive is actually worth $45 / 0.8 = $56.25 in the previous round's value. Since Bob's offer is still relatively fair, I'll accept it to avoid further inflation losses.
