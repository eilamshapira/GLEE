"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is proposing I get only $10 while she gets $90, which is quite uneven. If I reject and we go to the next round, I can make a counter-offer, but I need to remember that due to inflation, the money will be worth 5% less to me.

If I reject, the $100 total would be worth effectively $95 to me in the next round. I could propose a much more favorable split then.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Now it's my turn to make an offer. Since I know there's 5% inflation for me in each round, I should propose a fair split that Alice would be likely to accept to avoid further rounds.

I'll propose a more equitable division that gives both of us a significant portion.
