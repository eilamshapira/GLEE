"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a division that takes into account the different inflation rates we face. Since my inflation rate (10%) is higher than Bob's (5%), I should aim for a fair but quick agreement.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because:
1. It's a reasonable first offer that gives me a slight advantage
2. It's fair enough that Bob might accept to avoid inflation losses
3. If Bob declines, we both lose value, with me losing more (10%) than Bob (5%)"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 168591 
# Bob gain: 831409 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is a very unfair offer from Bob, giving me only about 17% of the total. Even considering inflation, I can make a better counter-offer in the next round. While I'll lose 10% to inflation, I should still aim for a more equitable distribution."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that we're now in round 3, and my money is worth 20% less than the initial value while Bob's is worth 10% less, I need to adjust my strategy. I'll make a more compromising offer to encourage acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split because:
1. It's a completely fair division that's hard to argue against
2. Further delays hurt me more than Bob due to our different inflation rates
3. A balanced offer increases the chances of acceptance
4. If Bob rejects this fair offer, it reveals they're not negotiating in good faith"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 144444 
# Bob gain: 855556 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Despite the increasing inflation impact, Bob's offer is still extremely unfair, offering me only about 14.4% of the total. Even with my higher inflation rate (27.1% vs 14.26%), this split is too unbalanced. I can still make a better counter-offer in the next round, although I need to be mindful that further delays are hurting me more than Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that we're in round 5 and my money is worth 34.39% less while Bob's is worth 18.55% less, I need to make a more enticing offer to end this negotiation, as delays are hurting me significantly more than Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}

I propose this split because:
1. I'm now offering Bob a clear majority (55%) of the money
2. Given the inflation rates, further delays will hurt both of us substantially
3. This is a genuine compromise from my initial position
4. The split is reasonable enough that continuing to reject would be clearly unfair
5. With my higher inflation rate, I need to secure a deal soon"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 116406 
# Bob gain: 883594 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Although the inflation is significantly impacting my potential gains (40.95% loss now), Bob's offer of only about 11.6% of the total is still too unfair to accept. Even with my higher inflation rate, accepting such a low amount would be worse than trying one more time for a fairer split. Bob seems to be trying to exploit the inflation difference, but there must be a more reasonable middle ground."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","We're now in round 7, with my money worth 46.86% less and Bob's worth 26.49% less. Given the severe impact of inflation on my potential gains and Bob's previous aggressive offers, I need to make a more significant concession to try to reach an agreement.

{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}

I propose this split because:
1. I'm now offering Bob a substantial 60% of the total
2. My effective gain after inflation is only about 213,000 of original value
3. Further delays will be catastrophic for my position
4. This is a major concession from my previous offers
5. It's still fair enough to maintain my dignity while giving Bob a clear win
6. We're over halfway through our rounds, making agreement urgent"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 83250 
# Bob gain: 916750 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Despite the severe inflation impact (my money is worth 52.17% less now), Bob's offer of just 8.3% of the total is still exploitative. Even accounting for the inflation difference, this offer would give me less value than a more balanced split in the next round. We have 4 rounds left, and while I'm being hurt more by inflation, I need to try for a more reasonable division. Bob's increasingly extreme offers suggest they're trying to exploit the inflation difference too aggressively."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With only 4 rounds left and my money now worth 56.95% less while Bob's is worth 33.66% less, I need to make a significantly more compromising offer to avoid potentially getting nothing.

{""alice_gain"": 350000, ""bob_gain"": 650000}

I propose this split because:
1. I'm offering Bob 65% of the total, a very substantial advantage
2. My effective gain after inflation is only about 150,000 of original value
3. We're running out of rounds (only 3 left after this)
4. This is my most concessive offer yet
5. It's much fairer than Bob's last offer of ~8%
6. Further negotiation will leave us both worse off
7. It's a reasonable compromise that acknowledges Bob's stronger inflation position while still maintaining some fairness"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 36.98% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 884615 
# Bob gain: 115385 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept this offer! This is a surprising and much more favorable offer from Bob, giving me 88.4% of the total. Even with my 61.26% inflation penalty, this would give me an effective value of about 342,500 of original value, which is better than what I was offering in my last proposal. This is a much better outcome than I expected given Bob's previous very low offers, and with only 2 rounds left after this, it's wise to accept this favorable deal."
