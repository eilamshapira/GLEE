"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm proposing an equal split of $50 each. This seems fair to both of us, and accepting now means we both get the full value before inflation reduces our gains. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice proposes a 50-50 split, which is generally considered fair
2. If I reject, the next round's value will be worth 20% less to me
3. In the next round, I could propose a higher amount for myself, but Alice might reject it, leading to further rounds and more inflation
4. Getting $50 now is better than potentially getting a higher nominal amount that's worth less due to inflation

The offer is reasonable and the inflation risk makes accepting now more attractive.
