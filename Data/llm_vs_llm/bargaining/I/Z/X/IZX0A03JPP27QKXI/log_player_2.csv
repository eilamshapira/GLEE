"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

The offer gives me $40 out of $100. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value will be worth 5% less to me, so the $100 becomes effectively $95 from my perspective. 

Is it worth rejecting? If I reject, I could propose a more favorable split next round, but Alice might reject that and by round 3 we'd be dealing with even less real value. The $40 offer right now is better than getting $50 of round 2 money (which would only be worth $47.50 to me).

Given the inflation penalty and uncertainty about future rounds, I think it's better to accept this reasonable offer now rather than risk getting less value later.
