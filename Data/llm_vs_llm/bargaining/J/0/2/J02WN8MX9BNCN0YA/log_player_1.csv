"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my offer: I'll take $7,000 and you'll get $3,000. By accepting now, you secure your share instantly and avoid any potential loss from inflation in future rounds. I believe this is a fair and pragmatic split that benefits both of us. Looking forward to your response!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I believe a more equitable split is 60/40 considering the inflation.  Let's wrap this up and both walk away with a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your proposal, but I'll have to pass on this round's offer. Given that my share's value remains unchanged and only your portion is taking an inflation hit, I expect we can work towards a division that reflects that difference even more clearly. Let's continue negotiating.""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 3900, ""bob_gain"": 6100, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, for Round 3 I propose the following split: I receive $3,900 and you receive $6,100. Given that your share is subject to a 20% inflation hit (making your $6,100 effectively around $4,880 in Round 1’s value), this offer gives you a slightly better effective value than what you’d expect if we continue and you get to propose in a later round. I believe this deal fairly factors in the inflation effect on your portion, and settles our negotiation promptly before any further erosion occurs. Let’s wrap this up and secure our shares now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the inflation is hitting me hard.  This is my final offer.  Let's close this out now. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, I understand that the inflation is hitting you hard, but taking $3,000 would leave me significantly short of what I believe is fair given that my money's value remains intact. If we continue, I can craft an offer that gives me a slightly higher share than $3,000 while still ensuring you'd receive a deal that's attractive even with the inflation impact on your side. Let's keep negotiating to find a split that respects both our positions.""}"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 2950, ""bob_gain"": 7050, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I know the inflation is eating into the value of your share with every round we delay. In Round 4 your final offer would get you $7,000 nominally – which, at the current discount, is effectively around $3,584 relative to Round 1. To improve your effective payoff while wrapping this up, I'm offering you $7,050. At the present inflation rate, that means you'll effectively receive roughly $7,050 × 0.512 ≈ $3,610, a small but meaningful improvement over your fallback. I believe this deal is fair given our respective positions, and I hope we can close this quickly to avoid further losses on your end.""}"
