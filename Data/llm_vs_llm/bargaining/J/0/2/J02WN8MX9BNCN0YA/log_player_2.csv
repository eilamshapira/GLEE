Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my offer: I'll take $7000 and you'll get $3000. By accepting now, you secure your share instantly and avoid any potential loss from inflation in future rounds. I believe this is a fair and pragmatic split that benefits both of us. Looking forward to your response!

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, for Round 3 I propose the following split: I receive $3900 and you receive $6100. Given that your share is subject to a 20% inflation hit (making your $6100 effectively around $4880 in Round 1’s value), this offer gives you a slightly better effective value than what you’d expect if we continue and you get to propose in a later round. I believe this deal fairly factors in the inflation effect on your portion, and settles our negotiation promptly before any further erosion occurs. Let’s wrap this up and secure our shares now. 
# Bob gain: 6100 
# Alice gain: 3900

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I know the inflation is eating into the value of your share with every round we delay. In Round 4 your final offer would get you $7000 nominally – which, at the current discount, is effectively around $3584 relative to Round 1. To improve your effective payoff while wrapping this up, I'm offering you $7050. At the present inflation rate, that means you'll effectively receive roughly $7050 × 0.512 ≈ $3610, a small but meaningful improvement over your fallback. I believe this deal is fair given our respective positions, and I hope we can close this quickly to avoid further losses on your end. 
# Bob gain: 7050 
# Alice gain: 2950
