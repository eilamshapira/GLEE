"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, the money is now worth 20% less to me, so the total amount I consider is $10,000 * 0.8 = $8,000.

To make a fair offer, I'll propose:
{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000}"
