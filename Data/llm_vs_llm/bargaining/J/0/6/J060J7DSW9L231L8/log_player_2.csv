"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

Alice is offering a 50-50 split, with each of us getting $500,000.

I need to consider:
1. This is a fair division on its face
2. However, there's a 5% inflation penalty for Alice each round, while I face no inflation
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round where Alice's money will be worth 5% less to her
4. This gives me negotiating leverage for a better deal

Given this asymmetric inflation, I can likely negotiate a better outcome for myself by rejecting this initial offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer that accounts for the inflation asymmetry while still being reasonable enough for Alice to accept.

Since Alice faces a 5% inflation penalty per round, she should be motivated to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. If she rejects my offer and we go to round 3, her money will be worth 10% less to her in total.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing that I receive $550,000 and Alice receives $450,000. This division is slightly in my favor, but still gives Alice a substantial amount while acknowledging the inflation pressure she faces. If she rejects this, she'll face further diminishing returns in future rounds, making this a reasonable compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 575000 
# Alice gain: 425000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze Alice's new offer:

Alice is now offering me $575,000 and taking $425,000 for herself.

This is better than my previous offer where I asked for $550,000. Alice has improved my share by $25,000 compared to what I proposed.

Considering:
1. Alice has already conceded more than I initially asked for
2. She's facing increasing inflation pressure (already at 9.75%)
3. If I reject again, we go to round 4 where I could ask for more, but Alice may be less willing to accept a much worse deal
4. This current offer is already substantially in my favor

Given this meaningful improvement from my last offer and the diminishing returns of continuing to negotiate, I'll accept.
