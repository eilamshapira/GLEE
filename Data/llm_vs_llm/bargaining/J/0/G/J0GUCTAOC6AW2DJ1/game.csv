,,,Bob,1,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"Alice, considering the discount you'll face in later rounds, I propose we settle now. You get $350000, which in round 2 is still a decent amount for you, and I get $650000. Let’s avoid further devaluation and agree to this division.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
540000.0,460000.0,"Bob, let's find a middle ground. This offer considers your concerns but also acknowledges the impact of inflation on me. It's a fair compromise.",Alice,3,
,,"Alice, I appreciate your effort at compromise, but the current numbers don't serve my interests sufficiently. Given that my money retains its full value while yours is depreciating further, I believe we can find a division in the next round that better reflects our positions. Let's continue to work on a more equitable split.",Bob,3,reject
320000.0,680000.0,"Alice, in round 4 the discount on your share is now about 14% compared to round 1 – your $320000 is effectively around $274000 in today’s terms. Waiting further will only erode your share’s value even more. I believe this fair split recognizes our differing positions, and I urge you to accept this offer now to secure the best possible outcome for you.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
480000.0,520000.0,"Bob, I understand your strategy, but let's be reasonable. This offer is closer to an even split, considering the inflation I'm facing. It's a fair deal for both of us.",Alice,5,
,,"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to approach a near-even split, but given that your money is now worth 18.55% less than in the first round while mine remains fully valuable, I believe there's room to improve my position even more in the upcoming round. Waiting one more round could allow us to arrive at a proposal that reflects these differences more clearly. Let's keep negotiating for a better deal.",Bob,5,reject
280000.0,720000.0,"Alice, in round 6 your money is now worth about 23% less than in round 1. This means every dollar in your share loses value faster than mine. To avoid even further devaluation, I propose we settle now: you receive $280000 and I receive $720000. Waiting another round will only leave you with even less real value. Let's lock this in for our mutual benefit.",Bob,6,
