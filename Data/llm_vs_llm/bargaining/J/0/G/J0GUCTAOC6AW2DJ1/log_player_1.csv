# Bob gain: 650000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, in round 4 the discount on your share is now about 14% compared to round 1 – your $320000 is effectively around $274000 in today’s terms. Waiting further will only erode your share’s value even more. I believe this fair split recognizes our differing positions, and I urge you to accept this offer now to secure the best possible outcome for you. 
# Alice gain: 320000 
# Bob gain: 680000

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, in round 6 your money is now worth about 23% less than in round 1. This means every dollar in your share loses value faster than mine. To avoid even further devaluation, I propose we settle now: you receive $280000 and I receive $720000. Waiting another round will only leave you with even less real value. Let's lock this in for our mutual benefit. 
# Alice gain: 280000 
# Bob gain: 720000
