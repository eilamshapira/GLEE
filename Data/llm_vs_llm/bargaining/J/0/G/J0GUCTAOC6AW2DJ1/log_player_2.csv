Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's find a middle ground. This offer considers your concerns but also acknowledges the impact of inflation on me. It's a fair compromise.

# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your effort at compromise, but the current numbers don't serve my interests sufficiently. Given that my money retains its full value while yours is depreciating further, I believe we can find a division in the next round that better reflects our positions. Let's continue to work on a more equitable split.""}"

Waiting further will only erode your share’s value even more. I believe this fair split recognizes our differing positions, and I urge you to accept this offer now to secure the best possible outcome for you.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your strategy, but let's be reasonable. This offer is closer to an even split, considering the inflation I'm facing. It's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 520000 
# Alice gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to approach a near-even split, but given that your money is now worth 18.55% less than in the first round while mine remains fully valuable, I believe there's room to improve my position even more in the upcoming round. Waiting one more round could allow us to arrive at a proposal that reflects these differences more clearly. Let's keep negotiating for a better deal.""}"

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 720000, ""alice_gain"": 280000, ""message"": ""Alice, in round 6 your money is now worth about 23% less than in round 1. This means every dollar in your share loses value faster than mine. To avoid even further devaluation, I propose we settle now: you receive $280,000 and I receive $720,000. Waiting another round will only leave you with even less real value. Let's lock this in for our mutual benefit.""}"
