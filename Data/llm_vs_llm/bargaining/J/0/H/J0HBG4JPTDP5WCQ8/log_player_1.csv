"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a split that takes into account the different inflation rates we face. Since I (Alice) face higher inflation (10% per round) compared to Bob's 5%, I should aim for a favorable initial offer.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I offer a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is fair considering:
1. I face higher inflation risk (10% vs 5%)
2. It's still a substantial amount for Bob ($400,000)
3. If Bob rejects, we both risk losing value in subsequent rounds"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept now:
   * I get $450,000 × 0.9 = $405,000 (in round 1 value)
   * Bob gets $550,000 × 0.95 = $522,500 (in round 1 value)

2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make another offer
   * But my money will be worth 20% less than round 1
   * Bob's money will be worth 10% less than round 1
   * There's risk in further negotiation

Given that:
- The offer gives me a significant portion
- Further delays will reduce value significantly for both of us
- I face higher inflation penalty
- There's risk in continuing negotiation
