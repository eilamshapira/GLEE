"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

1. Alice is offering me 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for herself
2. If I reject, we move to the next round where:
   * The total value decreases by 5% for me and 10% for Alice
   * I get to make the next offer
3. In the next round, the money would be worth:
   * For me: 950,000$ total
   * For Alice: 900,000$ total

Since I can make the next offer and Alice's money devalues faster than mine, I think I can get a better deal by rejecting this and making a counter-offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice's money devalues faster than mine (10% vs 5% per round), I have some leverage. However, I don't want to be too aggressive as she might reject and we could both lose value through multiple rounds.

Given that the money is now worth:
- For me: 950,000$ (5% less)
- For Alice: 900,000$ (10% less)

I'll propose a slightly better split for myself than what she offered, but not too extreme:

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000}

This gives me a better deal than her initial offer while still leaving Alice with a significant amount that would be worth more than what she might get after several more rounds of depreciation."
