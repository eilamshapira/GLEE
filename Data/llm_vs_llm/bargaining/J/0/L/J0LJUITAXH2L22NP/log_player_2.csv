"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's start with a fair offer. I propose 60/40 split for me since I'm making the initial offer. This ensures we both get a substantial amount and avoids lengthy negotiations that erode our gains due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is a more fair starting point, given we both lose money with each round. Let's be reasonable and avoid further losses.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I've considered your counteroffer. I'll meet you in the middle. I propose 57/43. Given the inflation, this is beneficial for both of us rather than dragging it further. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
