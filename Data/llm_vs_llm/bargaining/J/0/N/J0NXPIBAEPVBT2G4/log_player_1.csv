"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me propose a fair split, understanding that future rounds will reduce the value for me due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. This is a reasonable offer that gives me a slight advantage while still being fair enough that Bob might accept rather than risk inflation affecting the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 5% inflation, $4000 in this round is actually worth $3800 to me.
If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount will be worth even less (10% less than original value).

Even though Bob's offer gives him a larger share, accepting now prevents further value loss from inflation. If I reject, I might end up with even less in real value after inflation.
