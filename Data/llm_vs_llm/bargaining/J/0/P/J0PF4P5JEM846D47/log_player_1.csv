"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me propose a fair split, considering that time pressure affects me more than Bob due to the 10% inflation penalty per round.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. This is slightly in my favor but still reasonably fair, considering I need to account for the possibility of future rounds where my share would be worth less due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think this through:
* If I accept this offer, I get $4,800, but due to 10% inflation, it's worth $4,320 to me
* If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount I receive will be worth 20% less due to inflation
* Even if I managed to get $5,500 in the next round, it would be worth $4,400 to me due to 20% inflation
* Bob's position gets stronger with each round due to the asymmetric inflation

Given this analysis, I should accept this offer as I'm unlikely to get a better outcome in future rounds.
