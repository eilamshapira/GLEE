"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to consider the diminishing value of the money to me with each round due to inflation, while Bob's value remains constant. As this is Round 1, I'm proposing the following split:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5100,
  ""bob_gain"": 4900
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   I'm starting with a slight advantage in my favor, as I will be the one affected by the inflation of the money in the next round.
*   This is hopefully an attractive offer for Bob, as he will receive a little less than half the money, which is still a significant amount, and there's no risk of getting less."
