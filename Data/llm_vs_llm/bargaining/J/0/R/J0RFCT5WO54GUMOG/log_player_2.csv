"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. It's a perfectly equal split (50/50)
2. It's the first round, so there's no inflation effect yet
3. While I could try to negotiate for more, there's a risk Alice might make a less favorable offer in subsequent rounds
4. A 50/50 split is generally considered fair and reasonable

Given these factors, I'll accept this offer. There's no guarantee I could get a better deal, and this is a fair division.
