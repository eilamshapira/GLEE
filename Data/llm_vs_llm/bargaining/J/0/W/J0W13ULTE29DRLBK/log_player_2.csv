"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer is a 40/60 split in Alice's favor
2. If I reject, I can make my own offer next round
3. However, due to inflation:
   * My $40 would become worth $36 (10% less) next round
   * Alice's $60 would become worth $57 (5% less) next round
4. Given the asymmetric inflation rates, delaying too long works against me more than Alice

While I might get a slightly better deal by negotiating, the inflation penalty makes this a reasonable offer. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush.
