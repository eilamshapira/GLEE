1000000.0,0.0,"Hi Bob, here’s my proposal: I take the entire $1000000 and you get $0. Since every additional round devalues your money by 20% while mine stays the same, delaying will only work against you. Accept this offer now and we both avoid unnecessary loss.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, I'm willing to give you a significant share, but I won't accept nothing. Since my money devalues with each round, I'm hoping we can settle this quickly. This offer is more than fair, considering the circumstances.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. However, I'm inclined to wait. Given the inflation structure, as the next proposer I can shape an agreement that preserves my full-dollar value while your share would further devalue. I believe I can structure a division in round 3 that – while still giving you just enough to agree – results in a better outcome for me. So I must reject this offer and proceed to the next round.",Alice,2,reject
999999.0,1.0,"Hi Bob, here’s my offer for round 3. Given the rules, your money is discounted further each round. If you reject this offer, you’ll get to propose in round 4, but you know that your future funds will be devalued even more – effectively leaving you with nothing. Therefore, I’m offering you a token $1, which is strictly better than the zero you’d end up with if we continue. Please accept this division now so we can both avoid further losses.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Alice, I know my money is worth less with each round, but I'm not willing to give up yet. I'm making a more generous offer to you this time, in the hopes that you'll see the value in ending this game now. If we continue, I'll have to make even more drastic concessions, but I'm willing to take that risk if it means a more fair division.",Bob,4,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your more generous offer this round. However, since my money isn’t discounted and I get to propose next, I can craft an agreement in round 5 that gives me nearly the full amount while leaving you just enough to make accepting preferable over further devaluation. For you, every passing round further shrinks the real value of your share—now at a 48.8% discount compared to the initial round. Given that waiting would let me secure a far better deal on my side, I must reject your 600k/400k split and proceed to the next round.",Alice,4,reject
200000.0,800000.0,"Hi Bob, here's my offer for round 5. Given that your funds now are worth only 40.96% of their face value (i.e. $800000 becomes effectively $327680), if you reject you'll be able to propose in round 6 and secure about $327680 in effective terms for yourself. Therefore, I'm offering you $800000 now—this guarantees you the same effective value as waiting, while helping us both avoid further losses. I believe this is a fair and rational proposal. Please accept.",Alice,5,
