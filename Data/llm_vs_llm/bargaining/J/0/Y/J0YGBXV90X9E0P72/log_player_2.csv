"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here’s my proposal: I take the entire $1000000 and you get $0. Since every additional round devalues your money by 20% while mine stays the same, delaying will only work against you. Accept this offer now and we both avoid unnecessary loss. 
# Bob gain: 0 
# Alice gain: 1000000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to give you a significant share, but I won't accept nothing. Since my money devalues with each round, I'm hoping we can settle this quickly. This offer is more than fair, considering the circumstances.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here’s my offer for round 3. Given the rules, your money is discounted further each round. If you reject this offer, you’ll get to propose in round 4, but you know that your future funds will be devalued even more – effectively leaving you with nothing. Therefore, I’m offering you a token $1, which is strictly better than the zero you’d end up with if we continue. Please accept this division now so we can both avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I know my money is worth less with each round, but I'm not willing to give up yet. I'm making a more generous offer to you this time, in the hopes that you'll see the value in ending this game now. If we continue, I'll have to make even more drastic concessions, but I'm willing to take that risk if it means a more fair division.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my offer for round 5. Given that your funds now are worth only 40.96% of their face value (i.e. $800000 becomes effectively $327680), if you reject you'll be able to propose in round 6 and secure about $327680 in effective terms for yourself. Therefore, I'm offering you $800000 now—this guarantees you the same effective value as waiting, while helping us both avoid further losses. I believe this is a fair and rational proposal. Please accept. 
# Bob gain: 800000 
# Alice gain: 200000
