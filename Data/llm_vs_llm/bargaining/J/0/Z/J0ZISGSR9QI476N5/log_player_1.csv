"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's make it even and split 50-50. This is fair to both, especially given that delays impact your share more. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer because with inflation, if I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, my share would be worth 20% less. Getting $50 now (worth $50) is better than potentially getting more in the next round but having it be worth less due to inflation. Also, a 50-50 split is objectively fair."
