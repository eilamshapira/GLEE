"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since Bob has the power to counter-offer.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable first offer that gives both of us a good share while leaving room for negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept now, I'll get $45 but it's worth 10% less due to inflation, so effectively $40.50
2. If I reject, I can make another offer, but I'll face 20% inflation in the next round
3. Bob's position is strong since he's not affected by inflation
4. Further negotiation might lead to worse outcomes due to increasing inflation

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer. While it's not ideal, the inflation penalty makes it risky to continue negotiating, and $40.50 is still a reasonable outcome."
