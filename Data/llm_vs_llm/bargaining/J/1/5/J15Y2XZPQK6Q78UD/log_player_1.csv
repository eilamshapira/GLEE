"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a reasonable offer that gives both of us a good portion while accounting for the risk of inflation if negotiations drag on.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. This is a fair 60-40 split that gives both of us a substantial amount, while slightly favoring me as the first mover. If Bob rejects this and we continue negotiating, inflation will reduce the real value for me, so I believe this is a reasonable starting offer."
