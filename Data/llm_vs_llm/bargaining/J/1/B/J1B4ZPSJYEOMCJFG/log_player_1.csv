"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my first offer to divide the $10,000. Since we need to be mindful of the 20% inflation each round for me, I should propose a fair division that Bob would likely accept.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose an even 50-50 split of the money. This is fair and gives us both equal amounts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I notice that Bob seems to favor himself significantly in his offer. Since the money is now worth 40% less to me due to inflation (compared to round 1), I need to adjust my strategy while still trying to be fair enough that Bob will accept.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering a slightly higher amount for myself to offset some of the inflation effects I'm experiencing, while still giving Bob a substantial portion that should be reasonable to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000
