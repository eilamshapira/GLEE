"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even with inflation, accepting $4,500 now is barely better than getting $5,000 in the first round. I'm willing to gamble that Alice might be feeling the pressure of inflation even more than I am and offer a better deal in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The value of the money is decreasing, so I need to be a bit more aggressive to try and end this quickly.  This offer is still significantly better for me than Alice's last offer, and it gives her something reasonable to consider."
