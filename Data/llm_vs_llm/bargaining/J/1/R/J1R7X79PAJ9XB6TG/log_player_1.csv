"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a division that accounts for the inflation risk I face while being fair enough to encourage Bob's acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because:
1. It gives me a slight advantage as the first mover
2. It's fair enough that Bob might accept rather than risk inflation
3. If Bob refuses, my next opportunity will be worth 20% less to me"
