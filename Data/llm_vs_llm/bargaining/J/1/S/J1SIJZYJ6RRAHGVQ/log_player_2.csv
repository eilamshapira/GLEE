"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly to start. Fair division for both. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

With a 5% inflation penalty per round, if I reject now and wait for the next round, the $500,000 would effectively become $475,000 for me. Any counter-offer I make would also be subject to Alice potentially rejecting it, leading to further inflation losses.

Given that:
1. This is a fair 50-50 split
2. I would lose value by waiting
3. There's no guarantee Alice would accept a more favorable offer from me
4. We could risk getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds

The rational choice is to accept this offer now.
