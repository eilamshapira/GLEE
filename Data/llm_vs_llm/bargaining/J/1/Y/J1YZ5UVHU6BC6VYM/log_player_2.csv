"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer gives me only 10,000 out of 1,000,000 dollars, which is just 1% of the total amount. This is an extremely low offer. Even with the 10% inflation per round, I should reject this and make a counter-proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer that accounts for the inflation pressure I'm facing.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split of the money. This is a fair division that gives each of us an equal share of the total amount. Given that I face 10% inflation with each round, it's in my interest to reach a reasonable agreement quickly, and I believe this offer is fair to both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has increased her offer to me from 10,000 to 100,000, which is 10% of the total amount. However, due to inflation, this 100,000 is now worth 19% less to me than it would have been in round 1. 

I need to consider that if I reject this offer, the next round would have inflation of about 27% for me (since it compounds), further reducing the value of any money I receive. Alice isn't affected by inflation according to the new information.

Since Alice rejected a fair 50-50 split and appears to have a strong negotiating position (no inflation pressure), I should accept this offer rather than risk getting even less value in future rounds.
