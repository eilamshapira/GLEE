Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 40/60 split is more fair for both of us. Let's agree on this and wrap it up. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous. My offer is still the best you'll get. Take it or leave it.""

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  Every round, the value of the money decreases significantly, especially for Bob. He's losing 20% per round!  This puts pressure on him to accept a deal sooner rather than later.
* **Slight Concession:**  While I'm holding firm on the overall split being in my favor, I've increased Bob's share slightly to make it more tempting. This could be enough to sway him without sacrificing too much of my potential gain.
* **Firm Language:**  The message is direct and implies this is my final offer.  This adds a sense of urgency for Bob."
