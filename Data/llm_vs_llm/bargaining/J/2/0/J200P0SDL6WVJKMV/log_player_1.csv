"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair offer to Bob, considering we both want to maximize our gains and the inflation that affects me.

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest this division because it's close to equal but gives me a slight advantage. If Bob rejects, in the next round the money will be worth less to me due to 10% inflation, so I'm incentivized to reach an agreement quickly. This is a reasonable first offer that acknowledges both our interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's 50-50 split offer. While it gives me $5 less than my initial proposal, the 10% inflation means that if I reject and we move to another round, my share would be worth even less to me. A fair split now is better than potentially losing more value to inflation in subsequent rounds."
