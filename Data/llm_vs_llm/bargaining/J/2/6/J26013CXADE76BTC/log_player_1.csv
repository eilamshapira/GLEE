Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split, recognizing that I need to account for potential inflation if Bob rejects and we go to another round.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}

I propose I get $5,200 and Bob gets $4,800. This is close to an even split but slightly in my favor since I need to account for the 5% inflation risk if Bob rejects and we move to another round."
