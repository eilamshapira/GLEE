"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to think carefully about Alice's offer and consider both the current split and how inflation affects us in future rounds.

Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000, which is 40% of the total. If I reject, we move to the next round, but the money will be worth 20% less to me, meaning the $10,000 would effectively be worth only $8,000 to me. So my maximum possible gain in the next round would be $8,000 (if I somehow got all of it).

For Alice, the money depreciates by 10% per round, so the $10,000 would be worth $9,000 to her in the next round.

If I make a counter-offer, Alice might still reject it, leading to further rounds and more depreciation. Given the asymmetric inflation rates, delaying agreement harms me more than it harms Alice.

$4,000 now is better than risking further rounds with significant depreciation.
