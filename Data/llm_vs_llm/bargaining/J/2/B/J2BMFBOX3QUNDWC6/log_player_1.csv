"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, considering that future rounds will reduce my gains due to 5% inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because while a 50-50 split might seem fair, waiting for future rounds will reduce my potential gains due to inflation. By offering Bob a substantial portion ($450,000) while keeping a slightly larger share for myself ($550,000), I'm hoping to incentivize Bob to accept immediately rather than moving to the next round where my money would be worth less due to the 5% inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept, I get $480,000 at 95% value = $456,000 effective value
2. If I reject and propose in next round:
   - Money will be worth another 5% less for me (90% of original)
   - My previous offer didn't work
   - Bob seems to want a majority share

Given that waiting another round will significantly decrease the value of money for me, and Bob's offer gives me a reasonable amount ($456,000 effective value), it makes sense to accept now rather than risk further devaluation.
