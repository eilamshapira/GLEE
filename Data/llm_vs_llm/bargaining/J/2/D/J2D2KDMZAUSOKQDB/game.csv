4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, given the time discount and our mutual interest in avoiding further devaluation, I propose that I receive $5500 and you receive $4500. This slightly favors me as the proposer in round 2, but it still offers you a robust share relative to what you might secure in later rounds. I believe this division is fair considering the discount differences and will save us both from further losses. What do you say?",Bob,2,
