"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, given the time discount and our mutual interest in avoiding further devaluation, I propose that I receive $5500 and you receive $4500. This slightly favors me as the proposer in round 2, but it still offers you a robust share relative to what you might secure in later rounds. I believe this division is fair considering the discount differences and will save us both from further losses. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
