"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split.  I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits both of us.

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, given the time discount and our mutual interest in avoiding further devaluation, I propose that I receive $5,500 and you receive $4,500. This slightly favors me as the proposer in round 2, but it still offers you a robust share relative to what you might secure in later rounds. I believe this division is fair considering the discount differences and will save us both from further losses. What do you say?""}"
