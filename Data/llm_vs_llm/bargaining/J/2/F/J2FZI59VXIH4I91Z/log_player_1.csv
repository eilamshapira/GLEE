"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a division that takes into account the 10% depreciation per round for Bob. Since I know Bob could counter-offer, but would receive less value in the next round, I'll make a reasonable first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this split because it gives Bob a significant portion while being fair to both parties. If Bob rejects this offer, the $4000 would be worth only $3600 to him in the next round due to the 10% depreciation on his side."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer carefully:

1. For Bob, the 5500$ is actually worth 4950$ (90% of 5500$ due to 10% depreciation)
2. If I reject, we go to round 3 where:
   - I can make a new offer
   - Bob's money will depreciate another 10%
   - I maintain full value
3. This means I would have more leverage in the next round
4. The current offer gives me 4500$, which is less than my initial proposal

Given these factors, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round due to Bob's increasing depreciation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Now that we're in round 3, Bob's money has depreciated by 20% from the original value. I can use this to make a strategic offer. Any money Bob gets now is worth only 80% of its nominal value to him.

{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500}

I propose this split because:
1. For Bob, the 3500$ is actually worth 2800$ (80% of 3500$ due to 20% depreciation)
2. If Bob rejects this, in the next round his money will be worth only 70% of nominal value
3. This makes accepting this offer more attractive to Bob than continuing to negotiate
4. It's better than his previous offer to me (4500$)"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. For Bob, the 5000$ is actually worth only 3645$ (72.9% of 5000$ due to 27.1% depreciation)
2. If I reject and go to round 5:
   - I can make a new offer
   - Bob's money will depreciate even more (to about 65% of original value)
   - My money maintains full value
3. The current offer gives me 5000$, which is better than the previous 4500$
4. However, given Bob's significant depreciation, I can likely secure an even better deal in the next round

Since Bob's position is weakening significantly with each round due to depreciation, I believe I can get a more favorable split by continuing.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Now we're in round 5, and Bob's money has depreciated by about 37.1% from the original value (each round compounds the 10% loss). Any amount Bob receives is worth only 62.9% of its nominal value to him. This gives me significant leverage to make a stronger offer.

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

I propose this split because:
1. For Bob, the 3000$ is actually worth about 1887$ (62.9% of 3000$ due to 37.1% depreciation)
2. If Bob rejects this, in the next round his money will be worth even less (about 56.6% of nominal value)
3. The rapid depreciation makes it rational for Bob to accept now rather than continue negotiating
4. While this may seem aggressive, it reflects the reality of the depreciation Bob faces
5. Bob should recognize that further delays will only worsen his position"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this Round 6 offer:

1. For Bob, the 4500$ is actually worth only 2657$ (59.05% of 4500$ due to 40.95% depreciation)
2. If I reject and go to round 7:
   - The depreciation will increase to about 47% for Bob
   - My money maintains full value
   - I can make the next offer
3. The current offer gives me 5500$
4. The depreciation is becoming very significant now
5. However, given the strong depreciation effect, I can still likely get a better deal in the next round

Since Bob's money is losing value rapidly and I maintain full value, I believe I can secure an even better position by continuing.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In round 7, Bob's money has depreciated by about 47% from the original value (continuing the compound 10% loss per round). This gives me very strong leverage as any amount Bob receives is worth only about 53% of its nominal value to him.

{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500}

I propose this split because:
1. For Bob, the 2500$ is actually worth only about 1325$ (53% of 2500$ due to 47% depreciation)
2. If Bob rejects this, his money will depreciate even further in the next round (to about 48% of nominal value)
3. At this point, continuing the negotiation is very costly for Bob
4. This offer, while seemingly aggressive, is actually rational given the severe depreciation Bob faces
5. Bob should recognize that accepting now is better than continuing, as his position will only worsen with time
6. The rapid depreciation makes this offer more valuable to Bob than what he might get in future rounds"
