"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a fair 50-50 split of the money, but I need to consider the inflation effect. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value will be 10% less to me. Let me evaluate:

If I accept now: I get $500,000
If I reject and we go to the next round: The total money would be worth 10% less to me, so even if I got the entire $1,000,000 in the next round, it would only be worth $900,000 to me.

Given this inflation risk, a guaranteed $500,000 now is quite reasonable.
