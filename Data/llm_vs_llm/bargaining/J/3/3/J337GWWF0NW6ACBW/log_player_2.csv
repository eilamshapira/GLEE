"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the amount with a slight advantage to me to account for inflation. This way, we both get a fair share considering the decreasing value of money over time. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $4,500 while she gets $5,500 of the $10,000. While this isn't an even split, I need to consider the inflation factor.

If I reject this offer, we move to the next round where I can make a counter-offer. However, due to inflation, the money will be worth 5% less to me in the next round. This means the $10,000 would effectively be worth $9,500 to me in round 2.

If I accept now, I get $4,500 immediately. If I reject and we end up with approximately the same proportional split next round, I'd get less in real value.

Given the inflation penalty and the reasonable offer (45% for me), I'll accept Alice's proposal.
