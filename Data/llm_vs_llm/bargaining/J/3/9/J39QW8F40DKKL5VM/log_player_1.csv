"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer to Bob, considering that money is worth 10% less to him in each passing round.

{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}

I propose that I receive $750,000 and Bob receives $250,000. This is a reasonable offer that gives Bob a substantial portion while recognizing that delaying the agreement would reduce the value for him due to the 10% inflation on his side."
