6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because I'm affected by 10% inflation each round, while you're not. Let's make a deal now and both walk away with a good amount.",Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, I understand your inflation concern, but 60-40 was too steep. Here's a 55-45 split in my favor. If you accept now, your $4500 is worth more than what you'd get after another round of 10% inflation. Let's make a fair deal and avoid further devaluation of your share.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, let's be reasonable. With my 10% inflation penalty per round, I need a bit more than 50-50 to make this fair. I'm offering you a solid $4500 while I get $5500. This way we both get a good deal, and we avoid further rounds where my share keeps losing value. Please accept so we can both walk away happy.",Alice,3,
