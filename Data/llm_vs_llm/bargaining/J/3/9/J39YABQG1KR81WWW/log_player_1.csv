"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because I'm affected by 10% inflation each round, while you're not. Let's make a deal now and both walk away with a good amount.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your inflation concern, but 60-40 was too steep. Here's a 55-45 split in my favor. If you accept now, your $4500 is worth more than what you'd get after another round of 10% inflation. Let's make a fair deal and avoid further devaluation of your share. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The offer isn't good enough considering my inflation penalty. While Bob is right that inflation will reduce my future gains, I can still make a better counter-offer in the next round where even with 10% inflation I would end up with more value than accepting $4500 now."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Bob, let's be reasonable. With my 10% inflation penalty per round, I need a bit more than 50-50 to make this fair. I'm offering you a solid $4500 while I get $5500. This way we both get a good deal, and we avoid further rounds where my share keeps losing value. Please accept so we can both walk away happy.""}"
