"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because I'm affected by 10% inflation each round, while you're not. Let's make a deal now and both walk away with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice wants $6000 (60%) and offers me $4000 (40%)
2. She's right that she faces 10% inflation per round while I don't
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
4. Her $6000 would be worth only $5400 to her next round (10% less)
5. This gives me negotiating leverage in the next round
6. Since I don't face inflation, I can afford to wait and potentially get a better deal

Given these factors, I'll reject this offer. I can propose a more favorable split next round, and Alice will be more likely to accept due to her inflation pressure.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a strategic counter-offer:

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your inflation concern, but 60-40 was too steep. Here's a 55-45 split in my favor. If you accept now, your $4500 is worth more than what you'd get after another round of 10% inflation. Let's make a fair deal and avoid further devaluation of your share.""}

This offer is strategic because:
1. I'm offering her $4500 now, which is worth more than $6000 in a future round due to her inflation
2. The split is more favorable to me but still reasonable
3. I emphasize the time pressure she faces to encourage acceptance
4. The message is professional and acknowledges her situation"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. With my 10% inflation penalty per round, I need a bit more than 50-50 to make this fair. I'm offering you a solid $4500 while I get $5500. This way we both get a good deal, and we avoid further rounds where my share keeps losing value. Please accept so we can both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is now offering me $4500 (45%) and wants $5500 (55%)
2. Her $5500 is actually worth only $4455 to her due to 19% inflation
3. This is a more reasonable offer than her first one
4. If I reject:
   - We move to round 4 where her inflation increases to 28%
   - I could try for a better deal, but she might be less willing to accept
   - We risk moving closer to the 12-round limit
5. The split is fairly reasonable considering the inflation she faces
6. The difference from my previous offer is not large enough to justify the risk of continuing

Given these factors, I'll accept this offer. It's a fair compromise that gives both of us a good outcome.
