500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Bob, I'd like to propose a fair, 50/50 split right away. Since every round delays the payoff for me (due to 20% depreciation per round), I think itâ€™s in both our interests to settle immediately. I look forward to your agreement and a swift resolution.",Alice,1,

350000.0,650000.0,"Given that you face depreciation and I don't, this split actually benefits you more than waiting for future rounds. If you reject, your next round's value will be 20% less, making even a larger share worth less than this offer. I suggest we conclude the deal now.",Bob,2,
