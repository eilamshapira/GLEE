"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'd like to propose a fair, 50/50 split right away. Since every round delays the payoff for me (due to 20% depreciation per round), I think itâ€™s in both our interests to settle immediately. I look forward to your agreement and a swift resolution.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given that you face depreciation and I don't, this split actually benefits you more than waiting for future rounds. If you reject, your next round's value will be 20% less, making even a larger share worth less than this offer. I suggest we conclude the deal now. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
