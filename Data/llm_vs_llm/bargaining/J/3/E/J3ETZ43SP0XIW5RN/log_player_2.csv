"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'd like to propose a fair, 50/50 split right away. Since every round delays the payoff for me (due to 20% depreciation per round), I think itâ€™s in both our interests to settle immediately. I look forward to your agreement and a swift resolution. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering a 50/50 split ($500,000 each)
2. She mentions she faces 20% depreciation per round
3. I face 0% depreciation per round
4. This means I have a stronger negotiating position - I can wait without losing value
5. Since Alice loses 20% each round, she's more pressured to reach a deal
6. If I reject, I can make a more favorable offer next round when her position is weaker

Given these factors, it would be strategically better to reject this offer and propose a more favorable split in the next round, as I have more leverage due to the asymmetric inflation effects.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that Alice faces 20% depreciation per round while I face none, I can propose a split more in my favor. However, I shouldn't be too aggressive as Alice might still reject if the offer is too unfair.

Since Alice's value will depreciate by 20% if she rejects this offer, I'll propose a 65/35 split, which should still be more valuable to her than getting a larger share in the next round.

{""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Given that you face depreciation and I don't, this split actually benefits you more than waiting for future rounds. If you reject, your next round's value will be 20% less, making even a larger share worth less than this offer. I suggest we conclude the deal now.""}"
