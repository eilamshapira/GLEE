800000.0,200000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a split of $800000 for me and $200000 for you. This is actually fair when we account for the 20% inflation penalty you face each round. If we go to the next round, your $200000 would be worth only $160000 to you, so this offer provides you maximum value.",Alice,1,
