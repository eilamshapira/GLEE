"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a split of $800000 for me and $200000 for you. This is actually fair when we account for the 20% inflation penalty you face each round. If we go to the next round, your $200000 would be worth only $160000 to you, so this offer provides you maximum value. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
