"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer. Let me think about the implications:

If I accept now, I get $40.
If I reject, I'll make an offer in the next round, but due to inflation, every dollar will be worth 10% less to me. The total value for me would be $90 compared to the current $100.

While 40:60 isn't an even split, considering the inflation penalty, rejecting might be risky. If negotiations drag on, the total value decreases with each round, so getting $40 now might be better than potentially less later.

However, I believe I can propose a fairer split in the next round that Alice might accept, so I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair offer to Alice that considers both our interests. Since I rejected her offer, I need to make a reasonable counter-proposal that she's likely to accept, considering we both face potential losses if we drag this out too long.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing an even 50-50 split of the $100, which represents fairness and equality in our negotiation. This gives us both a good outcome and avoids the continued devaluation from inflation in future rounds."
