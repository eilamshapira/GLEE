"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair and split it equally, 50-50. What do you say, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer seems fair, dividing the $10,000 equally between us. Since this is the first round and the money still has its full value, accepting now means we both get $5,000. If I reject, we risk losing value due to the 20% inflation per round, and there's no guarantee I'd get a better deal later.
