Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer to divide the $1,000,000. I want to propose a fair split that Bob will likely accept.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm offering an equal 50/50 split of the million dollars, which gives each of us $500,000. This is a fair and equitable division that respects both of our interests equally."
