"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I'm ready. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's calculate the value of the money considering inflation for Alice.

In Round 1, I would have received $6000.
In Round 2, the money is worth 20% less, so the value of $4000 I'm offered is:

$4000 * (1 - 0.20) = $4000 * 0.80 = $3200

Since $3200 is less than I would have received if I accepted in round 1 ($6000), I should reject this offer.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, considering the diminishing value of the money for me, here's my offer for Round 3:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's calculate the value of the money considering inflation for Alice.

In Round 1, I would have received $6000, and now it's worth 48.8% less.
The value of $4500 I'm offered is:

$4500 * (1 - 0.488) = $4500 * 0.512 = $2304

Since $2304 is significantly less than I would have received in round 1 ($6000), I should reject this offer.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, considering the continued inflation, here's my offer for Round 5. The value of money has dropped even more for me.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value for Alice in this round:

*   Original offer (Round 1): $6000
*   Inflation: 67.23%
*   Alice's offer in this round: $4800
*   Value for Alice: $4800 \* (1 - 0.6723) = $4800 \* 0.3277 = $1572.96

Since $1572.96 is significantly less than the $6000 I would have received in round 1, I should reject this.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, considering the continued inflation, I need to adjust my offer to be more appealing.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 5050, ""bob_gain"": 4950}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4950 
# Bob gain: 5050 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate Alice's situation in this round.

*   Original offer (Round 1): $6000
*   Inflation: 79.03%
*   Alice's offer in this round: $4950
*   Value for Alice: $4950 \* (1 - 0.7903) = $4950 \* 0.2097 = $1038.02

Considering that the current value is very low and the risk of getting nothing increases, I will accept the offer to salvage some money.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I have to be more aggressive now. The value of my money is drastically decreasing.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 5010, ""bob_gain"": 4990}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4990 
# Bob gain: 5010 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate Alice's situation in this round.

*   Original offer (Round 1): $6000
*   Inflation: 86.58%
*   Alice's offer in this round: $4990
*   Value for Alice: $4990 \* (1 - 0.8658) = $4990 \* 0.1342 = $669.96

The value is decreasing very rapidly. With only two rounds left, I think I have to try and get something. I will reject.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, this is round 11, and the value of the money is extremely low for me. I need to adjust my strategy to be as appealing as possible, I will try to salvage anything.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 5001, ""bob_gain"": 4999}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 91.41% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4999 
# Bob gain: 5001 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze the offer.

*   Original value (Round 1): $6000
*   Inflation: 91.41%
*   Alice's gain: $4999
*   Alice's effective gain: $4999 * (1 - 0.9141) = $4999 * 0.0859 = $429.41

At this point, it's the last round, and I am losing a lot of money, but I can't receive nothing if I reject. I will accept the offer.
