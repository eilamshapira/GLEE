"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly down the middle, 50-50. It's a fair start and we both benefit equally. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice's offer of a 50-50 split ($500,000 each) is fair, but if I reject it, I could propose my own split in the next round. However, due to the 5% inflation penalty, the total value would decrease to $950,000 in the next round, meaning even if I got a larger percentage, it might not be worth more in absolute terms.

For example, even if I managed to get 60% in the next round, that would be $570,000 of the deflated amount, which is only slightly better than the current $500,000 offer, and Alice might reject it anyway, leading to further rounds and more value loss.

Given this, I think accepting the fair 50-50 split now is the optimal choice.
