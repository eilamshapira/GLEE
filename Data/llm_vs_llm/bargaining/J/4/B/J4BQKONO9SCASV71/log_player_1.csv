"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to consider the inflation effect on my gains and make a reasonable offer. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

My reasoning: I'm starting with a slight advantage by proposing first. A 60/40 split gives me a little more, but it's still reasonable enough that Bob might accept it rather than risk losing value to inflation in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to carefully consider this. Bob is offering a 50/50 split. Because of inflation, my half is now worth 20% less than it would have been in the first round.

*   **Value of $50 now:** $50 * 0.80 = $40 (relative to the first round).

Essentially, Bob is offering me $40 in today's money. I need to decide if that's better than risking further inflation in the next round, where I would be the proposer. If I reject, my subsequent offer will be worth another 20% less *on top of the first reduction*. That means the money would only be worth 64% (80% of 80%) of the initial value.

I'll accept the offer.
