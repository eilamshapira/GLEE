"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. 

Alice is offering a 50-50 split: $500,000 for me and $500,000 for her. This is objectively fair in terms of equal division.

However, I need to consider the inflation effect. If I reject this offer, we move to the next round where I can make a counter-offer, but the money will be worth 20% less to me. So if I reject now, the total value to me will be at most $800,000 ($1,000,000 Ã— 0.8) in the next round.

Given that Alice is offering me $500,000 now, which is more than half of what I could potentially get in the next round (if I were to get all $800,000 of effective value), accepting now seems rational.
