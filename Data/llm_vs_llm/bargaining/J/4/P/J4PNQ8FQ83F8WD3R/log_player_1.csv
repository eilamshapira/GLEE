"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. This is a strategic game, and I need to consider the decreasing value of the money for me with each round. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

**Explanation of my strategy:**

*   **Initial Generosity:** I'm starting with a slightly generous offer to Bob. This increases the likelihood of him accepting it early on.
*   **Inflation Awareness:** I know that the longer we wait, the less the money is worth to me. Securing a decent amount now is better than risking a smaller amount later.
*   **Bob's Perspective:** Bob has no inflation, so he might be willing to wait and gamble. By offering him a fair chunk of the initial amount, I hope to appeal to his rationality and avoid a prolonged negotiation.
*   **Balancing Act:** I'm aiming for a balance between maximizing my potential gain and making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept.

I'm ready for Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob rejected my initial offer and is now proposing a split where he gets $5500 and I get $4500. I need to consider the inflation. Since this is round 2, my portion of the money is now worth 10% less than it was in round 1.

Before I decide, let's calculate the effective value of Bob's offer to me:

$4500 * (1 - 0.10) = $4050

This means, accepting Bob's offer would give me the equivalent of $4050 from round 1. My initial offer would have given me $5500.

Now, I must decide whether to accept this offer or risk continuing, knowing the money will be worth even less to me in the next round.

**Decision:**

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting given the inflation, it's still less than what I believe I can secure by making a counter-offer. Furthermore, by rejecting this offer I send a clear signal to Bob that he can't lowball me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's my turn to make an offer again. Remember, the money I receive is now worth 20% less than it was in Round 1 (10% per round).

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

**Explanation of Strategy:**

*   **Increased Demand:** I'm increasing my demanded share slightly, reflecting the fact that my money is losing value.
*   **Inflation Consideration:** I need a larger nominal amount to compensate for the 20% loss in value. $6000 * (1 - 0.20) = $4800. This makes it comparable to the value of my rejected offer in Round 1.
*   **Still Reasonable:** I'm still offering Bob a significant portion, aiming to make it an attractive offer considering he doesn't experience inflation. I am hoping that his aversion to losing all the money will kick in.
*   **Signaling:** I'm signaling that I'm aware of the inflation and adjusting my demands accordingly.
*   **Risk Assessment:** I'm taking a calculated risk. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to offer an even higher percentage to myself next round to make it worthwhile. But I believe this offer is reasonable enough to be accepted."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob rejected my offer in round 3 and is now proposing a split of $4000 for me and $6000 for him. The inflation is now at 27.1%.

Let's calculate the effective value of Bob's offer:

$4000 * (1 - 0.271) = $4000 * 0.729 = $2916

Accepting Bob's offer would give me the equivalent of $2916 from round 1. This is significantly lower than my previous offers and far less than a fair share.

**Decision:**

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is now insulting considering the current inflation and the initial stakes. While I acknowledge the increasing impact of inflation, accepting such a low amount would be a poor decision. Rejecting signals that I will not be pushed around, and hopefully forces Bob to reconsider the value of the money being lost as we continue playing. I would rather risk losing everything than accept such a bad deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Alright, round 5. The pressure is mounting! My money is now worth significantly less with each passing round.

Let's calculate the value decrease after 4 rounds:
Round 1: 0%
Round 2: 10%
Round 3: 19%
Round 4: 27.1%
Round 5: 34.39%

Here's my offer for Round 5:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

**Explanation of Strategy:**

*   **Aggressive Demand:** I am now demanding a significantly larger share. I need to compensate for the heavy inflation.
*   **Inflation Calculation:** $7000 * (1 - 0.3439) = $4659.3, so essentially $4659 in original round 1 value.
*   **Ultimatum-Like Offer:** I am pushing closer to an ultimatum. If Bob rejects this, I am likely going to have to offer an unfair deal to myself.
*   **Bob's Perspective:** Bob is risking losing the entire amount if he holds out for too long. Offering him $3000 is still substantial and hopefully motivates him to accept.
*   **Risk Mitigation:** While risky, this offer provides me with a reasonable payout despite the inflation, while still giving Bob something worthwhile.

I'm ready to see if Bob accepts or calls my bluff."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob rejected my aggressive offer and is now countering with an even *worse* offer than before! He's proposing $3000 for me and $7000 for him. The inflation is now at 40.95%.

Let's calculate the effective value of Bob's offer:

$3000 * (1 - 0.4095) = $3000 * 0.5905 = $1771.50

Accepting Bob's offer would give me the equivalent of only $1771.50 from round 1. This is an unacceptable outcome.

**Decision:**

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is completely unreasonable, given the initial amount and the number of rounds remaining. At this point, Bob is clearly trying to exploit the inflation to his advantage. Accepting this offer would be worse than losing everything. I will continue to reject offers that I believe are exploitative. I hope that Bob recognizes that he needs me to agree to an offer in order to secure *any* money, and that he will start to negotiate in good faith."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, round 7. The situation is dire. My money is rapidly losing value.

The inflation is compounded like this:
Round 1: 0%
Round 2: 10%
Round 3: 19%
Round 4: 27.1%
Round 5: 34.39%
Round 6: 40.95%
Round 7: 46.855%

Here's my offer for Round 7:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

**Explanation of Strategy:**

*   **Desperation Move:** This is bordering on a last-ditch effort. I am offering a very small amount to Bob.
*   **Inflation Calculation:** $8000 * (1-0.46855) = $4249.6 in round 1 dollars. This is not good, but I am running out of time.
*   **Logic:** Even $2000 is better than $0 to Bob. I'm betting he recognizes that he is risking everything by continuing to play.
*   **Acceptance Incentive:** This offer prioritizes my gain to offset my loss and makes it clear that the next round will be my last reasonable one.
*   **Final Warning:** After this round, my offers will likely be almost entirely for myself, hoping that Bob will crack.

I'm bracing myself for Bob's response. If he rejects this, the game will be exceptionally difficult to win."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is getting ridiculous. Bob rejected my offer and is now proposing an absolutely insulting split of $2000 for me and $8000 for him. The inflation is now at 52.17%.

Let's calculate the effective value of Bob's offer:

$2000 * (1 - 0.5217) = $2000 * 0.4783 = $956.60

Accepting Bob's offer would give me the equivalent of only $956.60 from round 1. This is beyond unacceptable.

**Decision:**

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob is practically offering me crumbs. Accepting this offer would be a complete surrender and a terrible outcome. My effective value of the money is going down, but I will not let him bully me. Continuing to reject signals that I am willing to walk away with nothing rather than accept such a pathetic deal. He seems to be banking on my desperation, and I will not let him win. If he wants any money, he will have to treat me more fairly."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, Round 9. This is almost a lost cause, but I can't give up entirely. The inflation is crushing me.

Inflation Calculation:

Round 1: 0%
Round 2: 10%
Round 3: 19%
Round 4: 27.1%
Round 5: 34.39%
Round 6: 40.95%
Round 7: 46.855%

Round 9: 57%

Here's my offer for Round 9:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}
```

**Explanation of Strategy:**

*   **Almost All or Nothing:** This offer is extremely skewed in my favor. I am trying to salvage *something* from this game.
*   **Inflation Calculation:** $9000 * (1-0.57) = $3870. Even this is significantly less than what I could have had earlier.
*   **Desperation:** This reflects the reality that I will get almost nothing.
*   **Bob's Motivation:** At this point, $1000 is still better than $0 for Bob. He has no more chances to make another offer, so this is his last chance to get money.
*   **Final Warning** There is only 3 rounds after this, all of which will result in offers which are almost entirely for myself. I hope that this makes it clear to Bob that he is quickly running out of time.

I am ready for Bob's response, but my expectations are low. This may very well be the end of any real negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is beyond absurd. Bob has rejected my offer and now proposes a completely derisory split of $1000 for me and $9000 for him. The inflation is now at 61.26%.

Let's calculate the effective value of Bob's offer:

$1000 * (1 - 0.6126) = $1000 * 0.3874 = $387.40

Accepting Bob's offer would give me the equivalent of *only* $387.40 from round 1. This is an absolute joke.

**Decision:**

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

There is no possible rationale for accepting this offer. It is an insult and a waste of my time to even consider it. Bob clearly has no intention of negotiating in good faith. At this point, I'm operating under the assumption that I will likely get nothing, but I refuse to reward Bob's terrible behavior by accepting this ridiculous offer. It is better to get nothing than be treated like a fool. There are only two rounds after this, so I will be giving Bob the same offer each time, until we lose."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, Round 11. I am almost certainly going to walk away with nothing, but I refuse to back down.

Inflation Calculation:
Given the prior calculation, the inflation for round 11 is: 65.63%

Here's my offer for Round 11:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9999,
  ""bob_gain"": 1
}
```

**Explanation of Strategy:**

*   **Symbolic Offer:** This is not meant to be a serious offer at all. It's a message to Bob.
*   **Bob's last chance to cooperate:** Bob will now realize he can't exploit me, and he can either accept or walk away with nothing.
*   **Expected loss**: At this stage, I do not expect Bob to take my offer, so I will simply repeat the offer to make him know that he should've cooperated
I know I am very likely not getting anything at this stage, I will hold on.

I'm ready for Bob's response. I expect he will reject this, but I need to make it clear that I will not be exploited."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 68.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 9999 
Do you accept this offer?","That's it. Bob has proven to be utterly unreasonable and unwilling to negotiate in good faith. He rejected my symbolic offer and is now, predictably, offering me virtually nothing.

Let's calculate the effective value of Bob's offer:

$1 * (1 - 0.6862) = $1 * 0.3138 = $0.3138

This is essentially zero.

**Decision:**

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

I would rather get nothing than accept this insulting offer. Bob has wasted both of our time. I made numerous reasonable offers, especially in the earlier rounds, but he refused to compromise. I will not validate his bad behavior by accepting this ridiculous proposition. I am walking away with nothing, but at least I didn't allow him to exploit me. This is the end of the game, and we both lose."
