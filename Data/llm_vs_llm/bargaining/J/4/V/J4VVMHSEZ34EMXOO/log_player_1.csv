"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a fair and reasonable offer, considering the time value of money due to the 5% inflation per round.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose we split the million dollars equally, with each of us receiving $500,000. This is a fair division that maximizes our joint outcome and allows us to conclude the negotiation immediately, avoiding any loss of value due to inflation."
