"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Split it evenly, fair for both""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A bit more for me, but still a substantial amount for you. The money is now worth 10% less for you, consider that in your decision 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the 10% inflation, the $400,000 I'd gain is actually worth $400,000 * 0.9 = $360,000 to me.

Given this, I think I can do better. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less to me now (10% less each round), I'll make an offer that takes this into account.

My offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a fair deal for both""
}
```
This way, I'm trying to balance my decreasing value with a still reasonable offer for Bob."
