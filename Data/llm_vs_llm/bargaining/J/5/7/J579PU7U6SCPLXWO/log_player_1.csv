"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split while accounting for potential future inflation if negotiations drag on. Since I'm making the first move, I'll offer slightly more to Bob to encourage acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 4800, ""bob_gain"": 5200}

This splits the money in a 48%-52% ratio, giving Bob a small advantage to incentivize accepting the deal now rather than risking inflation losses through multiple rounds."
