"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. Alice is offering me $5,200 out of the $10,000, which is slightly more than half (52%). This is a reasonable first offer.

If I reject and we go to the next round, I can make a counter-offer, but I need to consider that the money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation. This means the $10,000 would effectively be worth only $8,000 to me in the next round, so even if I got all of it (which is unlikely), I'd still be getting less value than accepting $5,200 now.

It's a fair first offer that gives me the majority share, and considering the inflation penalty for me, I should accept.
