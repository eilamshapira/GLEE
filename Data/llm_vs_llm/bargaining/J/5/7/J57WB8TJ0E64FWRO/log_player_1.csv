"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because if you reject, the next round will mean 10% less value for me, making future negotiations less efficient for both of us.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. Given that the value of money decreases for you each round, this offer still leaves you with a significant amount while compensating me fairly for the risk of further rounds. Let's settle this now to avoid further loss in value for you. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
""decision"": ""accept""
}

I accept Bob's offer because:
1. Due to 10% inflation, my $450,000 is now worth $405,000 in round 1 terms
2. If I reject and propose a new split in round 3, the money will be worth another 10% less to me
3. Bob made a reasonable argument and the split is not too unfavorable
4. Further negotiation rounds would likely lead to worse outcomes for me due to the increasing inflation penalty"
