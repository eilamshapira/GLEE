"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because if you reject, the next round will mean 10% less value for me, making future negotiations less efficient for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. Given that the value of money decreases for you each round, this offer still leaves you with a significant amount while compensating me fairly for the risk of further rounds. Let's settle this now to avoid further loss in value for you.""
