450000.0,550000.0,"Since you face 5% depreciation per round, I understand your urgency. However, a 55-45 split in my favor is more reasonable. If you reject, your share will be worth even less next round due to inflation. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances.",Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"I understand your perspective, but let's meet in the middle. A 55-45 split in my favor this time to compensate for the inflation I'm experiencing. It's still a fair deal for both of us.",Alice,3,
