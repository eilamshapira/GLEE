"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since you face 5% depreciation per round, I understand your urgency. However, a 55-45 split in my favor is more reasonable. If you reject, your share will be worth even less next round due to inflation. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
