"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40 in my favor to account for inflation. It's a fair start considering the devaluation I face each round. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice wants a 60-40 split in her favor, offering me $400,000.

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round. The key point is that Alice faces 5% depreciation per round, while I don't face any depreciation. This means:
1. Alice's $600,000 would be worth $570,000 to her next round
2. My money keeps its full value

This gives me negotiating leverage. I can likely get a better deal by rejecting and making a counter-offer, since Alice has more urgency to close the deal due to her depreciation penalty.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that acknowledges the inflation factor but is more favorable to me.

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Since you face 5% depreciation per round, I understand your urgency. However, a 55-45 split in my favor is more reasonable. If you reject, your share will be worth even less next round due to inflation. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your perspective, but let's meet in the middle. A 55-45 split in my favor this time to compensate for the inflation I'm experiencing. It's still a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is now offering me $450,000 (up from her initial $400,000)
2. She's asking for $550,000, which due to the 9.75% inflation, is actually worth about $496,375 to her
3. If I reject, in the next round:
   - Her inflation penalty increases to about 15%
   - I could make another counter-offer
   - But we're also using up rounds (only 9 left)

While I could hold out for more, this offer is a reasonable compromise:
- It's better than her first offer
- The effective split (considering her inflation) is closer to 50-50
- There's risk in prolonging negotiations
