517378.0,482622.0,"Hi Bob, here's my proposal for Round 1. Considering that with each subsequent round the total value drops by 20%, we need to act efficiently. I’m offering you $482622 and I keep $517378. This division reflects the equilibrium incentives if we were to continue to later rounds. I believe this is a fair offer that secures you a solid outcome compared to waiting in a depreciating pot. Let’s agree and make our deal now!",Alice,1,

480000.0,520000.0,"Hi Alice, since we're now in Round 2 and the total value has decreased by 20%, I propose we split the remaining $800000 as follows: I take $520000 and you take $480000. This offer is slightly more in my favor to account for the risk and time spent, but it's still a fair deal considering the diminishing value. Let's settle this now before it gets any smaller!",Bob,2,
