"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 517378, ""bob_gain"": 482622, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal for Round 1. Considering that with each subsequent round the total value drops by 20%, we need to act efficiently. I’m offering you $482,622 and I keep $517,378. This division reflects the equilibrium incentives if we were to continue to later rounds. I believe this is a fair offer that secures you a solid outcome compared to waiting in a depreciating pot. Let’s agree and make our deal now!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since we're now in Round 2 and the total value has decreased by 20%, I propose we split the remaining $800000 as follows: I take $520000 and you take $480000. This offer is slightly more in my favor to account for the risk and time spent, but it's still a fair deal considering the diminishing value. Let's settle this now before it gets any smaller! 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
