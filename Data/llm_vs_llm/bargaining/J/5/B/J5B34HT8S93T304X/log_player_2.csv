"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal for Round 1. Considering that with each subsequent round the total value drops by 20%, we need to act efficiently. I’m offering you $482622 and I keep $517378. This division reflects the equilibrium incentives if we were to continue to later rounds. I believe this is a fair offer that secures you a solid outcome compared to waiting in a depreciating pot. Let’s agree and make our deal now! 
# Bob gain: 482622 
# Alice gain: 517378 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, since we're now in Round 2 and the total value has decreased by 20%, I propose we split the remaining $800,000 as follows: I take $520,000 and you take $480,000. This offer is slightly more in my favor to account for the risk and time spent, but it's still a fair deal considering the diminishing value. Let's settle this now before it gets any smaller!""
