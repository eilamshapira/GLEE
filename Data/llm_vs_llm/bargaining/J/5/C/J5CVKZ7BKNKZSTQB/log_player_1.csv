"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a division of $100 between Bob and myself, keeping in mind the 5% inflation penalty per round if we don't reach an agreement.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest this split because it's relatively fair while giving me a slight advantage. Since I face a 5% inflation penalty each round, there's an incentive for me to reach an agreement quickly. I hope Bob finds this division acceptable so we can conclude our negotiation efficiently."
