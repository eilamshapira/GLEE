"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 10% less to me. 
Currently offered: $45
Next round value: $45 * 0.9 = $40.50

To get a better outcome next round, I'd need Alice to accept an offer giving me more than $50, which seems unlikely given her current fair-ish offer.

Since $45 now is better than a risky counter-offer with 10% inflation, I'll accept.
