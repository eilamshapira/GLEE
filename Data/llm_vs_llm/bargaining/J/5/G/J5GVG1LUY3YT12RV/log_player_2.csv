"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. A 50-50 split might seem fair at first glance, but considering the inflation rates, I should be mindful that my money will lose value faster (20%) than Alice's (10%) if we go to further rounds.

However, this is still a reasonable first offer. I would get $5000 right now, which is better than risking getting less in future rounds due to inflation and potential less favorable offers.
