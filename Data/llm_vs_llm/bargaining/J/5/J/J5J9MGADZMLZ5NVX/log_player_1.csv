"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I'll make my offer. Considering the inflation, I need to secure a good amount for myself.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the 20% inflation, the $400,000 I'd receive now is only worth $320,000 compared to the initial value. While Bob's offer is better for him, I need to consider my own benefit and the diminishing value of the money. Accepting now would mean a total loss.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, let's try again. The inflation is really eating into my potential earnings. I'll adjust my strategy to account for the decreasing value of the money.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
