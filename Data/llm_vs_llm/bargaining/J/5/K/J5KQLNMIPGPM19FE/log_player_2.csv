# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain is worth 40.96% of the original value (1 - 0.5904 = 0.4096), so the effective gain would be 44 * 0.4096 = 18.0224. 

Given the significant decrease in value due to inflation, I should consider accepting an offer that gives me a reasonable amount, even if it's not ideal.
