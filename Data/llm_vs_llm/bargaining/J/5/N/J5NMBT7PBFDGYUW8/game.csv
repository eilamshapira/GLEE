8000.0,2000.0,I think this is a fair first offer. Let's get this done quickly and efficiently!,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
0.0,10000.0,"Alice, if you reject this offer and move to the next round, you'll face the equilibrium scenario where your share remains 0. To avoid prolonging the game to our mutual detriment, I propose that I keep the entire $10000, which is exactly what rational backward induction predicts. Please accept this offer so we can conclude the game.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
7000.0,3000.0,"Alright, let's try this again. This is still a favorable split for me. Take it or leave it!",Alice,3,
,,"Alice, thanks for your offer, but I must reject. Given that if we continue to the next round I'll have the opportunity to propose a division, I believe I can secure a more favorable outcome for myself.",Bob,3,reject
1.0,9999.0,"Alice, if you reject this offer, you'll be in position to propose in round 5. However, as we work backwards through the remaining rounds, you'll ultimately end up with only $1 because I, as the proposer in round 6 and later rounds, can dictate nearly the entire pie. To avoid a lengthy game where your payoff remains minimal, I suggest you accept this offer now.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"This is a better deal than the last one, Bob. Let's keep this moving. I'm being generous!",Alice,5,
,,"Alice, while 4000 is certainly an improvement compared to your earlier offers, rejecting now gives me the chance to propose a split in the next round that, based on our backward induction analysis, will maximize my gain considerably more. Therefore, I must reject your offer and look forward to proposing in round 6.",Bob,5,reject
2.0,9998.0,"Alice, if you reject this offer and move to Round 7, you'll be forced to propose a split that leaves you with only $1 in equilibrium. By accepting this offer now, you secure $2 â€“ a strict improvement over your alternative. Let's wrap this up efficiently.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Okay Bob, let's go 50/50. This is the fairest offer yet, and we both get a good chunk of money.  Take it.",Alice,7,
,,"Alice, a 50/50 split is fair and ensures we both walk away with a substantial amount. Let's end the game here and share the money equally.",Bob,7,accept
