Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, if you reject this offer and move to the next round, you'll face the equilibrium scenario where your share remains 0. To avoid prolonging the game to our mutual detriment, I propose that I keep the entire $10000, which is exactly what rational backward induction predicts. Please accept this offer so we can conclude the game.

# Bob gain: 10000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, if you reject this offer, you'll be in position to propose in round 5. However, as we work backwards through the remaining rounds, you'll ultimately end up with only $1 because I, as the proposer in round 6 and later rounds, can dictate nearly the entire pie. To avoid a lengthy game where your payoff remains minimal, I suggest you accept this offer now.
