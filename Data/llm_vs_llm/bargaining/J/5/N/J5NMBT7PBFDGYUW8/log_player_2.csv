"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 10000, ""alice_gain"": 0, ""message"": ""Alice, if you reject this offer and move to the next round, you'll face the equilibrium scenario where your share remains 0. To avoid prolonging the game to our mutual detriment, I propose that I keep the entire $10,000, which is exactly what rational backward induction predicts. Please accept this offer so we can conclude the game.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Alright, let's try this again. This is still a favorable split for me. Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for your offer, but I must reject. Given that if we continue to the next round I'll have the opportunity to propose a division, I believe I can secure a more favorable outcome for myself.""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 9999, ""alice_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Alice, if you reject this offer, you'll be in position to propose in round 5. However, as we work backwards through the remaining rounds, you'll ultimately end up with only $1 because I, as the proposer in round 6 and later rounds, can dictate nearly the entire pie. To avoid a lengthy game where your payoff remains minimal, I suggest you accept this offer now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is a better deal than the last one, Bob. Let's keep this moving. I'm being generous! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Alice, while 4000 is certainly an improvement compared to your earlier offers, rejecting now gives me the chance to propose a split in the next round that, based on our backward induction analysis, will maximize my gain considerably more. Therefore, I must reject your offer and look forward to proposing in round 6.""}"

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 9998, ""alice_gain"": 2, ""message"": ""Alice, if you reject this offer and move to Round 7, you'll be forced to propose a split that leaves you with only $1 in equilibrium.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's go 50/50. This is the fairest offer yet, and we both get a good chunk of money.  Take it. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Alice, a 50/50 split is fair and ensures we both walk away with a substantial amount. Let's end the game here and share the money equally.""}"
