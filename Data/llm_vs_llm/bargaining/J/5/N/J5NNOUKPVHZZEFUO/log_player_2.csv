"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze the offer.

*   **Alice's offer:** Bob gets $50, Alice gets $50.
*   **Inflation:** Since it's Round 1, the money is worth its full value for both players.
*   **Rounds Remaining:** 12 rounds.

If I reject, I have to make an offer in Round 2. The money is worth less (20% less for me, 5% less for Alice), and there's no guarantee Alice will accept my offer. I might end up with less than $50, or even nothing if we reach Round 13. Given the inflation, $50 in round 1 is worth more than a potentially higher amount later.
