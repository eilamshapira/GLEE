"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 377668.66, ""bob_gain"": 622331.34, ""message"": ""Hi Bob. Based on our 12‐round bargaining with a 10% devaluation per round, I’ve worked out the subgame perfect equilibrium split. If you reject this offer, you’d get to propose in Round 2 but the total amount would fall to $900,000—and by backward induction, you’d secure about $622,331 from that stage on. To avoid further discounting, I propose that I receive approximately $377,669 and you about $622,331 right now. I look forward to settling this deal immediately.""}"
