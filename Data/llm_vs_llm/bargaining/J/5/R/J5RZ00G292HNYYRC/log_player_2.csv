"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob. Based on our 12‐round bargaining with a 10% devaluation per round, I’ve worked out the subgame perfect equilibrium split. If you reject this offer, you’d get to propose in Round 2 but the total amount would fall to $900000—and by backward induction, you’d secure about $622331 from that stage on. To avoid further discounting, I propose that I receive approximately $377669 and you about $622331 right now. I look forward to settling this deal immediately. 
# Bob gain: 622331.34 
# Alice gain: 377668.66 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
