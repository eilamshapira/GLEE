"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to conclude this quickly, and you'll get your money right away without any inflation impact.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation, I'd like to propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This way, we both get a significant amount, and we can conclude this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 5% inflation for me, if I accept:
My $4,500 is actually worth $4,275 (4500 * 0.95)

If I reject and we go to another round:
- The money will be worth even less (another 5% reduction)
- I'll have another chance to make an offer, but Bob might reject again
- The continued inflation makes quick resolution valuable

While this isn't as good as my initial offer, it's still a substantial amount, and the inflation penalty makes waiting risky. A guaranteed $4,275 in real value is better than risking further devaluation.
