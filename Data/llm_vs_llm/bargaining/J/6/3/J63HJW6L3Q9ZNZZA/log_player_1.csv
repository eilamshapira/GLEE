"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair initial offer to Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose we split the money equally - 50 dollars for each of us. This is a fair division that gives us both the same amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I see that Bob is proposing a division that favors himself. Let me make a reasonable counter-offer.

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}

I propose I receive $45 and Bob receives $55. This gives Bob the majority of the money while still being fair to both of us. Given that inflation is affecting Bob's gains each round, this is a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","I notice that Bob is pushing for a larger share, but the inflation is affecting him more with each round. Let me adjust my offer to be more attractive to both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60}

I propose I receive $40 and Bob receives $60. This gives Bob a significant majority of the money while still ensuring I get a reasonable portion. Given the increasing inflation effect on Bob's gains, this offer should be appealing as we're now in round 5."
