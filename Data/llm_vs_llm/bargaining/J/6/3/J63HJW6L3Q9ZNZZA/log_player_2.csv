Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

This offer is tempting as it's the best one I've seen so far, but it still heavily favors Alice. I'm banking on the inflation impacting her decision-making more in later rounds."

Round 4

{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35}
``` 

I'm raising my stake slightly, even though the value is decreasing. This might push Alice to accept before the inflation makes it significantly worse for me."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

It's still not ideal, but the inflation is starting to become a significant factor. It's better to take a decent offer now than risk getting a much worse deal later."
