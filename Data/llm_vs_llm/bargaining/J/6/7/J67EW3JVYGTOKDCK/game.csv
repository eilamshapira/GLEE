450000.0,550000.0,"Bob, I propose we settle this now: you get $550000 and I take $450000. Each additional round costs me 10% in value, so agreeing today helps both of us avoid the risk and loss of further delay. I believe this fair split benefits you given your stronger bargaining position, so letâ€™s lock in our rewards immediately.",Alice,1,
