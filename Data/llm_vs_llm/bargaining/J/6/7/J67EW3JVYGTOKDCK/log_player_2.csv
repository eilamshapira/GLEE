"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I propose we settle this now: you get $550000 and I take $450000. Each additional round costs me 10% in value, so agreeing today helps both of us avoid the risk and loss of further delay. I believe this fair split benefits you given your stronger bargaining position, so letâ€™s lock in our rewards immediately. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since this is the first round and I have no information about Alice's actual inflation rate, I'll consider the offer based on its face value. Given that I'm being offered $550,000 out of $1,000,000, which is 55% of the total, it seems like a reasonable starting point. However, I also need to consider the potential for negotiating a better deal in subsequent rounds, taking into account that the money's value to me doesn't decrease with each round, but I don't know how it affects Alice.

Given that Alice mentions her loss increases by 10% with each round, it implies she is under pressure to agree sooner rather than later, which could be leveraged in negotiations. However, starting with a 55% share is not a bad position for me.

Considering these factors, my initial instinct might be to reject the offer to see if I can negotiate a better deal, but given the risk of losing everything if we fail to agree within 12 rounds, and considering this is a relatively fair offer, I might lean towards accepting to secure a significant gain.
