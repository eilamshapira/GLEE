"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""I suggest a fair 60-40 split in my favor. This is a reasonable offer considering we both want to avoid the 20% inflation penalty in the next round.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you value getting this settled quickly, but I believe a more equitable split is in order.  Let's be reasonable and avoid further inflation penalties. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think this through:
* My original offer would have given me $600,000
* In this round, Bob offers me $475,000, but due to 20% inflation, this is actually worth $380,000 to me
* If I reject and we go to the next round, any amount will be worth even less due to compounding inflation
* Bob's offer is quite reasonable given the circumstances, and the inflation penalty makes waiting costly
