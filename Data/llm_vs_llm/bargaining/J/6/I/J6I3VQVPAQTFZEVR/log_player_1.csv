"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose a 50-50 split which is the most fair division. We both face inflation risks, and a fair split now is better than prolonged negotiations where we both lose value. This way, we both walk away with a substantial amount. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer. This is a fair 50-50 split, and with inflation affecting future rounds, it's better to secure $5000 now (even with 5% inflation) than risk further negotiations where the value continues to decrease. The equal division is reasonable, and prolonging the game would likely not lead to a significantly better outcome for me."
