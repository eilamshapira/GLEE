"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split which is fair considering we both need to reach an agreement. I'm offering you a substantial $4000 which is better than risking further rounds where inflation will reduce the value for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice offers me $4000 out of $10000 (40%)
2. If I reject, the next round will have 5% inflation, meaning the total value for me would be $9500
3. I could counter-offer, but Alice might reject, leading to more rounds and more value loss
4. $4000 now is better than risking multiple rounds of rejections
5. However, I think I can get a better deal, and even with 5% inflation, I'd still have room to negotiate

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer while acknowledging the inflation risk:

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, I propose a 50-50 split which is the most fair division. We both face inflation risks, and a fair split now is better than prolonged negotiations where we both lose value. This way, we both walk away with a substantial amount.""}"
