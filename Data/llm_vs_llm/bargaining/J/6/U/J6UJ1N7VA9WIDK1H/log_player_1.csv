"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this division to ensure both parties receive a substantial amount, with a slight advantage to me as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While it's slightly less favorable than my initial proposal, it's still a fair split and the difference ($100,000) isn't worth the risk of continued negotiation where we might both end up worse off. This is a reasonable outcome."
