"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split it 60/40. This is a fair offer considering we both lose value over time. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: I get $40, Alice gets $60
2. If I reject and propose next round:
   - The total value decreases
   - For me: 10% less value
   - For Alice: 20% less value
   - I could propose a better split for myself, but Alice might reject

3. Analysis:
   - If I reject, the $100 becomes worth $90 to me and $80 to Alice
   - Even if I propose a more favorable split next round, the absolute value I receive might be lower due to inflation
   - 40$ now is better than a larger percentage of a smaller pot later

4. Decision:
   The offer isn't great, but considering the inflation penalty and the risk of further negotiations, it's reasonable enough.
