Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the value of the money decreases with each round due to inflation, I need to take that into account. The money is now worth 5% less than in round 2. Bob's offer was unacceptable. I will try a more balanced offer, aiming to secure a reasonable gain for myself while considering the diminishing value.
