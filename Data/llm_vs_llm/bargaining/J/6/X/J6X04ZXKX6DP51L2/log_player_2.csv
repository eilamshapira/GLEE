"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split as it's more equitable than Alice's initial offer while still giving me a slight advantage as compensation for her very unfair first proposal. This offer leaves both of us with a substantial sum and avoids further devaluation of the total amount through inflation in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a reasonable offer, especially considering:
1. The split is close to 50-50
2. If I reject, inflation will reduce the value further
3. Alice has shown willingness to move towards a fairer distribution from her initial very uneven offer"
