550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, let's start with a fair split. I propose 550k for me, 450k for you. This is a generous offer in Round 1, considering the looming inflation. Let's take it!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm confident we can find something more equitable. How about we reverse the amounts? 550k for me, and 450k for you this time.",Bob,2,

600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, inflation is hitting us both hard. I need to account for my losses. I propose 600k for me, 400k for you. It's still a good deal for you given the circumstances.",Alice,3,

475000.0,525000.0,"Alice, I understand the inflation is a concern, but we need to find a compromise. 525k for me and 475k for you feels like a fair deal considering the circumstances. Let's settle this before inflation eats away at the value any further.",Bob,4,

650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, this is getting critical. My money is rapidly losing value. My final offer for a while: 650k for me, 350k for you. This reflects the increasing risk I'm taking by continuing this negotiation.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, this back and forth isn't helping anyone. We're both losing money due to inflation. Let's just split it evenly, 500k each. This ensures we both walk away with a reasonable amount.",Bob,6,
