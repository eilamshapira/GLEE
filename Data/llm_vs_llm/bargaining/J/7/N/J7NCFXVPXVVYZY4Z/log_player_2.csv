"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Let's see if Alice can do better than that. Since the value of the money decreases for me with each round, I'd like to get a bigger share earlier."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

Let's start with an even split. It's fair and simple. I hope Alice agrees that this is a reasonable offer, considering that the value of the money is decreasing for me with each round."
