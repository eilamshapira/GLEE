2649.08,7350.92,"Hi Bob, I’m offering you $7350.92 and keeping $2649.08 for myself. I’ve worked out a proposal that equalizes your immediate gain with what you’d expect if you waited until the next round (after a 5% devaluation). This way you’re just as well off accepting now as you’d be by delaying, so let’s close the deal quickly and secure our shares!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
500.0,9500.0,"Alice, I'm willing to give you $500 to close this deal quickly. We both know that every round we go, the value of our shares decreases. Let's be practical and split the money fairly.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
2262.19,7737.81,"Hi Bob, in this round the pie is still $10000 but with our inflation factors the values shift a bit. If you reject this offer, you'll get to propose in round 4 where, after discounting, your effective payoff will be the same as the $7737.81 I’m offering you now. Thus, by accepting my offer you secure an equivalent outcome immediately. Let’s agree on this fair split and avoid further losses to inflation!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
1500.0,8500.0,"Alice, it seems we're both determined to get the best deal. However, I believe this is a fair compromise given the inflation and the risk of losing everything if we don't agree.  Let's end this game and secure our shares.",Bob,4,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your effort to reach a quick resolution. However, by accepting your current offer I would secure $1500, and given that I will have the chance to propose in the next round — where I can craft an offer that takes into account the worsening discount on your share — I can guarantee myself a better outcome. Therefore, I must reject your offer in hopes of securing a more favorable split in Round 5.",Alice,4,reject
1875.0,8125.0,"Hi Bob, here's my proposal for Round 5: I take $1875 and you get $8125. With the current discounting—your share being worth about 0.8145 of its nominal value—this means you’d effectively get roughly $8125 × 0.8145 ≈ $6618 in today’s terms. If you reject and wait for Round 6, you’d lose even more value due to further discounting, even though you'll get the proposer role then. Accepting now secures an outcome for you that is on par with your continuation value. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us under the circumstances. What do you say?",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"Alice, we're getting closer to the end of this game, and the risk of losing everything is increasing with each round. I propose we split the money 70/30 in my favor, considering the inflation we've experienced. This offer is fair and reflects the value we've both lost. Let's end this game and secure our shares.",Bob,6,
,,"Hi Bob, while I appreciate you’re trying to close the deal quickly, your offer gives me $3000—which is less than what I anticipate I can secure by proposing in the next round. Additionally, your effective share would be around $5416 after the discount, and by delaying further, I can craft a proposal that better reflects the value erosion on your side. I believe it’s in both our interests to play for a fairer split in Round 7, so I’m going to reject this offer.",Alice,6,reject
2517.0,7483.0,"Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for Round 7. Under the current inflation, every dollar you receive is worth only about 0.7351 of its face value. That means if you accept this offer, you get an effective value of roughly 0.7351×7483 ≈ $5500. If you reject and wait for Round 8, your discount factor will drop further—to about 0.6983—so you’d have to work much harder to secure even this effective amount. In light of that, I propose that I take $2517 and you get $7483, which fairly reflects your fallback position and protects you against further loss. I believe this is a reasonable and mutually beneficial deal, so let’s finalize the agreement now before the clock works against us.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
3500.0,6500.0,"Alice, we're both losing money with every round. It's time to be realistic. I propose we split the money 65/35 in my favor, accounting for the significant inflation we've experienced. This is a fair offer, and it's the best chance we have to secure some of the money before it's all gone.",Bob,8,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your effort to close the deal and your proposal to split $10000 as $3500 for me and $6500 for you. However, under the current discount, your $6500 is effectively worth only about $4539 (since it's 30.17% less than its face value), which suggests there's room to craft a proposal in Round 9 that could give you an even better effective outcome. Given that I’ll be proposing next round—and I can design the split to account for your further discounting—I believe it's in our mutual interest to wait. Therefore, I must reject your offer now in hopes that we secure a better outcome in the upcoming round.",Alice,8,reject
3200.0,6800.0,"Hi Bob, here's my proposal for Round 9. Under the current inflation, every dollar you receive is now worth about 66¢ of its face value. That means if you accept, the $6800 allocated to you will be worth roughly $4489 in real terms. If you reject and wait for Round 10, you’ll be in the proposer’s seat, but further depreciation will likely push your effective payoff even lower. Given that waiting only hurts your eventual outcome, I believe this split – $3200 for me and $6800 for you nominally – is fair and aligns with your continuation value. Let’s settle now to avoid additional losses due to inflation.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, we're running out of time. I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor to compensate for the significant inflation we've faced. It's the best chance we have to get something before we both lose everything. Let's be reasonable and end this game.",Bob,10,
,,"Hi Bob, while I appreciate your need to close the game, your 60/40 split gives me $4000. However, if we reject this offer, I'll get the proposer role in Round 11. Given that Round 12 means nothing for both of us, I can craft a proposal in Round 11 that leaves you virtually no choice but to accept—even if it means you receive only a token amount—because your alternative is nothing. Since my share is not affected by inflation and I can secure nearly the entire $10000 if we move into Round 11, I must reject your offer here.",Alice,10,reject
160.0,9840.0,"Hi Bob, here's my proposal for Round 11. Given our inflation situation, every dollar you receive now is worth roughly 58 cents in real terms. If you reject this offer, you'll be the proposer in Round 12, and even though you could claim nearly the entire $10000 nominally, your eventual effective value would be about $10000 × 0.5711 ≈ $5711. To make you just as well off now as you would be by waiting, I'm offering you a nominal $9840, which at 58 cents per dollar gives you roughly $5707—essentially matching your continuation value. I will receive the remaining $160. This deal secures your share before any further loss of value occurs. I believe this is the most rational split given the circumstances. What do you say?",Alice,11,
