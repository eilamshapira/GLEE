Bob's offer:

If you reject and wait for Round 6, you’d lose even more value due to further discounting, even though you'll get the proposer role then.

If you reject and wait for Round 8, your discount factor will drop further—to about 0.6983—so you’d have to work much harder to secure even this effective amount. In light of that, I propose that I take $2,517 and you get $7,483, which fairly reflects your fallback position and protects you against further loss. I believe this is a reasonable and mutually beneficial deal, so let’s finalize the agreement now before the clock works against us.""}"

Given that I’ll be proposing next round—and I can design the split to account for your further discounting—I believe it's in our mutual interest to wait.
