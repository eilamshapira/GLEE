"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m offering you $7350.92 and keeping $2649.08 for myself. I’ve worked out a proposal that equalizes your immediate gain with what you’d expect if you waited until the next round (after a 5% devaluation). This way you’re just as well off accepting now as you’d be by delaying, so let’s close the deal quickly and secure our shares!

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in this round the pie is still $10000 but with our inflation factors the values shift a bit. If you reject this offer, you'll get to propose in round 4 where, after discounting, your effective payoff will be the same as the $7737.81 I’m offering you now. Thus, by accepting my offer you secure an equivalent outcome immediately. Let’s agree on this fair split and avoid further losses to inflation!

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal for Round 5: I take $1875 and you get $8125. With the current discounting—your share being worth about 0.8145 of its nominal value—this means you’d effectively get roughly $8125 × 0.8145 ≈ $6618 in today’s terms. If you reject and wait for Round 6, you’d lose even more value due to further discounting, even though you'll get the proposer role then. Accepting now secures an outcome for you that is on par with your continuation value. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us under the circumstances. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 8125 
# Alice gain: 1875

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for Round 7. Under the current inflation, every dollar you receive is worth only about 0.7351 of its face value. That means if you accept this offer, you get an effective value of roughly 0.7351×7483 ≈ $5500. If you reject and wait for Round 8, your discount factor will drop further—to about 0.6983—so you’d have to work much harder to secure even this effective amount. In light of that, I propose that I take $2517 and you get $7483, which fairly reflects your fallback position and protects you against further loss. I believe this is a reasonable and mutually beneficial deal, so let’s finalize the agreement now before the clock works against us. 
# Bob gain: 7483.0 
# Alice gain: 2517.0

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal for Round 9. Under the current inflation, every dollar you receive is now worth about 66¢ of its face value. That means if you accept, the $6800 allocated to you will be worth roughly $4489 in real terms. If you reject and wait for Round 10, you’ll be in the proposer’s seat, but further depreciation will likely push your effective payoff even lower. Given that waiting only hurts your eventual outcome, I believe this split – $3200 for me and $6800 for you nominally – is fair and aligns with your continuation value. Let’s settle now to avoid additional losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 6800 
# Alice gain: 3200

Round 11
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.13% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal for Round 11. Given our inflation situation, every dollar you receive now is worth roughly 58 cents in real terms. If you reject this offer, you'll be the proposer in Round 12, and even though you could claim nearly the entire $10000 nominally, your eventual effective value would be about $10000 × 0.5711 ≈ $5711. To make you just as well off now as you would be by waiting, I'm offering you a nominal $9840, which at 58 cents per dollar gives you roughly $5707—essentially matching your continuation value. I will receive the remaining $160. This deal secures your share before any further loss of value occurs. I believe this is the most rational split given the circumstances. What do you say?
