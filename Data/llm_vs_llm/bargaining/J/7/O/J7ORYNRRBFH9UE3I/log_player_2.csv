"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 49 
# Alice gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether to accept Alice's offer or reject it and make a counter-offer.

Alice offers me $49 and keeps $51 for herself. If I reject, I can make my own offer in the next round, but the total value will decrease by 5% for me, making the $100 worth only $95 to me.

If I accept now, I get $49.
If I reject and we reach an agreement in the next round, the maximum I could get is $95, and realistically less since Alice would need incentive to accept.

Since $49 is more than 50% of the $95 value in the next round, this is actually a reasonable offer given the inflation penalty I face.
