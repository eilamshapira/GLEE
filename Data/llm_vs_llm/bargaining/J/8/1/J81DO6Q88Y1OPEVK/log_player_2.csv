"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. The offer is a 50-50 split of $1,000,000
2. If I reject, I can make my own offer next round
3. However, due to 20% inflation, in the next round the money will only be worth 80% of its current value for me
4. So if I reject, even if I get 100% in the next round, it would be worth $800,000 to me
5. The current offer of $500,000 is better than a potential $800,000 * 50% = $400,000 in the next round

Given the inflation penalty, this fair split is actually a good deal for me. If I reject, any future negotiations will be with devalued money from my perspective.
