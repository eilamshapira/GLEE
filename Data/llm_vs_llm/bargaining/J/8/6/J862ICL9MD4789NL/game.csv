4500.0,5500.0,I think a more equitable split would be 55/45 in my favor. This actually gives you about the same effective value ($4500 at 5% inflation is worth about $4275) as what I would have received in your offer after factoring in our different inflation rates. This way we both get a fair share.,Bob,2,
