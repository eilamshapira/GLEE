"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more equitable split would be 55/45 in my favor. This actually gives you about the same effective value ($4500 at 5% inflation is worth about $4275) as what I would have received in your offer after factoring in our different inflation rates. This way we both get a fair share. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
