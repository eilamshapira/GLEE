"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Due to the inflation rule, Alice's money will be worth 20% less each round, while mine maintains its value. This means:
- For me: $5000 now = $5000 later
- For Alice: $5000 now > $4000 next round > $3200 third round, etc.

Alice is offering an equal split, but given that time is on my side due to the inflation mechanic, I can likely get a better deal by rejecting and making a counter-offer. Alice will be incentivized to accept a less favorable split later rather than lose more value to inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given the inflation mechanics, I'll propose a split that takes advantage of Alice's deteriorating position while still being reasonable enough that she might accept to avoid further losses.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

This offer gives me 60% and Alice 40%. It's better for me than the initial 50-50 split, but not so extreme that Alice would definitely reject it. From Alice's perspective, if she rejects this, her $4000 would be worth only $3200 in the next round due to 20% inflation, so there's pressure to accept now."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 7000 
# Alice gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is an interesting development. Alice is offering me $7000 (70%) and taking $3000 (30%), which is actually better for me than my previous offer. This seems counter-intuitive at first, but there might be a few reasons for this:

1. Alice might be trying to secure a deal quickly because her money is rapidly losing value (already 36% less)
2. This could be a strategic move to end the game before her position weakens further

Since:
- This offer gives me more than I asked for in my previous proposal ($7000 vs $6000)
- The deal is very favorable to me (70%)
- I'm guaranteed to get the full $7000 value (no inflation for me)
- There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer later
