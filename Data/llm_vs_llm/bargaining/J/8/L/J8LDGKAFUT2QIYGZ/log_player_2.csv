"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's divide 60/40. I think this is fair given the circumstances and our ongoing collaboration. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me 400,000$
2. If I reject and propose in the next round, the money will be worth 10% less to me
3. That means in the next round, I can at most get 900,000$ in value (equivalent to 360,000$ from this round)
4. Even if I make a more aggressive proposal next round, Alice might reject it, leading to further rounds and more value loss for me
5. 400,000$ right now is better than a risky attempt to get more in future rounds with diminishing value
