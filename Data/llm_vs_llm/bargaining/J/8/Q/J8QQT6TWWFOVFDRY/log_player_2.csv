"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair and simple division. I'll take 90% and you can have 10%. It's a good starting point, and we can adjust later if needed. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is clearly not a fair division at all. As Bob, I'll make a more reasonable counter-offer in the next round. Even with the 10% inflation penalty for the next round, I can still propose a much better split for myself."
