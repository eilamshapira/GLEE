"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because if you reject, the money will be worth less to you next round due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I recognize that if you wait until round 3 you’ll have the power to propose a division where you keep virtually the entire $10000 since my share gets discounted further. To avoid any additional delay and my own loss in value due to inflation, I’m offering you the entire $10000 right now. I believe this is the best outcome for you as well. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
