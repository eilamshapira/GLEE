"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because if you reject, the money will be worth less to you next round due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 0, ""alice_gain"": 10000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I recognize that if you wait until round 3 you’ll have the power to propose a division where you keep virtually the entire $10,000 since my share gets discounted further. To avoid any additional delay and my own loss in value due to inflation, I’m offering you the entire $10,000 right now. I believe this is the best outcome for you as well. What do you say?""}"
