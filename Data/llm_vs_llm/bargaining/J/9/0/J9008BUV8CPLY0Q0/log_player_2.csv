"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, let's start with this proposal: I take $60 and you take $40. This way, we can secure a decent amount early on before inflation reduces our share. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Let's split it more fairly, considering the inflation risk. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor, as I'm taking the risk of making the counteroffer. What are your thoughts?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your perspective, Bob. Let's aim for an equal split this time: $50 each. This ensures we're both benefiting equally despite the inflation. How does this sound to you? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 19% less, the actual value of $50 for me would be approximately $50 * 0.81 = $40.50. Considering this, an equal split might not be as favorable as it seems.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth even less now. The total value of the money has decreased by 19% for me and 36% for Alice. 

To make a fair offer, I'll consider the decreased value. Since Alice's share is decreasing more rapidly, I'll try to make a more generous offer to incentivize her to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 42, 
""alice_gain"": 58, 
""message"": ""Let's make a deal before the inflation eats away too much of our share. I'm willing to give you a slightly larger portion, considering your share is decreasing more rapidly. What do you think of a 42-58 split?""}"
