"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split to start the negotiation, offering slightly more to Bob to encourage acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 480000, ""bob_gain"": 520000}

I propose you receive $480,000, and I receive $520,000. This is a fair division that gives Bob a slight advantage to incentivize accepting the offer early."
