"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Based on a subgame‐perfect analysis of the alternating offer game with discounting only on my (Alice’s) side (10% per round) and Bob being fully patient, the backward induction reasoning shows that if Bob rejects any round‑1 proposal, he will become the proposer in round 2 and can leave me (who suffers a discount penalty with each delay) virtually nothing. In other words, Bob’s “threat point” is essentially the entire $10,000. Therefore, to have Bob accept in round 1, I must offer him his full continuation value—which leaves me nothing.

Thus, my equilibrium offer in round 1 is to propose giving me $0 and Bob $10,000. (Any offer giving Bob less would lead him, acting rationally, to reject in favor of proposing later and capturing nearly the whole pie.)

Here is my response in the requested JSON format:

{""alice_gain"": 0, ""bob_gain"": 10000}"
