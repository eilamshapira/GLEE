"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I propose this split because:
- Due to 20% inflation for me, I need to secure a larger portion now
- It still leaves Alice with a substantial amount
- It's more equitable than her initial low-ball offer"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
- With 36% inflation, my $350,000 would be worth effectively $224,000
- If I reject and we go another round, I'll face 48.8% inflation (1 - 0.8^4)
- Any amount I get will be worth significantly less in the next round
- Alice's current offer is much more reasonable than her first offer
- While not ideal, this is probably the best realistic outcome considering the inflation penalty
