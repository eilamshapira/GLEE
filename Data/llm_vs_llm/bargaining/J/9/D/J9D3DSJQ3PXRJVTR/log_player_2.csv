"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a fair offer from Alice. She's proposing an even 50-50 split where we each get $5,000. Since we're facing 5% inflation with each round, accepting now maximizes our collective payout. If I reject, the total amount will decrease to $9,500 in the next round, meaning even if I got a larger percentage then, the absolute amount might be less than $5,000.
