"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: I get $30, Alice gets $70
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to inflation:
   - For me: Money will be worth 5% less
   - For Alice: Money will be worth 20% less

Since Alice's inflation rate (20%) is much higher than mine (5%), I have leverage in negotiations. If I reject, the $100 will be worth less to Alice in the next round, which should make her more willing to accept a better deal for me.

I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll make a strategic counter-offer considering our different inflation rates:

1. For Alice, the money is now worth 20% less, so she should be more willing to accept a lower amount
2. For me, the money is only worth 5% less, so I still have strong negotiating power
3. I should offer Alice enough to make it worth accepting rather than continuing to the next round where inflation will hurt her even more

I'll propose a more balanced split that favors me but isn't so extreme that Alice would definitely reject it:

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

This offer gives me a good portion while still leaving Alice with enough that she might accept rather than risk further devaluation of her share."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Current offer: $45 for me, $55 for Alice
2. With inflation:
   - My $45 is worth about $40.61 (9.75% less than round 1 value)
   - Alice's $55 is worth only $35.20 (36% less than round 1 value)
3. If I reject:
   - Next round my inflation will be around 15% from original
   - Alice's inflation will be around 56% from original
   - This means the money will be worth significantly less for both of us, but especially for Alice

This is actually a reasonable offer considering:
- It's better than the initial offer of $30
- The real value isn't dropping too much for me yet
- Further negotiation might lead to worse outcomes due to compounding inflation
- Alice is already taking a significant hit due to her higher inflation rate
