"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Alice in each round, I'll take that into account for my offer.

For me (Bob), the $100 is now worth $95 (100 - 5% of 100).
For Alice, the $100 is now worth $80 (100 - 20% of 100).

Considering this, I'll make my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll calculate the actual value of the offer:

For me (Bob), the $45 is worth approximately $40.58 (45 * (1 - 0.0975)).
For Alice, the $55 is worth approximately $35.20 (55 * (1 - 0.36)).

Given this, I'll make my decision:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
