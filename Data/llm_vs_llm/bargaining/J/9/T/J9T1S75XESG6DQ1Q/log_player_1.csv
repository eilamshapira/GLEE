"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for Round 1, taking into account the inflation that will affect me in later rounds if we don't reach an agreement:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering myself $60 and Bob $40. I am doing this because I am considering the time value of money. If Bob rejects this offer, the value of money for Alice decreases, so I am making an offer that is more beneficial to me now."
