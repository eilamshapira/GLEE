"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. I'm being offered $40 out of $100
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, in the next round the money will be worth less to me
4. $40 now is better than $42.11 in the next round (because $42.11 after 5% inflation is worth $40)

While 40/60 split isn't exactly equal, it's a reasonable offer considering:
- I avoid inflation loss by accepting now
- The difference isn't large enough to risk a rejection and counter-offer
- There's no guarantee Alice would accept a better offer from me
