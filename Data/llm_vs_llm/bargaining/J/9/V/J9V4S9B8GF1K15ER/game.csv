500000.0,500000.0,"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think an equal 50-50 split would be most fair since we're both essential to this agreement. This gives us each $500000, which is a significant amount. Since inflation doesn't affect me, I'm comfortable negotiating, but I believe this even split respects both our interests equally.",Bob,2,
