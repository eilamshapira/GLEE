"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's make this quick and fair. I'm offering you a generous 40% share. With inflation affecting future rounds, this is a good deal for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think an equal 50-50 split would be most fair since we're both essential to this agreement. This gives us each $500000, which is a significant amount. Since inflation doesn't affect me, I'm comfortable negotiating, but I believe this even split respects both our interests equally. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Due to 20% inflation, if I accept Bob's offer of $500,000, it would actually be worth $400,000 to me in round 1 terms.

In the next round, I could make another offer, but any amount I receive would be worth another 20% less (worth only 60% of round 1 value). This means I'd need to secure a significantly higher nominal amount just to match what I can get now.

Given that Bob isn't affected by inflation and can comfortably wait, and that my negotiating position weakens with each round due to inflation, $500,000 (worth $400,000 to me) is actually a reasonable offer in this context.
