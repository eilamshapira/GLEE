"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make this quick and fair. I'm offering you a generous 40% share. With inflation affecting future rounds, this is a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if 40% is fair in this negotiation, especially when we're starting from scratch with no established baseline.

Alice is offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000, keeping $600,000 for herself. She mentions inflation affecting future rounds, but the instructions state that inflation is 0% for me, so delaying doesn't hurt my position.

Since there's no time pressure on my side, I can reject this offer and make my own proposal in the next round, potentially for a more even split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while being reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think an equal 50-50 split would be most fair since we're both essential to this agreement. This gives us each $500,000, which is a significant amount. Since inflation doesn't affect me, I'm comfortable negotiating, but I believe this even split respects both our interests equally.""}"
