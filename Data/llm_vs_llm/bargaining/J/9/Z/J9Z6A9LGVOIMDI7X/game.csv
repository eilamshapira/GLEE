55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob! I'd like to propose a fair split where I get $55 and you get $45. Since I'm facing 20% inflation each round, I need a slightly higher amount to offset my future losses. If we don't agree quickly, we both lose value.",Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your situation with inflation, but I'm also facing significant inflation at 5% per round. I propose $55 for me and $45 for you, which I believe is fair given our respective inflation rates. Let's settle this quickly to minimize our losses.",Bob,2,

60.0,40.0,"Bob, I appreciate your counterproposal, but my inflation rate is 20% per round while yours is only 5%. This significant difference means I lose much more value with each passing round. I'm proposing $60 for me and $40 for you to account for this disparity. Let's reach an agreement soon so we both walk away with meaningful value.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
50.0,50.0,"Alice, I understand your inflation concerns, but mine are also significant at 5% per round. To find a middle ground, I propose an even split of $50 for each of us. This way, we both get a fair share considering our different rates of inflation. Let's agree on this to end the game soon and preserve as much value as possible.",Bob,4,
