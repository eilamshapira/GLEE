"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'd like to propose a fair split where I get $55 and you get $45. Since I'm facing 20% inflation each round, I need a slightly higher amount to offset my future losses. If we don't agree quickly, we both lose value. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your situation with inflation, but I'm also facing significant inflation at 5% per round. I propose $55 for me and $45 for you, which I believe is fair given our respective inflation rates. Let's settle this quickly to minimize our losses.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counterproposal, but my inflation rate is 20% per round while yours is only 5%. This significant difference means I lose much more value with each passing round. I'm proposing $60 for me and $40 for you to account for this disparity. Let's reach an agreement soon so we both walk away with meaningful value. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your inflation concerns, but mine are also significant at 5% per round. To find a middle ground, I propose an even split of $50 for each of us. This way, we both get a fair share considering our different rates of inflation. Let's agree on this to end the game soon and preserve as much value as possible.""
