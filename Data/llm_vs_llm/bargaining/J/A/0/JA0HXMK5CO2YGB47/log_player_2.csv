"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and square! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

If I reject this offer, I can make a counter-proposal next round, but:
1. The money will be worth 5% less due to inflation
2. Alice could reject my proposal, leading to further rounds and more value loss
3. The current offer of $5000 is objectively fair

Even if I tried to negotiate for more in the next round, 5% inflation means the total pot would effectively be worth $9500 to me. Any marginal gain would be offset by this loss.

The 50-50 split is fair and avoiding inflation is valuable, so:
