600000.0,400000.0,"I propose a 60-40 split in my favor to compensate for my inflation penalty. This is fair since your money won't lose value over time, while mine will.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"My offer is more balanced, considering the inflation penalty you'll face in subsequent rounds. It's in your best interest to accept this proposal to maximize your value.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Let's be reasonable. With 10% total inflation penalty on my side so far, this split actually gives me $495000 in real value while you get $450000. It's nearly equal in practice and fair for both of us.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Considering the increasing inflation penalty on your side, this offer is generous. The value of your share will continue to decrease with each round, making this a favorable deal for you.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
525000.0,475000.0,"Let's end this now. With my 18.95% total inflation penalty, this split gives me about $425500 in real value while you get $475000. It's very close to a 47-53 split in real terms. If we continue, inflation will hurt both our interests.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"The inflation penalty on your side is significant now. This offer still gives you a substantial share, but it's in your best interest to accept soon, as further rounds will drastically reduce the value of your potential earnings.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
575000.0,425000.0,"Bob, with my 26.95% inflation penalty, this offer actually gives me $420000 in real value while you get $425000. It's practically a 50-50 split in real terms. We're both losing value by continuing - let's make a deal now.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"Alice, your inflation penalty is now quite significant. This offer is still better for you than walking away with nothing, which will happen if we don't reach an agreement within the remaining rounds. It's time to be realistic about the value of your share.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, with my 33.91% inflation penalty, this split gives me $429585 in real value while you get $350000. We only have 3 rounds left. If we don't agree soon, we both get nothing. This is a fair deal - let's end this now.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
250000.0,750000.0,"Alice, time is running out, and your inflation penalty is severely impacting your potential earnings. This offer is more than generous considering the circumstances. If you don't accept, the next round might be too late for a reasonable deal.",Bob,10,
