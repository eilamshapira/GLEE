"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split in my favor to compensate for my inflation penalty. This is fair since your money won't lose value over time, while mine will.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My offer is more balanced, considering the inflation penalty you'll face in subsequent rounds. It's in your best interest to accept this proposal to maximize your value. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The inflation penalty makes this offer less attractive for me. With 5% inflation, my $450,000 is actually worth $427,500, while Bob's $550,000 maintains full value. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. With 10% total inflation penalty on my side so far, this split actually gives me $495,000 in real value while you get $450,000. It's nearly equal in practice and fair for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the increasing inflation penalty on your side, this offer is generous. The value of your share will continue to decrease with each round, making this a favorable deal for you. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

With the 14.26% inflation penalty, my $400,000 would only be worth about $343,000 in real value, while Bob gets $600,000 at full value. This is too unbalanced. I'll make a better counter-offer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Let's end this now. With my 18.95% total inflation penalty, this split gives me about $425,500 in real value while you get $475,000. It's very close to a 47-53 split in real terms. If we continue, inflation will hurt both our interests.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The inflation penalty on your side is significant now. This offer still gives you a substantial share, but it's in your best interest to accept soon, as further rounds will drastically reduce the value of your potential earnings. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

With 22.62% inflation penalty, the $350,000 would only be worth about $270,830 in real value, while Bob gets $650,000 at full value. This is becoming increasingly unfair. While Bob is right about the inflation penalty, this split is too extreme. I'll make another counter-offer that better accounts for both our interests."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 575000, ""bob_gain"": 425000, ""message"": ""Bob, with my 26.95% inflation penalty, this offer actually gives me $420,000 in real value while you get $425,000. It's practically a 50-50 split in real terms. We're both losing value by continuing - let's make a deal now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your inflation penalty is now quite significant. This offer is still better for you than walking away with nothing, which will happen if we don't reach an agreement within the remaining rounds. It's time to be realistic about the value of your share. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

With 30.17% inflation penalty, the $300,000 would only be worth about $209,490 in real value, while Bob gets $700,000 at full value. Even considering the risk of getting nothing, this is too unbalanced. I'll make one more reasonable counter-offer, as we're running out of rounds and both risking getting nothing."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Bob, with my 33.91% inflation penalty, this split gives me $429,585 in real value while you get $350,000. We only have 3 rounds left. If we don't agree soon, we both get nothing. This is a fair deal - let's end this now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, time is running out, and your inflation penalty is severely impacting your potential earnings. This offer is more than generous considering the circumstances. If you don't accept, the next round might be too late for a reasonable deal. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. With the 36.98% inflation penalty, my $250,000 is worth about $157,550 in real value. While this isn't ideal, we only have two rounds left, and the risk of getting nothing is becoming too high. Further negotiation would lead to even worse outcomes due to increasing inflation, and Bob might make even less favorable offers in the remaining rounds knowing my weakened position."
