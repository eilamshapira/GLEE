Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think your initial offer was a bit one-sided. Considering the inflation risk, I'm willing to take a slightly larger share to secure my part, but still offer you a substantial amount. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
""decision"": ""accept""
}

I'll accept Bob's offer because:
1. The value is already declining due to inflation (my $475,000 is worth $427,500 after 10% inflation)
2. Continuing to negotiate would mean further value loss
3. The split is reasonably fair, close to 50-50
4. There's risk in continuing negotiations as we only have 12 rounds total
It's better to secure a good deal now than risk further depreciation or potential deadlock."
