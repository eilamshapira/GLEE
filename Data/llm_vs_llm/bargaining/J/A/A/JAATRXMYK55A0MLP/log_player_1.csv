"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me think strategically about this. Since Bob loses 10% value each round, I can use this to my advantage. However, I want to make a reasonable first offer that has a good chance of being accepted.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose taking $6,000 for myself and giving $4,000 to Bob. This is a 60-40 split which, while in my favor, still gives Bob a significant portion. If Bob rejects this, the money will be worth less to him in the next round, while maintaining full value for me."
