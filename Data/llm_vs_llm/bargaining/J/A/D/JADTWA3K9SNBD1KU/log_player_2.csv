Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for round 2, taking into account the inflation that has impacted the value of the money for me:

The money is worth 20% less for me now, meaning my share is worth 80% of its original value.

Here's the offer:

```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""alice_gain"": 600000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for round 4, considering the accumulated inflation:

*   **My inflation:** The money is now worth 48.8% less than in round 1 (20% in round 2, then 20% of the remaining value in round 3). This means my share is worth 51.2% of its original value.
*   **Alice's inflation:** The money is now worth 14.26% less than in round 1 (5% in round 2, then 5% of the remaining value in round 3). This means her share is worth 85.74% of its original value.

I need to get a larger share this time. Here's the offer:

```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""alice_gain"": 450000
}

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for round 6, factoring in the continued inflation:

*   **My inflation:** The money is now worth 67.232% less than in round 1 (20% in rounds 2-5). This means my share is worth 32.768% of its original value.
*   **Alice's inflation:** The money is now worth 22.62% less than in round 1 (5% in rounds 2-5). This means her share is worth 77.38% of its original value.

I need to make a much stronger offer to compensate for the decreased value.

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for round 8, taking into account the inflation:

*   **My inflation:** The money is now worth 79.032% less than in round 1. (20% in rounds 2-7). This means my share is worth 20.968% of its original value.
*   **Alice's inflation:** The money is now worth 29.86% less than in round 1 (5% in rounds 2-7). This means her share is worth 70.14% of its original value.

Given the diminishing value of the money for me, I have to make an offer that still gives me a decent share in terms of the relative value.

  ""bob_gain"": 650000,
  ""alice_gain"": 350000

Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Alright, here's my offer for round 10, accounting for the ongoing inflation:

*   **My inflation:** The money is now worth approximately 86.576% less than in round 1. (20% in rounds 2-9).  My share is worth about 13.424% of its original value.
*   **Alice's inflation:** The money is now worth approximately 37.08% less than in round 1 (5% in rounds 2-9).  Her share is worth about 62.92% of its original value.

Given the significant inflation affecting me, I need to secure a considerable portion of the remaining value.

Round 12
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, this is the final round. Both of our shares have been significantly impacted by inflation.

*   **My inflation:** The money is now worth approximately 91.41% less than in round 1 (20% in rounds 2-11). My share is worth about 8.59% of its original value.
*   **Alice's inflation:** The money is now worth approximately 42.88% less than in round 1 (5% in rounds 2-11). Her share is worth about 57.12% of its original value.

Given that this is the last round and we both get nothing if we don't agree, I'll make an offer designed to secure something for myself, even if it's a smaller amount. I'll also try to make it seem ""fair"" to Alice, but the real goal is to get more.

  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""alice_gain"": 450000
