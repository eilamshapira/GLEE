Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's go for an equal split this time. $5000 for you and $5000 for me. It's fair considering the inflation effect from last round. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
