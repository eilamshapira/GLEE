"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

At $40, this isn't a terrible first offer, but I can likely do better. If I reject, I get to make the next proposal. While there is a 20% depreciation for me (and 10% for Alice) per round, I still have many rounds left.

In the next round:
- The $100 will be worth $80 for me (20% less)
- The $100 will be worth $90 for Alice (10% less)

I can make a counter-proposal that could be more favorable while still being acceptable to Alice, given the depreciation she faces.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a strategic offer. Since money is worth less for both of us now (80% value for me, 90% for Alice), I need to propose something that's attractive enough for Alice to accept while maximizing my gain.

I'll propose a slightly more favorable split for myself, but not too aggressive to avoid multiple rounds of depreciation.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I propose this split because:
1. It gives me a better share than Alice's initial offer
2. For Alice, 45$ at 90% value (40.5$) is still substantial
3. If she rejects, she'll face further 10% depreciation in the next round
4. The split is close enough to 50-50 to be considered fair"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. If I accept this offer:
   * I get $42, but it's worth 36% less, so effectively worth $26.88
   * This is less than her initial offer of $40 in round 1

2. If I reject:
   * Next round the money will be worth 56% less for me (losing another 20%)
   * I'll have another chance to make an offer, but the depreciation is getting serious
   * Alice's money will only be worth 29% less (losing another 10%)

3. The depreciation is starting to significantly impact both of us, and we're only in round 3 of 12

Given that the depreciation is accelerating and Alice seems to be holding firm around the 40:60 split range, I should probably accept this offer before the value decreases further for both of us.
