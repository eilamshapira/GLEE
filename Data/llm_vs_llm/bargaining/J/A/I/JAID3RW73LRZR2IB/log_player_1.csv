"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a reasonably favorable but not too aggressive offer, considering we have multiple rounds and inflation will affect my gains if Bob refuses.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which gives Bob a substantial portion while still maintaining a good outcome for myself. This offer acknowledges Bob's position while trying to secure a better deal for me. If Bob refuses, my next potential gain will be affected by 5% inflation, so this is a serious offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept now:
   * I get $450,000 (worth 95% of original value = $427,500 effective value)
   * Bob gets $550,000 (worth 90% of original value)

2. If I reject:
   * Next round my money will be worth another 5% less
   * I'll have to make a new offer
   * Bob might reject again, leading to further inflation
   * We're already in round 2 of 12, so there's still time

$427,500 is significantly less than my initial proposal would have given me. Given that we still have many rounds left and the current offer gives Bob a larger share while giving me a diminished value, I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate better terms.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that Bob rejected my first 60-40 split and countered with a 45-55 split in his favor, I'll adjust my offer to be more appealing while still maintaining a good position for myself. I need to consider that my gains are now worth 10% less than in round 1 due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing a more moderate 55-45 split in my favor. This is a significant concession from my initial offer and moves closer to Bob's proposal, while still giving me a slight advantage. Considering inflation, I need to secure a decent amount, but I also need to make the offer attractive enough to avoid further rounds where inflation will continue to eat into my gains."
