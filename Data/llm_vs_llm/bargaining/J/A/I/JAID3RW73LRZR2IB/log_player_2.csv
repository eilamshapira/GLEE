"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 1M$ to split, Alice is offering me 400,000$ while taking 600,000$ for herself.
If I reject, the money will be worth 10% less next round when I make an offer.
400,000$ now is better than a higher nominal amount that's worth less due to inflation.

However, since I'm first to respond and there are still many rounds left, I think I can get a better deal. Even with 10% inflation, I could propose a more favorable split next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll now make a counter-proposal. I need to be strategic considering:
1. The money is now worth 10% less to me
2. Alice might reject if I'm too greedy
3. There are still 10 rounds left if this gets rejected

I'll propose a more balanced split, slightly in my favor:

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000}

This is a fair offer that gives me a modest advantage while still being reasonable enough that Alice might accept it. Even with the 10% inflation I'm experiencing, this is better than her initial offer to me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice is offering me 450,000$, but due to 19% inflation, it's effectively worth about 364,500$ to me
2. This is better than her first offer (400,000$), even accounting for inflation
3. If I reject, the next round will have even higher inflation (29% for me)
4. There are still 9 rounds left, but the inflation penalty is getting significant

Since Alice increased her offer from the first round, and the inflation is starting to seriously impact my potential gains, I think it's wise to accept this offer. Waiting longer will only decrease the real value of any money I receive.
