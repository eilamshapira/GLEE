"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my offer for Round 1.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing a fair division that gives Bob a substantial portion of the money. This gives us both a good outcome, with me getting slightly more since you mentioned that Bob faces a 10% inflation penalty with each round. If we don't agree now, both of us risk getting less value from future negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000}

I'm making a new offer that still gives Bob a significant portion while acknowledging our negotiation situation. Since Bob faces 10% inflation with each round, it's in his interest to reach an agreement soon. This offer provides Bob with substantial value now rather than risking further depreciation of his share in future rounds."
