"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split while considering that Bob might reject unfair offers, and we both lose value due to inflation if we delay.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because while I aim to maximize my gain, offering too little to Bob would likely lead to rejection and a counter-offer in the next round, where the total amount would be worth 20% less. This offer gives me a slight advantage while still being reasonable enough that Bob might accept it to avoid inflation losses."
