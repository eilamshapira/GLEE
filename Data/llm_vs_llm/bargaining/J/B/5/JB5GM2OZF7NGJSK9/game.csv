50.0,50.0,"Hi Bob! I propose an equal split of the money, which seems fair to both of us. Since inflation doesn't affect me, we can resolve this quickly and both walk away happy with $50 each.",Alice,1,

40.0,60.0,"Hi Alice, I think I deserve a bit more since I'm the one affected by inflation. Let's settle on 60-40 and call it a day before the money loses more value.",Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about inflation, but I'm affected by opportunity cost as well. Let's meet in the middle with a 55-45 split in my favor. This is still a fair deal considering we started at 50-50, and you requested 60-40 in your favor. If we continue rejecting offers, inflation will hurt you more, so this is a reasonable compromise.",Alice,3,

43.0,57.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think I'm taking on more risk with inflation. I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle, but I need a bit more to offset the loss in value. Let's try 57-43 and see if we can settle this before the money loses even more value.",Bob,4,

53.0,47.0,"Bob, let's be practical here. The inflation is affecting your gains significantly now (over 27%), and it will only get worse if we continue. I'm offering you a better deal than before - 47 for you and 53 for me. This is a fair compromise between our last positions. If we don't agree soon, inflation will continue to reduce your actual gains no matter what percentage you get. Let's end this efficiently and both walk away with something valuable.",Alice,5,
