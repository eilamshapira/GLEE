"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I propose an equal split of the money, which seems fair to both of us. Since inflation doesn't affect me, we can resolve this quickly and both walk away happy with $50 each. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, 
""alice_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I think I deserve a bit more since I'm the one affected by inflation. Let's settle on 60-40 and call it a day before the money loses more value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concern about inflation, but I'm affected by opportunity cost as well. Let's meet in the middle with a 55-45 split in my favor. This is still a fair deal considering we started at 50-50, and you requested 60-40 in your favor. If we continue rejecting offers, inflation will hurt you more, so this is a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 57, 
""alice_gain"": 43, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think I'm taking on more risk with inflation. I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle, but I need a bit more to offset the loss in value. Let's try 57-43 and see if we can settle this before the money loses even more value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical here. The inflation is affecting your gains significantly now (over 27%), and it will only get worse if we continue. I'm offering you a better deal than before - 47 for you and 53 for me. This is a fair compromise between our last positions. If we don't agree soon, inflation will continue to reduce your actual gains no matter what percentage you get. Let's end this efficiently and both walk away with something valuable. 
# Bob gain: 47 
# Alice gain: 53
