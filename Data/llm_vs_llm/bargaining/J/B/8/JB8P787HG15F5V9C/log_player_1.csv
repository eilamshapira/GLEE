"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I see Bob's offer.

Given the inflation, my $5000 is now worth significantly less. However, if I reject, I will make a proposal in the next round with the money having even less value. Let's analyze this and proceed with a decision.

My current value is $10,000 - 20% = $8000. So the $5000 in this round is worth $5000/$8000 * 100% = 62.5%

I will accept.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
