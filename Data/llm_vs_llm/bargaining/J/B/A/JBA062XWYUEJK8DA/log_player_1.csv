Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation affecting my share, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor this round. Let's find a fair deal quickly. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is the same as mine, just flipped in his favor.  Since I don't know how inflation is affecting him, it's too risky to accept an offer where I get significantly less. I need to counter with something that encourages a quicker agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, inflation is hitting me hard, and we're running out of time. Let's settle on a 55-45 split in my favor to end this quickly before we lose more value. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough one, but it's better to accept than risk getting even less with the increasing inflation. It seems Bob is also affected by it, even if we don't know to what extent.  This is the best I'm likely to get at this point."
