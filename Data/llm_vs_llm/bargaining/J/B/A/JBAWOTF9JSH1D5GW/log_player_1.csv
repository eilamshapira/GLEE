Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

Explanation: I offer Bob $40, keeping $60 for myself. This is a reasonable starting offer considering the impact of inflation on my share in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
