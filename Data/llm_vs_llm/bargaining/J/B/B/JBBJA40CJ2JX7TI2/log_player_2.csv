"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share, let's end this! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $40 while taking $60
2. If I reject, we'll move to round 2, where:
   - My money will be worth 10% less
   - Her money will be worth 5% less
   - I'll get to make the next offer

While this isn't a 50-50 split, if I reject, any future gains will be worth less due to inflation. However, the split seems too unfavorable to accept immediately. I believe I can make a better counter-offer in the next round, even accounting for the inflation penalty.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a strategic offer:

The money is now worth:
- For me: 90% of original value
- For Alice: 95% of original value

I'll propose a more balanced split, but considering inflation, I need to account for the reduced value.

{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""A more balanced split considering we've both lost some value due to inflation. This is fair for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is the best I can do. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $42, but due to 19% inflation, it's actually worth about $34
2. She's taking $58, which for her is worth about $52.3 due to her 9.75% inflation
3. If I reject:
   - Next round my money will be worth 29% less
   - Her money will be worth 14.75% less
   - I can make another offer, but the value keeps decreasing
4. We've already gone through 3 rounds, and we only have 9 left
5. The offer is slightly better than her first offer ($40), showing some willingness to negotiate

While I might get a better nominal amount by continuing, the inflation penalty is getting significant. This offer, while not ideal, is better than her first one, and continuing would mean both of us lose more value.
