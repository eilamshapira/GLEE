"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 8312.35 
# Alice gain: 1687.65 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether I should accept this offer, I need to consider the value of the money in the current round and the potential decrease in value in subsequent rounds.

Given that the money is worth 5% less for me with each passing round, and 20% less for Alice, I should evaluate if the proposed split is favorable considering these depreciation rates.

In this round, Alice offers me $8,312.35 and herself $1,687.65. This seems to favor me significantly. However, I must consider the potential outcomes of rejecting this offer and proceeding to the next round, where I would make the proposal.

Since the offer significantly favors me and considering the high depreciation rate for Alice, which would further reduce her potential gain in subsequent rounds, it might be beneficial to accept this offer to secure a substantial amount for myself.
