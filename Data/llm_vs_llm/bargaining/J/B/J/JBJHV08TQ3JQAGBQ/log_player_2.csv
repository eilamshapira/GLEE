"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose to take $60 and you take $40. This is a fair split considering the risk of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 20% inflation, any amount I get next round will be worth 20% less to me
4. If I get $50 next round, it would actually be worth $40 (same as current offer)
5. Getting more than $50 accepted by Alice might be difficult

Since getting a significantly better deal next round would be challenging due to inflation, and Alice's offer is reasonable...
