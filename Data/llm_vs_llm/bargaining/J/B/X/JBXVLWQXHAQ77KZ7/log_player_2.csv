Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your perspective on an even split. Given the inflation affecting us, let's try $480000 for me and $520000 for you. This still offers a fair division while considering our respective preferences. I hope we can agree on this and close the deal amicably! 
# Bob gain: 520000 
# Alice gain: 480000
