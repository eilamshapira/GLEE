"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, as it's the first round and we need to establish trust.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

This is a fair 50-50 split of the money. I believe this equal division respects both parties and has a high chance of being accepted."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Bob wants $600,000, but due to 20% inflation on his side, it's actually worth $480,000 to him
2. He's offering me $400,000, which has no inflation effect for me
3. While this is less than my initial 50-50 offer, it's not terribly unfair given the inflation effect on his side
4. If I reject, we move to the next round where inflation will be even worse for Bob

Given these factors, I'll accept the offer. Getting $400,000 now is better than risking further negotiations where both parties might end up with nothing.
