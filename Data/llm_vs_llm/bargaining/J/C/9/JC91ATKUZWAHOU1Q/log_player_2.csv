"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it equally for a fair start. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer, considering the 5% inflation devaluation per round if I reject it.

If I accept now, I get $500,000.

If I reject and propose in round 2, I'd likely aim for more, but the total would be worth 5% less to me. So round 2 money would be worth 95% of round 1 money.

Given the equal split offers me half immediately, and the uncertainty of getting significantly more in future rounds (especially with continuing inflation penalties), this seems reasonable.
