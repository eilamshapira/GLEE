"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze the offer and the implications of rejecting it.

Currently, Alice offers me $400,000.

If I reject, the money's worth decreases. For me, it becomes 80% of the original value. For Alice, it becomes 95%.

In round 2, I will make a proposal. I need to factor in that Alice will only accept a proposal that gives her at least as much utility as she would get by accepting the current offer. The equivalent value of $600,000 for her in the next round would be $600,000 * (1/0.95) = $631,578.95. This means she won't accept anything less than that. Furthermore, after the second round of decrease, I will only have 80% x 80% = 64% of the original value. The total value is now worth $1,000,000 * 0.8 * 0.95 = 760,000$ from my point of view.

Therefore, rejecting and making the offer in round 2 is not better than accepting this offer.
