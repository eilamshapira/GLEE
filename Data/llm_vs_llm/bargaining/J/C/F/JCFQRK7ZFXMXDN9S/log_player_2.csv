"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose to take $60 and leave $40 for you. This is a fair split considering the inflation rates affecting us differently. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully given the inflation rates.

If I accept now, I get $40.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me, meaning the entire $100 would only be worth $80 to me. Even if I could get more dollars in the next round, I need to account for this significant loss of value.

For Alice, the inflation is only 5%, so she's not as pressured to settle immediately.

Given that I face much higher inflation, getting $40 now is likely better than trying to negotiate for more in subsequent rounds where the total value keeps decreasing substantially for me.
