"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. This is the first round, so there's no inflation effect yet
2. Alice is offering me 4000$ (40% of the total)
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but:
   - The money will be worth 20% less to me
   - Alice's acceptance will depend on her own inflation rate
4. 4000$ now is better than 5000$ next round (which would be worth 4000$ to me due to inflation)
5. While I could try to negotiate for more, the risk of further inflation and potential rejection makes this a reasonable offer
