"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40 in my favor. It's a fair start considering the negotiation advantage of going first. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

If I reject this offer, I'll make the next proposal, but the money will be worth 20% less for me, meaning the $1M will effectively be worth $800K from my perspective.

The current offer gives me $400K, which is better than what I might get after several rounds of back-and-forth where inflation keeps eating into my share.

While a 50-50 split might seem more fair, 40% of the full amount now is better than risking further negotiations where inflation will reduce my real gains.
