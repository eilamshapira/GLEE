"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a fair and reasonable offer to establish good faith negotiation.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

This is a fair 50-50 split, acknowledging both our equal positions in this negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 
Bob's offer gives them $60 (though worth 5% less to them due to inflation) and gives me $40.
This is less favorable than my initial 50-50 split. Since I know:
1. I'm not affected by inflation
2. We still have 10 rounds left
3. Bob is affected by inflation (5% per round)

I believe I can get a better deal by continuing negotiation. Bob's money will be worth less each round, which may make them more willing to accept a better offer for me in later rounds.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob has shown they're looking for a larger share but their value is decreasing due to inflation, I'll make a strategic offer that's slightly better than my first one for me, but still reasonable.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm offering this split because:
1. It's still fairly balanced
2. Bob's previous offer showed they're willing to consider uneven splits
3. With increasing inflation affecting Bob's gains, they might be more inclined to accept a smaller amount now rather than risk further devaluation"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
1. Bob is now offering me $45, which is better than their previous offer of $40
2. They're asking for $55, but it's worth 14.26% less to them due to inflation
3. Bob seems to be moving towards a more balanced split, likely due to inflation pressure
4. We still have 8 rounds left, and Bob's value will continue to decrease

However, this offer is more reasonable than the previous one, and continuing negotiations too long might risk reaching the 12-round limit where we both get nothing. Still, I believe I can get a better deal given the inflation pressure on Bob.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that Bob has shown movement towards a more balanced split and their money is losing value due to inflation, I'll propose a split that's more favorable to me while still being reasonable enough that they might accept to avoid further inflation losses.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

This offer makes sense because:
1. Bob's money is already worth 14.26% less and will continue to decrease
2. Bob has shown flexibility by improving their previous offer
3. The time pressure of the 12-round limit and continuing inflation might make this more attractive to Bob
4. My gains maintain their value, so I can afford to be more assertive"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
1. Bob is now offering a 50-50 split, which is actually my initial offer
2. Their $50 is worth 22.62% less to them due to inflation
3. My $50 maintains its full value
4. We're halfway through the rounds (6 out of 12)
5. Bob seems to be making increasingly better offers for me as inflation affects them

This is a fair offer, and considering:
- The risk of reaching round 12 with no agreement
- Bob's clear progression toward more balanced offers
- The fact that my $50 maintains full value while Bob's portion is significantly devalued
