I'm still holding out for a better deal. While the inflation is hurting, accepting a deal where I get significantly less than Alice seems unacceptable. I need to make it clear that I'm willing to risk it for a more equitable outcome."

I'm returning to a 50/50 split. This emphasizes fairness, which might be more persuasive to Alice at this stage.  It also sets a clear benchmark if we need to negotiate further under time pressure."
