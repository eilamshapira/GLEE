"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split where I get 55% and you get 45%. This is a reasonable offer considering we both want to conclude this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Alice is offering me 450,000$ (45%)
2. If I reject and we go to next round:
   * The money will be worth 5% less to me
   * Maximum I could propose would be 950,000$ (as next proposer)
   * But Alice might reject, leading to further rounds and more inflation
3. 450,000$ is a substantial amount
4. The split isn't terribly unfair (55/45)
5. Getting a deal now avoids inflation risk

While I could try to negotiate for more, the 5% inflation penalty makes immediate acceptance more attractive. 450,000$ now is better than potentially getting less in future rounds due to inflation.
