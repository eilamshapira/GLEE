"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","For the first round, I'll make a reasonable offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, I want to make a deal quickly. However, I also need to make sure Bob has an incentive to accept.

Here's my offer:
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

This offer gives me a slight majority of the money but still leaves Bob with a significant amount, hopefully enticing him to accept and end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4700 
# Bob gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the inflation rates, the actual values for me and Bob in this round are:

- For me (Alice), the $4700 is worth 20% less than its face value due to inflation, so its real value is $4700 * 0.8 = $3760.
- For Bob, the $5300 is worth 5% less than its face value, but this reduction applies to Bob's perception, not mine. So, I consider the face value for my decision.

Considering Bob's offer gives me $3760 (in real value due to inflation) and him $5300 (face value, as the reduction affects his perception, not the actual amount I consider for my decision), and comparing it to my initial offer, I realize I need to weigh the potential benefits of accepting this offer against the risk of further inflation reducing the value of any future offers.

Given the significant reduction in value for me due to the 20% inflation and the fact that this is only the second round, I might be inclined to reject this offer in hopes of getting a better deal in the next round or forcing Bob into a more favorable split as the game progresses and the value of his potential gains decreases more slowly than mine.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that the game has progressed to Round 3 and considering the inflation rates:

- The money I gain is now worth 20% less than in Round 2, which means it's 20% * 2 = 40% less than in Round 1. So, the value of any amount I receive is multiplied by 0.6 (since 100% - 40% = 60%).
- The money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in Round 2, which means it's 5% * 2 = 10% less than in Round 1. So, the value of any amount Bob receives is multiplied by 0.9 (since 100% - 10% = 90%).

To make an attractive offer to Bob while also considering my own diminishing returns due to inflation, I'll aim for a split that acknowledges Bob's relatively slower loss of value but also pushes for a deal before the inflation further erodes my potential gains.

Here's my offer for Round 3:
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

This offer splits the money evenly, which might be more appealing to Bob given the current inflation rates and the fact that his losses are less severe. For me, accepting a potentially lower real value now might be better than risking further inflation in subsequent rounds."
