"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering the standard first-mover advantage in negotiation games.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the first-mover advantage is now mine and inflation is starting to take effect, I think a 55-45 split is more than fair. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Bob is offering me $45
2. Bob would get $55, but it's worth 10% less to him due to inflation (effectively worth $49.5 to him)
3. If I reject, we go to another round where I can make an offer, but Bob's value will decrease further
4. $45 for me is still a significant portion, and better than risking further negotiations
5. This is actually a reasonable counteroffer to my initial 60-40 split
