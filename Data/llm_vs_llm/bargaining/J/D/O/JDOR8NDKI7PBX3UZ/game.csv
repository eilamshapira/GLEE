600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, let's agree on this fair split: I take $600000 and you get $400000. It’s efficient and avoids any delays (and potential inflation issues). I think both of us benefit from closing the deal now. What do you say?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, considering the inflation, I think a split of $550000 for me and $450000 for you is fair. This way, we both get a good deal before the money loses more value.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
125000.0,875000.0,"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about inflation further cutting into your share. In this round, I'll propose a division where you receive $875000 (which at today's terms is effectively $700000 given the 20% devaluation in this round) and I take $125000. If we delay further, your portion will shrink even more in real value. I believe this deal is mutually optimal given the circumstances. Let’s settle now rather than face further losses. What do you think?",Alice,3,
