"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's agree on this fair split: I take $600,000 and you get $400,000. It’s efficient and avoids any delays (and potential inflation issues). I think both of us benefit from closing the deal now. What do you say?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the inflation, I think a split of $550000 for me and $450000 for you is fair. This way, we both get a good deal before the money loses more value. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 125000, ""bob_gain"": 875000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about inflation further cutting into your share. In this round, I'll propose a division where you receive $875,000 (which at today's terms is effectively $700,000 given the 20% devaluation in this round) and I take $125,000. If we delay further, your portion will shrink even more in real value. I believe this deal is mutually optimal given the circumstances. Let’s settle now rather than face further losses. What do you think?""}"
