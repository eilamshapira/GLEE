"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's agree on this fair split: I take $600000 and you get $400000. It’s efficient and avoids any delays (and potential inflation issues). I think both of us benefit from closing the deal now. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Alice, considering the inflation, I think a split of $550,000 for me and $450,000 for you is fair. This way, we both get a good deal before the money loses more value.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about inflation further cutting into your share. In this round, I'll propose a division where you receive $875000 (which at today's terms is effectively $700000 given the 20% devaluation in this round) and I take $125000. If we delay further, your portion will shrink even more in real value. I believe this deal is mutually optimal given the circumstances. Let’s settle now rather than face further losses. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 875000 
# Alice gain: 125000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
