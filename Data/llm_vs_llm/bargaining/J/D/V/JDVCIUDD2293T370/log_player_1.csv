"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to propose a split of $10,000 to Bob. My goal is to maximize my gain while also making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept it within the 12 rounds. I'm aware of the time constraint and the impact of inflation on my earnings.

Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **Fairness:** This split gives me a slightly larger portion, but it still provides Bob with a substantial $4,000.
*   **Early Round Advantage:** In the initial rounds, I can afford to be slightly more aggressive, anticipating that Bob might be willing to negotiate further.
*   **Risk Mitigation:** Offering Bob $4,000 reduces the risk of him rejecting the offer outright, which would lead to further rounds and potential value loss due to inflation.
*   **Unknown Inflation:** I don't know Bob's inflation rate. A decent offer at the start might be more appealing than a later offer of a seemingly larger amount that, in reality, holds less value for Bob.

I'm ready for Bob's response."
