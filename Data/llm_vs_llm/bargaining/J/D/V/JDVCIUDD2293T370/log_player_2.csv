"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. Alice is proposing I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000.

If I reject, we move to round 2 where I can make a counter-offer, but the money will be worth 5% less to me. 
$4,000 now vs. $4,000 * 0.95 = $3,800 in the next round.

While this isn't a completely equal split, getting $4,000 now is better than risking further rounds with diminishing value. Plus, there's no guarantee Alice would accept a more favorable offer from me.
