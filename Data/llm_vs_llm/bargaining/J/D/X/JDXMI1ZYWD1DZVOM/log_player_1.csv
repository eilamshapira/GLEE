"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair initial offer, considering that delays will hurt me more than Bob due to the 20% inflation penalty per round.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose a slightly higher share for myself (55%) since Bob knows I face inflation pressure and might use it against me in later rounds. This is still a reasonable split that gives Bob a significant portion (45%) and should be acceptable to avoid further rounds where my share would be worth less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
* If I accept now, I get $4000, but with 20% inflation, it's really worth $3200 to me
* If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, I'll face 40% inflation on whatever I get
* Even if I managed to get a better split next round, the additional inflation would likely make it worth less than $3200 to me
* Bob knows I'm under inflation pressure and is leveraging it

While this isn't the fairest split, given the inflation penalty I face, accepting this offer is likely better than continuing to negotiate.
