"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer gives me $4,500 while she takes $5,500 out of the total $10,000. 

Let me think about this strategically. With each passing round, the money loses 20% of its value for Alice, but keeps the same value for me. This gives me an advantage in later rounds.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, Alice would be facing a 20% devaluation of whatever amount she gets. The total $10,000 would only be worth $8,000 to her in the next round. This weakens her negotiating position.

I could likely propose a much more favorable split for myself in the next round, and Alice would have incentive to accept rather than face further devaluation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice faces a 20% devaluation for each round that passes, the $10,000 is now only worth $8,000 to her in this round. This gives me significant leverage.

I'll offer a division that accounts for this devaluation while still giving Alice enough incentive to accept rather than risk another round of devaluation.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

I propose this split because $4,000 for Alice now is worth more to her than potentially getting a slightly larger amount in the next round when it would be devalued by another 20%. This offer is fair considering the time-value difference between us."
