550000.0,450000.0,Let's split it fairly! I propose $550000 for me and $450000 for you. This is a generous offer considering future inflation.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
344800.0,655200.0,"Alice, I’m proposing a division that accounts for the upcoming inflation. If you accept now in Round 2, you’ll receive $344800 (which is worth more to you now than waiting, given the 10% loss per round), while I secure $655200. This split reflects our respective discount rates and ensures a better payoff for you now rather than risking further devaluation. What do you say?",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, my offer is $600000 for me and $400000 for you. Inflation is hurting us both. This split acknowledges the time value of money, and gives you a fair portion considering the circumstances.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
310340.0,689660.0,"Alice, considering our respective discount factors (5% for me and 10% for you per round) the calculations show that if you reject this offer you could secure a nominal $344830 as proposer in Round 5, which—when discounted—yields the same value as what I’m offering you now. Therefore, I propose that I receive $689660 and you receive $310340. Accepting now spares us both further losses to inflation. I believe this is a fair, calculated split that reflects our future prospects. What do you say?",Bob,4,

650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, let's stop the losses. I propose $650000 for me, and $350000 for you. This reflects a final offer that accounts for all the rounds of inflation.",Alice,5,
