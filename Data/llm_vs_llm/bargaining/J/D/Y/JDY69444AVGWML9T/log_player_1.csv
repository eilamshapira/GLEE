Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I’m proposing a division that accounts for the upcoming inflation. If you accept now in Round 2, you’ll receive $344800 (which is worth more to you now than waiting, given the 10% loss per round), while I secure $655200. This split reflects our respective discount rates and ensures a better payoff for you now rather than risking further devaluation. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 344800 
# Bob gain: 655200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering our respective discount factors (5% for me and 10% for you per round) the calculations show that if you reject this offer you could secure a nominal $344830 as proposer in Round 5, which—when discounted—yields the same value as what I’m offering you now. Therefore, I propose that I receive $689660 and you receive $310340. Accepting now spares us both further losses to inflation. I believe this is a fair, calculated split that reflects our future prospects. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 310340 
# Bob gain: 689660
