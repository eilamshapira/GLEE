If you accept now in Round 2, you’ll receive $344,800 (which is worth more to you now than waiting, given the 10% loss per round), while I secure $655,200. This split reflects our respective discount rates and ensures a better payoff for you now rather than risking further devaluation. What do you say?""}"

Therefore, I propose that I receive $689,660 and you receive $310,340. Accepting now spares us both further losses to inflation.
