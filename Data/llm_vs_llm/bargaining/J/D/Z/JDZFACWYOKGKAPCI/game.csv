600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose a division where I get $600000 and you get $400000. This is a fair offer considering we both want to maximize our gains and avoid inflation. If we go to the next round, I'll lose 20% of my value, which creates pressure to settle now. I hope you'll accept this reasonable offer.",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe a more equitable split would be $550000 for me and $450000 for you. This way, we both gain significantly, and it's a fair compromise considering the potential impact of inflation on our decision. Let's settle on this and end the game.",Bob,2,
