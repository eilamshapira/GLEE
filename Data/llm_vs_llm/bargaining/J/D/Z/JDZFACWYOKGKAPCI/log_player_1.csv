"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a division where I get $600,000 and you get $400,000. This is a fair offer considering we both want to maximize our gains and avoid inflation. If we go to the next round, I'll lose 20% of my value, which creates pressure to settle now. I hope you'll accept this reasonable offer.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe a more equitable split would be $550000 for me and $450000 for you. This way, we both gain significantly, and it's a fair compromise considering the potential impact of inflation on our decision. Let's settle on this and end the game. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
