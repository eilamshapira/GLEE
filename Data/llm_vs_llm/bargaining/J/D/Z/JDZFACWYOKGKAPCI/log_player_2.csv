"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a division where I get $600000 and you get $400000. This is a fair offer considering we both want to maximize our gains and avoid inflation. If we go to the next round, I'll lose 20% of my value, which creates pressure to settle now. I hope you'll accept this reasonable offer. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe a more equitable split would be $550,000 for me and $450,000 for you. This way, we both gain significantly, and it's a fair compromise considering the potential impact of inflation on our decision. Let's settle on this and end the game.""
