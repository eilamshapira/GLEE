900000.0,100000.0,I think a fair split would be 90% for me and 10% for you. What do you say?,Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, I'm rejecting your 90-10 split as it's too one-sided. Since the money loses 10% value for you each round but not for me, it's in your interest to agree sooner. I'm offering you 400k, which is fair considering the inflation factor. If you reject and we go to round 3, your 900k would only be worth 810k to you, and you'd likely get even less in my next offer.",Bob,2,
