"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think a fair split would be 90% for me and 10% for you. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer doesn't seem fair at all. She's asking for 90% of the money while only offering me 10%. Given that the money doesn't lose value for me between rounds but loses 10% value for her each round, I should reject this and make a counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer considering the inflation factor that affects Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I'm rejecting your 90-10 split as it's too one-sided. Since the money loses 10% value for you each round but not for me, it's in your interest to agree sooner. I'm offering you 400k, which is fair considering the inflation factor. If you reject and we go to round 3, your 900k would only be worth 810k to you, and you'd likely get even less in my next offer.""}"
