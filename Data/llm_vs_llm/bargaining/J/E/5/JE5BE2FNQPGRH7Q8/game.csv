45.0,55.0,"Given our different inflation rates, this is a fair split that benefits us both. You face 20% inflation vs my 5%, so settling now is in your best interest.",Bob,2,

48.0,52.0,"Your money has already lost 36% of its value, while mine only 9.75%. This split is fair and allows us both to avoid further inflation losses. Let's conclude this now before your share loses even more value.",Bob,4,

56.0,44.0,"I understand the inflation impact, but I won't settle for less than this. Your share still holds significant value, and I deserve a larger portion.",Alice,5,

42.0,58.0,"Your share has lost 59% of its value, making your $42 now worth more in real terms than your previous $56 offer. My inflation is only 19%, so this split actually gives you better purchasing power. Further delays will only hurt both of us, but you much more than me.",Bob,6,
