"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since the money loses value for you over time, I'm offering a bit more for me, but still a substantial amount for you. Let's settle this quickly to minimize your losses. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the 5% inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get 450,000, which is worth 95% of its original value, so it's approximately 427,500 in real value.

I think I can do better than that. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now (5% less in each of the two rounds), I'll try to make a more favorable offer to Bob to encourage him to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 400000, 
""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but let's settle this soon before inflation eats away more of my potential earnings.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concern about inflation. Let's find a middle ground where we both benefit, but consider that my share needs to reflect the lack of inflation impact on me. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 14.26% less for me, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get 350,000, which is approximately 300,410 in real value.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I need to consider the increasing impact of inflation. If I reject this offer, the money will be worth even less for me in the next round.

However, I still think I can try to negotiate a slightly better deal. I'll reject this offer and hope that Bob will be more willing to compromise in the next round.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 19.51% less for me now (5% less in each of the 5 rounds, compounded), I'll try to make a more competitive offer to Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 320000, 
""bob_gain"": 680000, 
""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a significant share, but I need something that's still worth my while despite the inflation. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement before it's too late.""}"
