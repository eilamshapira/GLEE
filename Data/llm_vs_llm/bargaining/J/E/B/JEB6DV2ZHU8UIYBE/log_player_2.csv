"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I propose that I take $6500 and you take $3500. Given your higher inflation rate, I think this is fair. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $3500 for me, $6500 for Alice
2. If I reject, next round:
   - My offer will be worth 20% less to me
   - Her money will be worth 5% less to her
   - I can make a counter-offer
3. The high inflation rate on my side (20%) means waiting is costly for me
4. 65/35 split is not very favorable to me

However, given the high inflation rate affecting me, if I reject, my bargaining power in the next round will be significantly weakened. Even if I make a better offer, the 20% depreciation means I'd need to get significantly more just to break even.

For example, to get the same value in the next round, I'd need: $3500 / 0.8 = $4375 just to match the current offer's value to me.
