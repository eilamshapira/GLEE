"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to make an offer that Bob is likely to accept, considering the declining value of the money for both of us. I'll start with a relatively generous offer to increase the chances of acceptance in this first round.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the current value of the money for me. Accepting Bob's offer would give me $50, which is worth 5% less than in round 1. So, it's like receiving $50 * 0.95 = $47.50 in round 1 money.

My initial offer was to get $60, which would have been ideal, but Bob rejected it. Now, I need to decide if $47.50 is a good enough deal, considering the risk of further inflation in the next round if I reject it.

I'll accept this offer.

""decision"": ""accept""
