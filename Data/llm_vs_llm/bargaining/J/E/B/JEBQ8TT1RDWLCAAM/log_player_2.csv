"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's offer carefully, considering both my immediate payoff and the possibility of making a counter-offer.

Alice has offered me $40 out of the $100, taking $60 for herself. While this isn't an even split, it's not an unreasonable offer either. I should also consider that there's no inflation penalty for me (0% less value per round), so I don't lose anything by continuing to the next round.

However, I don't know how inflation affects Alice. If she faces inflation, she might be more willing to accept a more favorable offer from me in the next round. On the other hand, if she doesn't face inflation either, we could potentially go back and forth for multiple rounds.

I think I can propose a more equitable split in the next round, so I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a more balanced split that's slightly in my favor but still fair enough that Alice might accept it.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'm offering a 55-45 split in my favor. This is more balanced than Alice's initial 60-40 split in her favor, and gives her a reasonable portion while improving my position. Since there's no inflation for me, I'm comfortable negotiating, and this offer strikes a good balance between being fair enough that Alice might accept it while still improving my position from her initial offer."
