"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I want a bit more to compensate for the inflation next round. Let's settle this quickly! 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll calculate the actual value I'd get:

$4800 / 1.05 (5% less due to inflation) = approximately $4571.43

Since Bob's offer gives me a significant amount, and I don't know how the inflation affects him, I'll accept this offer to avoid further losses.
