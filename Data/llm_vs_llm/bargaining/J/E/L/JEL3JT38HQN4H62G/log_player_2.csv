"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

If I reject, the money will be worth 5% less next round, but I'll get to make the counter-proposal. The current offer gives me $40.

If I wait until next round, the maximum I could get would be discounted by 5%, so even if I proposed keeping most of the money, I'd be getting less than $95.

$40 right now is not a terrible offer, considering Alice made the first move and there's inflation risk. While I could try negotiating for more, there's a risk of losing value through inflation or failed negotiations.
