"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I suggest a fair split where I get slightly more as the first mover. This way we can both walk away with a substantial amount without risking value loss from inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness in the first round. This time, I propose a slightly more equitable split, reflecting the risk of inflation.  Let's both secure a comfortable amount. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. If I accept now:
   * I get $450,000, but it's worth 20% less due to inflation
   * My real value = $450,000 * 0.8 = $360,000

2. If I reject and make a new offer:
   * Next round my money will be worth another 20% less (64% of original value)
   * Need to consider if I can get a better deal despite further devaluation

3. Bob's offer is reasonable considering:
   * The inflation penalty I'm facing
   * The risk of further value loss if negotiations continue
   * It's still a substantial amount
