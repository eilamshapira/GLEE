"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be fair and split the money with a slight advantage for me as I initiated the first offer. This way, we both walk away with a substantial amount. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's offering me $400,000 while taking $600,000 for herself. 

If I reject this offer, I can make my own proposal in the next round. However, due to the 20% inflation effect, the money will be worth less to me in the next round. This means my $1,000,000 to divide would effectively be worth $800,000 to me.

If I accept now, I get $400,000 with no inflation. If I reject and we go to another round, even if I proposed a more favorable split for myself, the total value would be reduced for me.

Given the inflation penalty and the fact that $400,000 is a substantial amount, I'll accept this offer.
