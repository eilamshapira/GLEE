"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is proposing that I get $4,500 while she gets $5,500. I need to consider if I should accept or reject.

If I reject, I'll make a counter-offer in the next round, but due to 10% inflation, the total value would be worth only $9,000 to me. If I were to get the entire amount in the next round (which is unlikely), it would be worth $9,000 to me.

$4,500 now is better than potentially getting less value in future rounds due to inflation. While I could try to negotiate for a more equal split, the 10% inflation penalty makes immediate resolution attractive.
