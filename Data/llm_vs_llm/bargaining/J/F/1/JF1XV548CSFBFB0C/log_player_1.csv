"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I need to make an offer to Bob, keeping in mind the inflation that affects me. I'll try to be reasonable but also prioritize getting a good portion of the money before it loses too much value.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the inflation. My 6000 from the previous round is now worth 6000 * 0.8 = 4800. Bob is offering 4500. It's less, but it's also earlier in the game, meaning further rejections will cost me more. Let's accept.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
