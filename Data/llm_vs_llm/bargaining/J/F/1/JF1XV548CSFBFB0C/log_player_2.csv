"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $4,000 while she takes $6,000 out of the $10,000 total. If I reject, we move to Round 2 where inflation reduces the value of my potential share by 20%, but I would get to make the next offer.

If I reject, the total value for me in Round 2 would effectively be $8,000 (due to 20% inflation from my perspective). Even if I proposed a very favorable split for myself in the next round, Alice might reject, leading to further rounds and more inflation.

Since this is the first round and $4,000 is a substantial portion, it might be better to secure this amount now rather than risk further devaluation.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair offer while considering the inflation factor.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering a split where I receive $5,500 and Alice receives $4,500. This is a fair offer that recognizes we both need to come to an agreement soon to avoid losing value to inflation. From my perspective, the total pot is already worth less than the original $10,000 due to 20% inflation after the first round, so reaching an agreement now benefits both of us."
