"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my offer for the first round. Given that we're facing different inflation rates (20% for me, 5% for Bob), I need to consider this carefully.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering you $450,000, Bob, which is a substantial portion. I believe this is fair given our inflation asymmetry - if we delay, the total value decreases more significantly for me than for you. This gives us both a strong incentive to agree now rather than face diminishing returns in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 440000 
# Bob gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer. While I'm getting a bit less than I proposed originally, the 20% inflation rate for me means that delaying further would significantly reduce the value of my gain. $440,000 now is better than potentially getting a larger nominal amount that's worth less in real terms in future rounds."
