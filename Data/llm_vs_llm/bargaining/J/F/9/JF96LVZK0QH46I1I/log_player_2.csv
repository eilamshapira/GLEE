"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze the offer.

*   **Bob's gain:** $450,000 initially.
*   **Alice's gain:** $550,000 initially.

Since this is round 1, the money is not yet devalued. If I accept, I get $450,000. If I reject, the money's value will decrease in the next round by 5% for me and 20% for Alice. I believe I can get a better deal in the next round, considering the large difference between our devaluation rates.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, it's my turn to make an offer. I need to consider that if Alice rejects, her potential gain will decrease by 20%, while mine decreases by 5%. This gives me some leverage. I also want to maximize my potential gain while making it attractive enough for Alice to accept. I'll aim for slightly more than half, factoring in the potential devaluation for her in the next round.
