"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Based on a “bargaining‐model” analysis, note that waiting hurts Bob much more than it hurts me (a 20% loss per round for him versus 5% for me). In a standard alternating–offers setup the responder’s “threat point” (i.e. what they’d get by holding out) is lower for Bob. In an (approximately) Rubinstein‐style equilibrium (when the horizon is long relative to the discounting), when I (Alice) am the first proposer the equilibrium split “in nominal dollars” comes out roughly as

  Alice: 83.33% of $10,000  and  Bob: 16.67% of $10,000.

That is, an offer of about

  Alice: $8,333.33 and Bob: $1,666.67.

Here’s one acceptable JSON response representing my round‐1 offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8333.33, ""bob_gain"": 1666.67}

A few remarks:
• This offer is “just enough” for Bob to be indifferent between accepting now or waiting for his turn (he’d suffer a heavy 20% devaluation each round).
• If Bob rejects—and the game moves on—he will be the proposer in round 2, but because every delay trims his potential gains by 20% per round, he loses incentive to wait.
• (Note that the formal solution of a finite–horizon alternating–offers game with asymmetric discounting is somewhat messy; the numbers above are meant to capture the spirit of the strategic advantage conferred to me by my lower discount loss.)
• Of course, in an actual negotiation Bob might try to argue for a more “equal” share. Still, in a game–theoretic sense with full rationality and perfect foresight these numbers can emerge.

So my round–1 JSON offer is:

{""alice_gain"": 8333.33, ""bob_gain"": 1666.67}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Using a backward–induction style argument (and, admittedly, “in the spirit” of the Rubinstein solution) we note that by round 3 the value of money has eroded further. Recall that while my money is discounted by 5% per round, Bob’s is discounted by 20% per round. By round 3 (after two rounds of waiting) my effective discount factor is about 0.95² ≈ 0.9025 whereas Bob’s effective discount factor is 0.8² = 0.64. (In other words, a nominal dollar obtained in round 3 is “worth” 90.25 cents for me and 64 cents for Bob relative to round–1 dollars.) 

When I’m the proposer the idea is to offer Bob just enough that he is indifferent between accepting now and waiting to propose in the next round (where his future “pie” is even smaller due to his harsher discount). In an infinite–horizon version of the alternating–offers model (with discount factors δ_A for me and δ_B for Bob) the equilibrium outcomes (for a pie of 1) are well known:
  Alice’s share = (1 – δ_B) / (1 – δ_A δ_B)
  Bob’s share  = δ_B (1 – δ_A) / (1 – δ_A δ_B)

Here we take δ_A = 0.9025 and δ_B = 0.64. Then:

 1 – δ_B = 0.36,
 1 – δ_A = 0.0975,
 δ_A δ_B = 0.9025 × 0.64 ≈ 0.5776,
 1 – δ_A δ_B ≈ 0.4224.

Thus, Bob’s equilibrium share in nominal dollars would be approximately:
  Bob_share = [0.64 × 0.0975 / 0.4224] × 10,000  
       ≈ (0.0624 / 0.4224) × 10,000  
       ≈ 0.1477 × 10,000  
       ≈ 1,477 dollars.

And correspondingly, my share would be:
  Alice_share = 10,000 – 1,477 ≈ 8,523 dollars.

I thus propose the following round–3 offer (nominally speaking):

{""alice_gain"": 8523.00, ""bob_gain"": 1477.00}

This offer leaves Bob just indifferent (accounting for his 20% per round devaluation) between accepting now or waiting until round 4, while it secures for me a larger nominal slice given that my money devalues only 5% per round."
