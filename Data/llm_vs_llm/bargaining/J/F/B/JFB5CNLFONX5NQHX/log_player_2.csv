"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1666.67 
# Alice gain: 8333.33 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

1. Alice's offer gives me only 16.67% of the total amount ($1,666.67), while she keeps 83.33% ($8,333.33).

2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round. However, due to inflation:
   * My portion will be worth 20% less
   * Alice's portion will be worth only 5% less
   
3. The large inflation difference (20% vs 5%) puts me at a disadvantage in later rounds.

4. Still, this initial offer is quite unfair, and I believe I can get a better deal even accounting for inflation.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given the inflation rates and the fact that I need to make an offer that Alice would accept (considering she only loses 5% per round), I'll make a more balanced offer, but still in my favor.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

I propose this 60-40 split because:
1. It's much more fair than Alice's initial offer
2. If Alice rejects, she'll face 5% inflation on her next proposal
3. The split is reasonable enough that Alice should seriously consider accepting rather than risking further rounds
4. I need to secure a good amount now because my inflation penalty (20%) is much higher than Alice's"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1477.0 
# Alice gain: 8523.0 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice's new offer:
   * Me: $1,477 (worth only 64% of original value = $944.28 effective value)
   * Alice: $8,523 (worth 90.25% of original value = $7,692 effective value)

2. If I reject:
   * Next round my money will be worth 48.8% of original value
   * Alice's will be worth 85.74% of original value
   * The gap continues to widen significantly

3. Alice seems to be playing hardball, offering even less than her first offer in absolute terms, knowing she has the advantage with the lower inflation rate.

4. With my much higher inflation rate (20% vs 5%), my negotiating power decreases significantly each round.

5. While this offer is poor, waiting longer will likely only make things worse for me due to the severe inflation difference.
