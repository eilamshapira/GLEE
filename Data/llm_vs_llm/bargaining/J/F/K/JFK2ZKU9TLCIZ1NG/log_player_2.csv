"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair division. I believe this split benefits both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer of $400,000 for me and $600,000 for her, or reject it and make a counter-offer.

While Alice's offer gives me a substantial amount, it's not an equal split of the $1,000,000. Since this is just the first round and we have 11 more potential rounds, I'll reject this offer and propose a more balanced division in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think a 50-50 split is the fairest approach. We each get exactly half of the money, which is completely equal and gives us both a great outcome.""}"
