Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the rapid decrease in value for me, I propose a 60-40 split. This offer considers the inflation impact more fairly for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000

Round 3

{
""alice_gain"": 6500,
""bob_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. This offer still considers the inflation impact but ensures a fairer outcome for me. It's our last chance for a decent agreement.""

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, with each round, the value of the money drops significantly for me. This 70-30 split reflects the urgent need to settle before the value diminishes further. It's our last chance to reach an agreement that considers the severe impact of inflation on my side. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough decision, but waiting any longer is too risky. Bob is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation rate and unlikely to offer anything better. Accepting a 30/70 split is far from ideal, but it's better than walking away with nothing after another rejection."
