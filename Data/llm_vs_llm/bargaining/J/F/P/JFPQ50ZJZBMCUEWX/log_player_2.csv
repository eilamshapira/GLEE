Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the inflation rates and the decreasing value of the money, it might be wise to consider accepting this offer. However, let's calculate the actual values after inflation:

For Bob:
- Original value: $450,000
- Inflation: 36%
- Actual value: $450,000 * (1 - 0.36) = $288,000

For Alice:
- Original value: $550,000
- Inflation: 9.75%
- Actual value: $550,000 * (1 - 0.0975) = $495,625

Considering the actual values, it might be better to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds.
