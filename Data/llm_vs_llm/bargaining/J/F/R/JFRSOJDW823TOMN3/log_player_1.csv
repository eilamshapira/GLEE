"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split that accounts for the different inflation rates we face. Since my money loses value faster (20% vs 10% per round), I should ask for a bit more to make it equitable.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This slightly higher amount for me helps offset my higher inflation rate, while still being a reasonable offer that Bob should find acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. Due to inflation:
- If I accept now, my $40 is worth $40 * 0.8 = $32 in round 1 value
- Bob's $60 is worth $60 * 0.9 = $54 in round 1 value

This offer is quite unfavorable to me. If I reject, I can make another offer next round, though the money will be worth even less then. However, I still think I can get a better deal by negotiating further, especially since Bob's inflation rate is also significant.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since we're now in round 3, let me calculate the effective values:
- Money I receive will be worth 60% of original value (20% less twice)
- Money Bob receives will be worth 81% of original value (10% less twice)

Given these diminishing values, I need to increase my nominal amount to achieve a fair split in real terms.

{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}

I propose this split because my $65 is effectively worth only $39 in round 1 value (65 * 0.6), while Bob's $35 is worth $28.35 in round 1 value (35 * 0.81). This accounts for our different inflation rates while still giving both of us significant value. We should try to reach an agreement soon before inflation erodes too much value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
- My $35 at 51.2% value (100% - 48.8%) = $17.92 in round 1 value
- Bob's $65 at 72.9% value (100% - 27.1%) = $47.39 in round 1 value

This offer is even worse than the previous one for me. The inflation is seriously eating into our potential gains, but this split is too unfavorable. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal, even considering the continuing inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","We're now in round 5, and the inflation is becoming quite serious:
- My money is worth 40.96% of original value (80% five times)
- Bob's money is worth 59.049% of original value (90% five times)

Given the rapidly diminishing value and the fact that we've already spent 4 rounds negotiating, I'll make a more compromising offer to try to reach an agreement.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

This offer means:
- My $60 is effectively worth $24.58 in round 1 value (60 * 0.4096)
- Bob's $40 is effectively worth $23.62 in round 1 value (40 * 0.59049)

This is a more balanced offer in real terms, and we really need to reach an agreement soon before inflation destroys too much value. I hope Bob will see this as a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
- My $30 at 32.77% value (100% - 67.23%) = $9.83 in round 1 value
- Bob's $70 at 59.05% value (100% - 40.95%) = $41.34 in round 1 value

The situation is getting critical:
1. We've used half of our rounds (6 of 12)
2. The value is rapidly diminishing for both of us
3. This offer gives me less than $10 in effective value

However, this offer is very unfavorable, and I still have negotiating power. Even with the severe inflation, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","We're now in round 7, and the situation is getting critical:
- My money is worth 26.214% of original value (80% seven times)
- Bob's money is worth 47.829% of original value (90% seven times)

Given that we only have 5 rounds left and the severe value erosion, I need to make a more conciliatory offer that has a high chance of being accepted.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

This means:
- My $55 is worth $14.42 in round 1 value (55 * 0.26214)
- Bob's $45 is worth $21.52 in round 1 value (45 * 0.47829)

While this gives Bob a better deal in real terms, it's much more balanced than his previous offer. We really need to reach an agreement soon, as we risk getting nothing if we don't agree within 5 rounds. I hope Bob recognizes this as a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
- My $25 at 20.97% value (100% - 79.03%) = $5.24 in round 1 value
- Bob's $75 at 47.83% value (100% - 52.17%) = $35.87 in round 1 value

The situation is now very serious:
1. Only 4 rounds remaining
2. Values have eroded dramatically
3. This offer gives me only about $5 in effective value

However, this offer is extremely unfavorable to me, giving Bob nearly 7 times more value than me in real terms. Even with the severe time pressure and inflation, I think I can still negotiate a better deal. If Bob continues to be this aggressive, we risk both getting nothing.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","We're in a critical situation:
- My money is worth 16.777% of original value (80% nine times)
- Bob's money is worth 38.742% of original value (90% nine times)
- Only 3 rounds left after this one

Given the urgency and severe value erosion, I need to make a very pragmatic offer that has a high chance of being accepted.

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}

This means:
- My $45 is worth $7.55 in round 1 value (45 * 0.16777)
- Bob's $55 is worth $21.31 in round 1 value (55 * 0.38742)

While this gives Bob significantly more in real terms, it's much more balanced than his previous offers. With only 3 rounds left and rapidly diminishing value, we absolutely must reach an agreement soon. This is a serious compromise from my side to avoid both of us getting nothing. I hope Bob recognizes this as a reasonable offer given our time pressure."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this critical situation:
- My $20 at 13.42% value (100% - 86.58%) = $2.68 in round 1 value
- Bob's $80 at 38.74% value (100% - 61.26%) = $30.99 in round 1 value

We are now in an extremely dangerous position:
1. Only 2 rounds remaining after this
2. Values have eroded catastrophically
3. If we don't agree within 2 more rounds, we both get zero

Even though this offer gives me very little value, the risk of getting nothing is becoming very real. If I reject, we'll only have two more chances to agree, with even worse inflation. Given this game theory situation, I should accept this low offer rather than risk getting nothing.
