"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 2, taking into account the inflation:

The money is now worth 10% less for me, so the effective value for Bob is 90$.
The money is now worth 20% less for Alice, so the effective value for Alice is 80$.

My offer:
```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""alice_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 4:

The money is now worth even less for both of us. Let's calculate the effective values:

*   **My value (Bob):** The money is 10% less valuable each round. So, in round 4, it's 100 \* (0.9)^3 = 72.9$ effectively.
*   **Alice's value:** The money is 20% less valuable each round. So, in round 4, it's 100 \* (0.8)^3 = 51.2$ effectively.

I'll try to be a bit more aggressive now.

```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 65,
  ""alice_gain"": 35
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","Alright, here's my offer for Round 6. Inflation continues to eat away at the value. Let's recalculate:

*   **Bob's Value:** The money is now worth 100 \* (0.9)^5 = 59.05$ effectively.
*   **Alice's Value:** The money is now worth 100 \* (0.8)^5 = 32.77$ effectively.

Given the diminishing value, I'll push for a larger share, but still leave Alice something.

```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""alice_gain"": 30
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, let's crunch the numbers again for Round 8:

*   **Bob's Value:** 100 \* (0.9)^7 = 47.83$ effectively.
*   **Alice's Value:** 100 \* (0.8)^7 = 20.97$ effectively.

The money is getting quite devalued for both of us.  I'll try to secure a more substantial amount for myself, but I don't want to be greedy and risk getting nothing.

```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 75,
  ""alice_gain"": 25
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 83.22% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $100.","Alright, this is getting down to the wire. Let's see...

*   **Bob's Value:** 100 \* (0.9)^9 = 38.74$ effectively.
*   **Alice's Value:** 100 \* (0.8)^9 = 13.42$ effectively.

We're close to the end, and the money is significantly devalued. I'll have to offer a lot to myself to take the risk.

```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 80,
  ""alice_gain"": 20
}
