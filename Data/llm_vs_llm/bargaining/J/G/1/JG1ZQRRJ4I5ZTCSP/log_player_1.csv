"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. I need to factor in the inflation for myself. Here's my first offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

My reasoning: I'm starting with a proposal that favors me, but is still reasonable enough that Bob might accept. I am taking the inflation into account."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob rejected my offer and is now offering me $40. However, due to inflation, that $40 is worth 20% less to me. So, it's effectively worth $40 * 0.8 = $32.

Since this is only round 2, I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, it's my turn again. Inflation is hitting me hard now. My money is now worth only 64% of what it was initially (80% of 80%).

I'll try to balance getting a decent amount with making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35
}
```
I increased my share because of the continued inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob is offering a 50/50 split. However, my $50 is now only worth $50 * (1 - 0.488) = $50 * 0.512 = $25.6.

While this isn't ideal, it's getting late in the game, and the inflation is really hurting me. I think this is the best I'm going to get. I'll accept.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
