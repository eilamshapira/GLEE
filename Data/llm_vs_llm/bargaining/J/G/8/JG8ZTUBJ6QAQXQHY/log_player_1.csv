"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to avoid the 10% inflation penalty that will affect me in the next round.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 51-49 split in my favor. This takes into account the 5% inflation penalty I've already incurred. It's still a fair deal for you, considering that future inflation rates for me are unknown to you. 
# Alice gain: 490000 
# Bob gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. If I accept Bob's offer:
   * I get $490,000, but it's worth 10% less = $441,000 effective value
   * Inflation will continue to reduce value in future rounds

2. If I reject:
   * Next round, I can make a new offer
   * But any amount I get will be worth 20% less than original value
   * Bob seems willing to make reasonable offers

Given that Bob's offer is fairly balanced, and waiting another round would cost me significantly more in inflation (an additional 10%), I should accept this offer. The effective value I'm getting ($441,000) is better than what I'm likely to get after more rounds of inflation.
