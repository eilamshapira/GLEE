"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make my first offer to divide $100 between Bob and me.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I receive $55 and Bob receives $45. This is a fair offer considering that Bob faces greater time pressure due to the 5% inflation per round for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 53, ""bob_gain"": 47}

I propose I receive $53 and Bob receives $47. This is a reasonable split that acknowledges both of our positions while moving toward a middle ground. The longer we negotiate, the more Bob loses due to his 5% inflation rate per round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 51, ""bob_gain"": 49}

I propose I receive $51 and Bob receives $49. I'm moving closer to an even split to reach an agreement. Given that we're now in round 5 and Bob's value decreases with each round due to his 5% inflation rate, this is a fair offer that benefits both of us."
