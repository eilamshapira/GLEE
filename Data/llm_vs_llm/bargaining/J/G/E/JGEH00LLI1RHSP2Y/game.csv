6000.0,4000.0,Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you get 40%. What do you say?,Alice,1,

4800.0,5200.0,"I propose a more balanced split that's close to 50-50. This is fairer than your initial offer, and we should reach an agreement soon to avoid losing value to inflation.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but 4800 for me is too low.  Let's split it 55/45. We're both losing money with each round, so let's settle this before things get worse.",Alice,3,
