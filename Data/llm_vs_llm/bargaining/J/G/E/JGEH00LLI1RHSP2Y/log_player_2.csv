"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you get 40%. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me 4000$ (40% of 10,000$)
2. If I reject, we go to next round where I can make an offer
3. However, due to 5% inflation, my money will be worth less in the next round
4. 4000$ now is better than 4200$ in the next round (which would be worth 3990$ after 5% inflation)
5. However, this first offer seems a bit unfair - Alice is asking for a larger share without justification

I think I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer, even accounting for inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split, considering that we both need to come to an agreement and time pressure affects me:

{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""I propose a more balanced split that's close to 50-50. This is fairer than your initial offer, and we should reach an agreement soon to avoid losing value to inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 4800 for me is too low.  Let's split it 55/45. We're both losing money with each round, so let's settle this before things get worse. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is now offering me 4500$ (45%)
2. Due to 9.75% inflation for me, this 4500$ is actually worth 4061.25$
3. I now know that Alice is affected by even higher inflation (36%), which explains why she's more eager to compromise
4. If I reject, and we continue for another round:
   - My inflation penalty increases
   - Alice's inflation penalty increases even more
   - This gives me some negotiating power, but also risks both of us losing more value

Given that:
- The offer is more balanced than the initial 60/40 split
- Alice is under more inflation pressure than me
- The real value I'm getting (4061.25$) is still decent
- Further delays will reduce value for both of us
