"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both lose value in later rounds, and you lose less than I do per round.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, since you lose 20% per round compared to my 10%, waiting longer hurts you more than me. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor, which is actually better for you than waiting another round where your money would be worth even less. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $45, but it's worth 20% less than round 1, so effectively $36
- If I reject and propose in next round, any amount I get will be worth another 20% less
- Bob's logic about the time pressure affecting me more is correct
- A counter-offer next round would need to be significantly better to overcome the 20% loss

Given that Bob has accurately identified his stronger negotiating position due to the asymmetric inflation rates, and considering that waiting another round will significantly decrease my effective gains, I should accept this offer.
