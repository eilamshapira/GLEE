"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both lose value in later rounds, and you lose less than I do per round. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me $40 while taking $60. She's right that I lose less value per round (10% vs her 20%), but that actually gives me more leverage to negotiate a better deal.

If I reject and propose next round:
- My $40 would become worth $36 (10% less)
- Her $60 would become worth $48 (20% less)

Since she loses value faster than me, I should be able to negotiate a more favorable split by rejecting this offer and making a counter-proposal next round.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split, using the fact that Alice loses more value per round as leverage.

{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Alice, since you lose 20% per round compared to my 10%, waiting longer hurts you more than me. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor, which is actually better for you than waiting another round where your money would be worth even less.""}"
