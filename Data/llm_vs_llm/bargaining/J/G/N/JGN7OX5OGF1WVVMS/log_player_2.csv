"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering a 50-50 split, which means $500,000 for each of us. This is a fair offer on the surface, but I need to consider the inflation effect. If I reject, in the next round the $1,000,000 will only be worth $800,000 to me due to 20% inflation. My counter-offer would be made on this reduced amount.

Since $500,000 now is better than potentially getting a larger percentage of a smaller pie later (and risking further rounds of inflation), I'll accept this offer.
