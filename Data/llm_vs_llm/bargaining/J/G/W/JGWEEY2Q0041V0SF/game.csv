0.0,10000.0,"Hi Bob, to avoid any future complications (and since my share loses 20% of its value every round), I propose that you receive the entire $10000 today. This way you secure your full payoff immediately, and we avoid the risk of reaching later rounds. I look forward to your acceptance!",Alice,1,

3000.0,7000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your generous offer, but I think a more balanced approach would be better. I'm proposing I get $7000 and you get $3000. This is fair considering your 20% depreciation per round - if you reject, your next round's $3000 would only be worth $2400 to you. Let's reach an agreement now rather than letting your value decrease further.",Bob,2,
