"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 0, ""bob_gain"": 10000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, to avoid any future complications (and since my share loses 20% of its value every round), I propose that you receive the entire $10,000 today. This way you secure your full payoff immediately, and we avoid the risk of reaching later rounds. I look forward to your acceptance!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your generous offer, but I think a more balanced approach would be better. I'm proposing I get $7000 and you get $3000. This is fair considering your 20% depreciation per round - if you reject, your next round's $3000 would only be worth $2400 to you. Let's reach an agreement now rather than letting your value decrease further. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
