"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to avoid any future complications (and since my share loses 20% of its value every round), I propose that you receive the entire $10000 today. This way you secure your full payoff immediately, and we avoid the risk of reaching later rounds. I look forward to your acceptance! 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","While this offer would give me the entire sum, which is advantageous for me, I should consider whether this is the most strategic approach given the game's structure.

Alice is correct that her money loses 20% value each round, but mine doesn't depreciate at all (0% inflation for me). This gives me a significant advantage in later rounds.

Since I would be making the offer in round 2 if I reject, and there are 12 rounds total, I could potentially propose a more balanced split that still favors me but isn't completely one-sided.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a split that acknowledges the inflation factor for Alice while still using my advantageous position.

{""bob_gain"": 7000, 
""alice_gain"": 3000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your generous offer, but I think a more balanced approach would be better. I'm proposing I get $7000 and you get $3000. This is fair considering your 20% depreciation per round - if you reject, your next round's $3000 would only be worth $2400 to you. Let's reach an agreement now rather than letting your value decrease further.""}"
