Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my previous offer was generous considering the inflation. Now, I'm increasing my demand. This is the final offer, and I won't negotiate further. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is even worse than Bob's first offer, considering the inflation for both of us. It's becoming clear that Bob is trying to exploit the inflation situation to his advantage.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept such an unfair deal."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 3800 
# Bob gain: 6200

This is incredibly frustrating, but I need to be realistic.  Bob's offer is terrible, but if I reject it, I risk losing even more in the following rounds due to inflation, and we might end up with nothing.  This is the best I can get from him, so I accept."
