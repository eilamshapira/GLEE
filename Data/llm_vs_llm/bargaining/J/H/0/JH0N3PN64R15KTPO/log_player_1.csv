"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer to Bob in this first round.

Given that there's a 20% inflation penalty for each passing round for me, it's in my interest to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. However, I also want to propose a fair division that Bob would be likely to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I believe this is a reasonable first offer that gives me a slight advantage while still offering Bob a substantial portion. If Bob rejects this and we move to the next round, the $100 would be worth only $80 to me due to inflation, which means I should consider accepting a lower portion in later rounds."
