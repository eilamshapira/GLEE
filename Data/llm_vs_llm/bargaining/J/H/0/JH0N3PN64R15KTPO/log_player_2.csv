"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Alice's offer where I would get $45 and she would get $55. Let me evaluate this proposal carefully.

The offer is fairly close to an even split, with Alice taking slightly more than half. While I'd ideally prefer a 50-50 split, this is a reasonable initial offer. If I reject and move to the next round, I'd get to make a counter-proposal, but there's no guarantee Alice would accept a better offer from me.

Given that there's no inflation penalty for me (0% inflation effect), there's no cost to rejecting and continuing to the next round. However, I don't know Alice's inflation rate, which might influence her decisions.

Since the offer is reasonably fair and close to 50-50, and considering the uncertainty about future rounds, I'll accept this offer.
