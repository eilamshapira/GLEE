"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a very fair offer. Let's get this done! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is highly unfavorable, giving me only 10% of the total amount. Even with the 5% inflation risk for the next round, it's worth rejecting this very uneven split and making a counter-proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. This way we both win equally and can conclude the deal before inflation reduces the value further.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's try this.  Inflation is eating away at our gains. This is a slightly better split for me to account for the previous round, but still very close to 50/50. Let's accept this and be done. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a reasonable offer to accept. While slightly favoring Alice, the 47.5%-52.5% split is close enough to fair, and with inflation already reducing my gains by 9.75%, rejecting this offer would likely lead to worse outcomes. The risk of further inflation and potentially worse offers makes this a good time to conclude the negotiation."
