"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer is extremely uneven, giving me only 1% of the total amount while Alice gets 99%. Given that the value decreases by 5% for me each round while remaining the same for Alice, I should make a counter-offer rather than accept this unfair division.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more equitable offer considering the 5% inflation penalty I face per round.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split, which is fair to both of us. Since I face a 5% penalty per round and you don't, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. This even division respects both our interests equally."
