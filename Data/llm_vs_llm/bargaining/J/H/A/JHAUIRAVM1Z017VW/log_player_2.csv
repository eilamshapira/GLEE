"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this carefully. Alice is offering a 50-50 split of the $100, which would give me $50.

If I reject and move to the next round, I need to consider that the money will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation. This means in the next round, the $100 would only be worth $95 to me. However, I would get to make the proposal in the next round.

Since the current offer is fair (50-50) and rejection would mean I'm working with less effective value in the next round, I should accept this offer.
