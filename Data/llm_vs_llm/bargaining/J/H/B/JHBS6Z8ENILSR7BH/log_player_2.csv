"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5.15 
# Alice gain: 94.85 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is extremely unfair, even considering the inflation. I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}
``` 

I'm increasing my demand slightly from Round 2, as the inflation is starting to hurt more. This offer still gives Alice a reasonable share, but importantly secures a larger portion for me before the value depreciates further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 31 
# Alice gain: 69 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The effects of inflation are becoming severe. While not ideal, accepting this offer guarantees me a larger sum than if I continue to reject and the value decreases further."
