"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a reasonable but slightly advantageous offer for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose this split because while I want a fair outcome, I also want to maintain a strong negotiating position. This offer gives Bob a substantial portion while leaving room for negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a perfectly fair 50-50 split, which is the most equitable solution. While I initially tried for a better deal for myself, there's no reason to reject a completely fair division, especially since prolonging negotiations could risk both of us getting nothing.
