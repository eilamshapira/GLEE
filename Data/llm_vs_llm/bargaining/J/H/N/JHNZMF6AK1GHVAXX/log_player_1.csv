"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a reasonably fair offer, but keeping a slight advantage for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split because it's close to equal while giving me a small advantage as the first mover. It's fair enough that Bob should seriously consider accepting it rather than moving to the next round."
