"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze Alice's offer:
- Alice proposes I get $4,500 and she gets $5,500
- This gives me 45% of the total amount
- We have 12 rounds total, so I have opportunity to counter-offer
- If we reach round 12 without agreement, we both get nothing

While I could counter with a more equal split, Alice's offer is fairly reasonable. I'm getting a substantial portion, and negotiating further risks potential breakdown of negotiations.
