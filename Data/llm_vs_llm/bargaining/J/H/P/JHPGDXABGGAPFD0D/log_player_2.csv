"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value will be worth 5% less to me (but not to Alice). 
So $100 will become worth $95 from my perspective.

Alice's current offer is a 50-50 split, which would give me $50.
If I reject, I'd need to get more than $52.63 in the next round to make up for the 5% loss ($52.63 * 0.95 = $50).

Since this is a fair initial offer and it would be hard to get significantly more in the next round (given Alice knows I'm facing inflation), I should accept.
