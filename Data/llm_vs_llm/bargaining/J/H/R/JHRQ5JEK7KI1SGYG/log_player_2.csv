"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000 (40%)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to inflation:
   - The money will be worth 5% less to me next round
   - The money will be worth 20% less to Alice next round
4. This means in the next round:
   - $10,000 will be worth $9,500 to me
   - $10,000 will be worth only $8,000 to Alice

Given that Alice will suffer much more from inflation (20% vs my 5%), I have leverage to get a better deal by rejecting this offer. I can propose a more favorable split next round, and Alice will be more likely to accept due to her higher inflation penalty.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that Alice faces a much higher inflation rate (20% vs my 5%), I'm in a stronger negotiating position. However, I shouldn't be too aggressive as Alice might still reject and make the total pie smaller for both of us.

A fair but strategic offer would be to propose a 60-40 split in my favor, considering:
1. Alice already loses 20% value if she rejects
2. My offer should still be reasonable enough to accept
3. We both benefit from concluding the deal now rather than letting inflation erode the value

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

I propose this 60-40 split because it gives me a better position than Alice's initial offer while still being reasonable enough that Alice should accept given her high inflation penalty for refusing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Current offer: $4,500 for me, $5,500 for Alice
2. Due to inflation:
   * My $4,500 is actually worth $4,061.25 (9.75% less)
   * Alice's $5,500 is actually worth $3,520 (36% less)
3. If I reject:
   * Next round will have additional 5% inflation for me (total 14.75%)
   * Additional 20% inflation for Alice (total 56%)
   * The total money will be worth even less for both of us

This is actually a better offer than Alice's first offer ($4,000), and considering:
1. The significant inflation impact we've already experienced
2. The risk of further value loss in next rounds
3. Alice has moved significantly from her initial position
4. The offer is reasonably fair given the circumstances
