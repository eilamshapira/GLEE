"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more since I'm losing out to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $4,000 and she gets $6,000, arguing that she should get more since I'm affected by inflation but she isn't.

Let me evaluate this. With 20% inflation per round for me, if I reject and propose in round 2, the money would be worth 20% less to me. That means waiting one round reduces the effective value of the entire $10,000 to $8,000 for me.

If I accept now, I get $4,000. If I reject, I could propose a better split next round, but I'd need to get significantly more than $5,000 to offset the inflation loss, which might lead Alice to reject.

Given the inflation penalty and the risk of prolonged negotiation reducing the value further, this isn't an unreasonable first offer.
