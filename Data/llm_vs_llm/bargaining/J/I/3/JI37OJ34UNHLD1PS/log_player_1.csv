"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a reasonable first offer that takes into account the differential inflation rates affecting Alice and me.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm offering you $55 while giving Bob $45. This is a fair starting offer considering that inflation affects Bob more severely than me, which means he has more incentive to reach an agreement sooner."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll adjust my offer considering the inflation effects and our negotiation so far.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing an even 50-50 split. This is fair and reasonable, especially considering that Bob is facing a much higher inflation rate (20% per round) compared to my inflation rate (5% per round). It's in both our interests to reach an agreement sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a more accommodating offer considering the increasing inflation impact.

{""alice_gain"": 48, ""bob_gain"": 52}

I'm offering you $48 and Bob $52. With Bob's much higher inflation rate (20% per round compared to my 5%), this deal becomes increasingly favorable for him the longer we wait. We're now in round 5, so Bob's money has already lost nearly half its value, while mine has only lost about 19%. A prompt agreement benefits us both."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 43 
# Bob gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to be more strategic given the increasing impact of inflation on both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 46, ""bob_gain"": 54}

I'm offering you $46 and Bob $54. At this point, we're in round 7, and Bob's inflation has reduced his money's value by over 73%, while mine has lost about 26%. This deal is quite favorable for Bob considering our different inflation rates. Further delays will significantly hurt both of us, but especially Bob due to his higher inflation rate."
