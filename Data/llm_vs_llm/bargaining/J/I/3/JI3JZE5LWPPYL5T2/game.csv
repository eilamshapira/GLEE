6429.0,3571.0,"Alice, here's my proposal for round 2: I take $3571 and you get $6429. Given that every round imposes a cost – my share loses 20% per round and yours 10% – this split reflects the fact that your patience gives you a stronger fallback if we delay further. I believe this is the fair equilibrium division for both of us at this stage. Let's finalize the deal now to avoid additional losses.",Bob,2,
