Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, here's my proposal for round 2: I take $3571 and you get $6429. Given that every round imposes a cost – my share loses 20% per round and yours 10% – this split reflects the fact that your patience gives you a stronger fallback if we delay further. I believe this is the fair equilibrium division for both of us at this stage. Let's finalize the deal now to avoid additional losses. 
# Alice gain: 6429 
# Bob gain: 3571 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
