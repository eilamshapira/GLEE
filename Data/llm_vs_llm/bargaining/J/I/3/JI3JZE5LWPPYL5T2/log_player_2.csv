"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you 1000$. Take it or leave it. This is the first round, and you'll get less if you refuse. Let's get this done! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 3571, ""alice_gain"": 6429, ""message"": ""Alice, here's my proposal for round 2: I take $3,571 and you get $6,429. Given that every round imposes a cost – my share loses 20% per round and yours 10% – this split reflects the fact that your patience gives you a stronger fallback if we delay further. I believe this is the fair equilibrium division for both of us at this stage. Let's finalize the deal now to avoid additional losses.""}"
