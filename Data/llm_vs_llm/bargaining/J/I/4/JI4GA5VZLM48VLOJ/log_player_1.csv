"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll play this game as Alice. I want to be fair but also ensure I get a reasonable share.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose a 50-50 split, which is the fairest division of the money. This equal division respects both of our interests and follows principles of fairness."
