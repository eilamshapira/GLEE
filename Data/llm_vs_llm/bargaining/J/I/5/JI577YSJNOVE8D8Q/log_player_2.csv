"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me 4000$ out of 10,000$
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, my money will be worth less next round
4. 4000$ now is better than 4200$ next round (which would be worth 3990$ to me after inflation)
5. There's also risk Alice might offer less in future rounds

While 40% isn't the most generous split, it's a reasonable first offer and the inflation penalty makes waiting costly.
