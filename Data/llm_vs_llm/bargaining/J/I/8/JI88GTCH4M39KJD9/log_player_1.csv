"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair offer to Bob in the first round.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose an equal split of $500,000 each. This is a fair division that gives us both the same amount, and by accepting now, we avoid the 10% inflation loss that would occur if we go to another round."
