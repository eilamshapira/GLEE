"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I made the first move. This is still a fair offer giving you a substantial portion.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. Delaying further means both of us will lose value due to inflation. I believe this offer is fair and avoids additional loss of value for us both. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer because:
1. The 55-45 split is relatively fair
2. Further delays would reduce the value due to inflation
3. The difference from my initial proposal is not large enough to justify continuing negotiation and losing more value"
