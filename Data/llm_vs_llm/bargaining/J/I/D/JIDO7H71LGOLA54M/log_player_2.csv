"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. While Alice is offering me 4000$ out of the 10,000$, I should keep in mind that if I reject and we move to the next round, the money will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation. If I reject, I'd need to make a better offer in the next round that Alice would accept.

Let me calculate: If I reject, the total pot is still worth 10,000$ nominally, but it's worth only 9,000$ to me due to the 10% inflation. This means even if I managed to get the entire amount in the next round (which is unlikely since Alice would probably reject), I'd only get 9,000$ in effective value.

Since 4,000$ now is greater than 0$ and potentially better than what I might get after factoring in further rounds of inflation, I should consider accepting.
