60.0,40.0,Hi Bob! Let's split the money with me getting 60% and you getting 40%. It's a good deal to start off with strong rounds before inflation kicks in.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Alice, let's be fair. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This is a reasonable adjustment from your initial offer, and a much better starting point for us to work from considering the increasing effect of inflation on my gains with each passing round.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
50.0,50.0,"Hi Bob, let's split it evenly. Given inflation, I think a 50/50 split is the fairest approach for both of us right now. Let's settle the deal this time!",Alice,3,
