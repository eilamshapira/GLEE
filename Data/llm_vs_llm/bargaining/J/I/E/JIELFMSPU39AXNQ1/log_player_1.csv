Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob! Let's split the money with me getting 60% and you getting 40%. It's a good deal to start off with strong rounds before inflation kicks in.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be fair. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This is a reasonable adjustment from your initial offer, and a much better starting point for us to work from considering the increasing effect of inflation on my gains with each passing round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
