"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Let's split the money with me getting 60% and you getting 40%. It's a good deal to start off with strong rounds before inflation kicks in.

# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Alice, let's be fair. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This is a reasonable adjustment from your initial offer, and a much better starting point for us to work from considering the increasing effect of inflation on my gains with each passing round.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split it evenly. Given inflation, I think a 50/50 split is the fairest approach for both of us right now. Let's settle the deal this time! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
