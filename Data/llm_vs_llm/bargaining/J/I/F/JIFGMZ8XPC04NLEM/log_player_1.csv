"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split that accounts for potential future inflation if Bob declines.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split to give myself a slight advantage while still being fair enough that Bob might accept. If he declines, my next opportunity to receive money would be worth 10% less to me, so I need to account for that risk in my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Due to inflation, $500,000 is now worth $450,000 to me (90% of original value)
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, any amount I get will be worth only 80% of the original value
3. Bob's offer is actually quite fair in absolute terms (50-50 split)
4. Given the inflation penalty I'm facing, if I reject, I would need to secure a significantly higher amount in the next round to make up for the additional 10% loss
