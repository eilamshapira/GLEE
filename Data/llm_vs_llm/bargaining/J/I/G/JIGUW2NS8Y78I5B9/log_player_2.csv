"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. It's a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
2. However, if I reject, I can make my own offer next round
3. The downside is that inflation will reduce the value by 5% next round
4. If I reject, the $5000 would be worth $4750 next round due to inflation
5. Any negotiation for a better deal might result in less value due to inflation

Given these factors, a 50-50 split in the first round is actually quite reasonable. If I try to negotiate for more, I might end up with less real value due to inflation.
