"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically. Alice has proposed a perfectly equal 50-50 split, which is fair. While I could reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the 20% inflation penalty means we'd only be splitting $80 instead of $100, making us both worse off. Getting $50 now is better than getting less in future rounds due to inflation.
