"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's start with a fair split favoring me slightly due to inflation pressure. This is Round 1, let's get this done quickly! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $450,000 out of $1,000,000
2. If I reject, we move to Round 2 where I can make an offer
3. However, due to 20% inflation, my money will be worth 20% less in the next round
4. $450,000 in this round is better than $500,000 in the next round (which would be worth $400,000 to me due to inflation)
5. The split is reasonably fair (45-55)

Given these factors, especially considering the inflation penalty I face, this is actually a good offer. If I reject, I'll lose value due to inflation, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal.
