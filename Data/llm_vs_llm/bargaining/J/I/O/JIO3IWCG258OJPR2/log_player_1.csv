"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to consider the decreasing value of the money for me over time while Bob's valuation remains constant. I want to propose a fair division that Bob will likely accept, especially in the first round.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   I'm offering Bob $4000, which is a significant amount and might incentivize him to accept early.
*   I'm keeping $6000, which gives me a good starting point, considering the inflation factor. I believe it's a good balance between getting a reasonable share now and avoiding further devaluation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this. Bob is offering me $4000. Since it's round 2, my money is worth 20% less. This means $4000 in this round is equivalent to $4000 * 0.8 = $3200 in round 1 terms.

Given the risk of further devaluation in subsequent rounds, and the fact that I would have preferred $6000 in the previous round to the $4000 he offered me now (knowing it is worth $3200), I will reject.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's my turn to make an offer again. I need to factor in that my money is now worth 40% less (20% less for each of the previous two rounds). I also need to consider that Bob rejected my initial offer of $6000, which means he likely values a higher share.

To try and secure a deal, I'll adjust my offer, trying to find a balance between what I perceive as fair and what Bob is likely to accept. I will offer him a bit more while still securing a decent amount for myself, considering the inflation.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   I'm increasing Bob's share to $4500. This might be enough to entice him, especially considering he previously asked for $6000.
*   I'm reducing my share to $5500. However, with the 40% devaluation, that is 5500 * 0.6 = $3300 in round 1 terms.

I hope he accepts this offer."
