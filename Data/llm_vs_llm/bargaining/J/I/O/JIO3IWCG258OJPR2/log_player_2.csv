"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me 4000$ out of 10,000$, which is 40% of the total. If I reject:
1. I can make a counter-offer in the next round
2. Alice's value of money will decrease by 20% in the next round
3. My value remains the same

Since Alice's money will be worth 20% less to her next round, I can likely negotiate a better deal. The 6000$ she wants will only be worth 4800$ to her next round, which gives me more leverage.

Therefore, I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice's money is now worth 20% less to her, I can propose a more favorable split for me while still being attractive to her. The 6000$ she wanted in round 1 is now only worth 4800$ to her.

I'll propose a 6000/4000 split in my favor, which is essentially reversing her original offer. For her, the 4000$ is actually worth only 3200$ now, but if she rejects and we go another round, her share will be worth even less to her.

{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000}

I propose this 6000/4000 split to reach a fair agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice is now offering me 4500$ (up from 4000$ in round 1)
2. Her 5500$ share is worth only 3520$ to her (5500$ * 0.64) due to the 36% inflation on her side
3. If I reject:
   - We go to round 4
   - Alice's inflation will increase to 48%
   - I can make another counter-offer
   - But we also risk running out of rounds

While I could potentially get a better deal by rejecting, Alice has shown she's willing to negotiate by increasing my share. Also, as rounds progress, we risk reaching the 12-round limit with no deal. Since this is a reasonable improvement from the first offer, I'll accept.
