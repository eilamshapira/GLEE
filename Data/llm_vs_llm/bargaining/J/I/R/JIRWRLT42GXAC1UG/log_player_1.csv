"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's split the money fairly. I'm proposing 60/40. This is a good starting point, and we can both walk away with a substantial amount. Let me know what you think.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be more reasonable, 55/45 is a better split considering the game's dynamics. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
