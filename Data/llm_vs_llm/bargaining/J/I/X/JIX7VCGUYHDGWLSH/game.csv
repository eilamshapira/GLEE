16.82,83.18,"Hi Bob. Considering that if you reject this offer you’ll be the proposer next round—but with the 5% discount—you’d roughly secure $87.56 next round, which in today’s money works out to about $83.18 for you. I’m offering you that amount now so that we both avoid further devaluation. I believe this is fair given our respective discount rates. What do you say?",Alice,1,
