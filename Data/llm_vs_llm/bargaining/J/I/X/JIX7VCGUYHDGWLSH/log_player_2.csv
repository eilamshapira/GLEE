"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob. Considering that if you reject this offer you’ll be the proposer next round—but with the 5% discount—you’d roughly secure $87.56 next round, which in today’s money works out to about $83.18 for you. I’m offering you that amount now so that we both avoid further devaluation. I believe this is fair given our respective discount rates. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 83.18 
# Alice gain: 16.82 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Current offer: $83.18 for me, $16.82 for Alice

2. If I reject:
- Next round I can propose
- Money will be worth 5% less to me
- Money will be worth 20% less to Alice
- I could potentially get more, but the total value will decrease

3. Alice's reasoning is sound:
- She's offering me what I could reasonably expect to get next round
- We both benefit from avoiding devaluation
- The split accounts for our different discount rates

4. This is actually a very fair offer considering:
- I get the majority of the money
- It saves us from value loss
- It's close to what I could optimize for in the next round

Given this analysis, it would be rational to accept. The offer is fair and trying to get more might lead to worse outcomes for both of us due to the devaluation.
