"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, hoping he'll find that acceptable. I'm keeping $60 for myself, which seems like a reasonable starting point considering the time constraint and potential for the money to lose value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this.

Bob is offering me $40, and keeping $60 for himself. Due to inflation, my $40 would only be worth $40 * 0.95 = $38 of the original value. Bob's $60 is worth $60 * 0.90 = $54 of the original value.

I think I will reject and make my own offer in the next round.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, let's try this. Remember the money loses value.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35
}
```

I'm increasing my share to $65 to compensate for potential future losses, but I'm still offering Bob a significant $35, which is hopefully enough for him to accept, considering the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's calculate the value.

Bob is offering $45, which is now worth $45 * (1-0.1426) = $38.66 in original value for me. His $55 is worth $55 * (1-0.271) = $40.10 in original value for him.

This is getting tight. I'm not happy with $38.66. I'm going to try one more time to get a better offer.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, this is getting serious. I need to consider the diminishing returns.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 70,
""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

I'm asking for $70. Hopefully, Bob accepts this. If he rejects again, the potential losses from further inflation become a significant factor. $30 is still something, and it's better than nothing for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this carefully.

Bob is offering $50. After inflation, my $50 would be worth $50 * (1 - 0.2262) = $38.69 in original money. Bob's $50 would be worth $50 * (1 - 0.4095) = $29.53 in original money.

This is getting very close to the wire. While $38.69 isn't great, the alternative is potentially getting nothing. I'm going to accept.

```json

""decision"": ""accept""
}
