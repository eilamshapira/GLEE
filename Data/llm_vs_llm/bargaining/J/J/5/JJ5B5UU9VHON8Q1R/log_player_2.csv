"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $450,000 (45%) and keeping $550,000 (55%)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to inflation:
   - For me, money will be worth 10% less next round
   - For Alice, money will be worth 5% less next round
4. If I reject, my $450,000 would be worth $405,000 in purchasing power next round
5. This is a fairly reasonable first offer, close to 50-50

Given that inflation will hurt me more than Alice (10% vs 5%), and the offer is reasonably fair, I should accept now rather than risk losing value through negotiation.
