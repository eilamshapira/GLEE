"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it equally. This way, both of us get a fair share before inflation reduces the value of the money. It's a win-win situation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The reasoning behind accepting: While this offer gives me slightly less than what I proposed, it's still a fair 50-50 split. If I reject, we'll move to round 3 where the money will be worth another 20% less due to inflation. Taking $500,000 now (worth 80% of the original value = $400,000 in round 1 terms) is better than risking further depreciation of the total amount in subsequent rounds. It's a reasonable compromise that benefits both parties."
