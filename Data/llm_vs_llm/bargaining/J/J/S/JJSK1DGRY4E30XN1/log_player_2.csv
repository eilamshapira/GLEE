"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. This is a $200,000 vs $800,000 split, heavily favoring Alice
2. If I reject, due to 10% inflation, the next round's total value to me will be worth 900,000
3. I could make a more favorable counter-offer in the next round
4. We still have 11 rounds left, so there's plenty of room for negotiation
5. The first offer is often a test to see what the other player will accept

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer, but still giving Alice a decent portion to encourage acceptance:

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

My reasoning:
1. This is a much more equitable split than Alice's initial offer
2. I'm offering Alice a substantial amount (450k) which is reasonable
3. If Alice rejects, the next round will be worth 10% less to me
4. By making a fair offer early, we can avoid losing value to inflation
5. This demonstrates I'm willing to be reasonable while also standing up for my interests"
