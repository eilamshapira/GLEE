"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, by rejecting my round 2 offer you'll get to propose in round 3, but the pie will shrink further. To give you the same present value youâ€™d expect from waiting (around $3556 after discount), I offer you $4444 in round 2. This way, we both maximize our outcomes given the discount factor. Please accept. 
# Alice gain: 4444 
# Bob gain: 5556 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
