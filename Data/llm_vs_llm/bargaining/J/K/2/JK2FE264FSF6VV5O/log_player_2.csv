Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5556, ""alice_gain"": 4444, ""message"": ""Alice, by rejecting my round 2 offer you'll get to propose in round 3, but the pie will shrink further. To give you the same present value youâ€™d expect from waiting (around $3,556 after discount), I offer you $4,444 in round 2. This way, we both maximize our outcomes given the discount factor. Please accept.""}"
