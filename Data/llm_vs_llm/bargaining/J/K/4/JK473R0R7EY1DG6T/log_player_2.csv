"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer as it's too uneven. Since there's no inflation penalty for me and we have multiple rounds, I can make a counter-offer that's more balanced."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I propose a fair and equal split of the money. This is the most equitable solution that benefits both parties equally."
