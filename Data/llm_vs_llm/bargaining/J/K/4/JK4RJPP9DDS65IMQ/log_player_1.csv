"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a slightly favorable split for myself while still being fair enough that Bob might accept to avoid inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this split because:
1. If Bob rejects, the next round will have 20% inflation for me
2. It gives Bob a substantial amount while still maintaining an advantage for me
3. It's a clean 60-40 split that's easy to understand"
