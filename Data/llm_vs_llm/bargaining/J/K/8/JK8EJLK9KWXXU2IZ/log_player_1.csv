"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split with a slight advantage for me since I'm making the first offer. I want to secure a good deal before inflation affects the value.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. If I accept Bob's offer now, I'll get $45 but it's worth 10% less due to inflation, so effectively I'm getting $40.50 in round 1 value. If I reject and make another offer in the next round, any amount I receive will be worth even less (20% less than round 1). Since $40.50 is still a substantial amount and better than risking further depreciation, I should accept this offer.
