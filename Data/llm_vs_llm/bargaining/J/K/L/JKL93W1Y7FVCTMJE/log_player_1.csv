"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I am trying to find a balance between maximizing my potential gain and securing a deal before inflation eats away at the value of the money.  Bob's offer was too low, but I also need to be mindful that he may not accept an offer much lower than this in future rounds."
