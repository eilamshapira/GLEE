"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Since Alice's money loses 10% value each round, if I reject and make a counter-offer, her $70 would only be worth $63 to her in the next round. This gives me negotiating leverage.

I can likely get a better deal by rejecting this initial offer, as $30 is quite low given that I don't face any value depreciation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice faces 10% depreciation per round, I should offer her enough to make accepting more attractive than waiting another round.

If Alice rejects my offer, in the next round (round 3) any money she gets would be worth 90% * 90% = 81% of the original value to her. This means I can offer her slightly more than what she'd get in the next round to make accepting attractive now.

I'll propose a more balanced split, but one that still advantages me:

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

The reasoning I'll explain to Alice is: ""Given that waiting another round would make your share worth 10% less, this is a fair offer that gives you more value now than waiting."""
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice is offering me $45, which is better than her initial offer of $30
2. She's taking $55, but due to 19% inflation, it's only worth about $44.55 to her
3. If I reject:
   - We go to round 4
   - Any money Alice gets will be worth 27.1% less (another 10% drop)
   - I could offer something else, but Alice might reject again
   - The back-and-forth is starting to make the deal less valuable for Alice

This is actually a fairly reasonable offer now. I get $45 (full value), and Alice gets $55 (but worth $44.55 to her), making it almost an equal split in terms of real value.
