"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer to Bob. Given the 5% inflation per round, I want to make a fair offer that's reasonable for both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split which is fair for both of us. Since inflation affects me by 5% each round, it's in my interest to reach an agreement quickly, and I believe an equal division is the most likely to be accepted."
