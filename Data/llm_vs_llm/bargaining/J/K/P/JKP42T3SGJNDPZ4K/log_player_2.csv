"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $40 while she gets $60.

While this isn't a 50-50 split, it's not terribly unfair. I need to consider that:
1. I have the opportunity to counter-offer if I reject
2. The money doesn't lose value for me over rounds
3. We have 11 more rounds if I reject
4. However, if we can't agree within 12 rounds, we both get nothing

Given these factors, I think I can try to negotiate for a better deal. Since there's no inflation penalty for me, I can afford to reject this and make a counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a more balanced split, but still giving Alice a decent portion to increase chances of acceptance.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I propose this split as it's closer to an equal division while still being reasonable. Since Alice opened with a 40-60 split in her favor, offering a 55-45 split in my favor is a measured counter-proposal that isn't too aggressive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has increased her offer to me from $40 to $45 compared to round 1
2. I now know that Alice is experiencing inflation (19% less value for her)
3. My value remains unchanged
4. Her current proposal is closer to a 50-50 split than her first offer
5. If I reject, we still have 9 rounds left, but Alice's inflation will continue to increase

Given that:
- Alice is now offering a more reasonable split
- She's facing significant inflation (her $55 is worth less now)
- She moved significantly from her initial position
- It's a fairly balanced offer

I'll accept this offer as it's reasonable and continuing to negotiate might make Alice's position worse due to inflation without necessarily improving my outcome.
