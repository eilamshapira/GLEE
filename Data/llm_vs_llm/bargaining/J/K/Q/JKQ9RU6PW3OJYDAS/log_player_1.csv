"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering I'm making the first move and taking initiative in these negotiations.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn now, a 55-45 split is more reasonable, considering we both have equal claim to the money. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
- If I accept now, I get $4500, but due to 10% inflation, it's actually worth $4050 to me
- If I reject and we go to next round, any amount I get will be worth 20% less
- Bob is offering me 45% of the total, which isn't terrible
- Continuing negotiations with increasing inflation risk could leave me worse off
