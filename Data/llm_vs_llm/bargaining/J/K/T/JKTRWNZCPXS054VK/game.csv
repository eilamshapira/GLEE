99.0,1.0,"Hi Bob, here's my offer: I get $99 and you get $1. I know it might not seem much for you—but if you reject, you'll be the proposer next round, and because your money will be devalued by 20%, you’d be forced to give almost everything to me to get your proposal accepted. In effect, waiting would leave you with nothing better. So it’s in your best interest to accept this offer now!",Alice,1,

1.0,99.0,"Alice, I understand your previous strategy, but now the tables have turned. I'm offering you $1 because, just as you pointed out last round, you can't afford to reject this offer. If you do, the game will continue, and you'll risk getting nothing. So, it's in your best interest to accept this offer now.",Bob,2,

99.99,0.01,"Hi Bob, here's my proposal for Round 3. If you reject this offer, you'll become the proposer in Round 4. But because of inflation, by Round 4 your money will be worth only 40% of its face value—and as we can anticipate by backward induction, I'll be able to extract almost everything in the following round. In effect, your continuation value after rejecting is virtually nothing. Thus, even the tiny $0.01 offered here (which, after the 40% multiplier, has some small positive value) is strictly better than what you'd get if we proceed further. Please accept this deal.",Alice,3,

0.01,99.99,"Alice, I see what you're trying to do, but I won't fall for it. Now, I'm offering you $0.01. If you reject this offer, you'll get nothing in the next round. It's in your best interest to accept this offer now, as it's better than nothing.",Bob,4,
