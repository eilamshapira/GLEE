"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly and get this done. I propose 60/40. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's offer carefully.

Alice is proposing a 60/40 split in her favor, where I would receive $4,000 and she would get $6,000.

While this isn't an even split, I need to consider that inflation will reduce the total amount by 20% if I reject and we move to the next round. If I reject, the total will be worth only $8,000 in the next round.

Even with a 50/50 split in the next round, I would get $4,000, which is the same as what I'm being offered now. Plus, Alice might not accept my counter-offer, leading to further rounds and more value loss.
