"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I want to make a fair offer that respects both of our interests while acknowledging the inflation penalty for extending negotiations.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an even 50-50 split of the $10,000. This is fair to both of us and allows us to avoid the 20% inflation penalty that would reduce the total value if we move to another round."
