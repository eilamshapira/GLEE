"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make my first offer to divide $100 with Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I suggest we split the money 60/40. I get $60, and you get $40. This gives you a substantial share while acknowledging that with inflation affecting me each round, I need to secure a reasonable amount now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer considering the inflation information I just learned.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose a 55/45 split. I get $55, and you get $45. This is a more balanced division considering that inflation is affecting both of us - me at 5% per round and you at 20% per round. This offer gives you more than my initial proposal while still being fair to me."
