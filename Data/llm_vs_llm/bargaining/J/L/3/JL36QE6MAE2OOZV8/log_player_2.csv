"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 40$ in the first round, it's not a terrible offer, but I can probably do better. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round. Even with 20% inflation, I could propose a higher amount for myself.

In round 2, the total value for me would be 80$ (due to 20% inflation), but I could propose a more favorable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since this is my turn to propose, I'll make a strategic offer. The money is now worth 80$ to me due to inflation, so I need to make this count.

I'll propose a split that gives me a bit more than Alice's initial offer, but not so much that she's likely to reject it.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

This gives me more than Alice's initial offer, while still leaving Alice with a reasonable amount. Even though it's worth only 44$ to me after inflation (55 * 0.8), it's better than the 40$ I was offered in round 1."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. If I accept Alice's offer of 45$:
   * With 36% inflation, I would actually get 45 * 0.64 = 28.8$

2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
   * Inflation will increase to 56% (20% more than current 36%)
   * Even with a better split, the value will decrease significantly
   * The negotiation is getting riskier as rounds pass

Alice's offer of 45$ (worth 28.8$ to me) is actually worse than her initial offer of 40$ from round 1 (which would have been worth 40$). However, given the accelerating inflation on my side, continuing to negotiate might lead to even worse outcomes.
