"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a slightly favorable split for myself while keeping it reasonable enough for Bob to accept, considering the 5% inflation penalty per round if he refuses.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose $5,500 for me and $4,500 for Bob. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and delaying would cost me value due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. If I accept Bob's offer now, I get $5000 but it's worth 5% less due to inflation, so effectively $4750
2. If I reject, we go to next round where:
   * I can make a new offer
   * But any amount I get will be worth another 5% less (10% total from original value)
   * There's no guarantee Bob will accept my next offer

Given that Bob's offer is quite fair (50-50 split), and further delays will only decrease the value of my share, I should accept this offer.
