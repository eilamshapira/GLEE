5500.0,4500.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a split where I get $5500 and you get $4500. This is slightly in my favor but fair considering I'm making the first offer. If we don't agree now, I'll lose 5% value in the next round, which would hurt my position.",Alice,1,

4750.0,5250.0,"Hi Alice, since you proposed a split favoring yourself last round, I'm suggesting a split of $5250 for me and $4750 for you. This is fair considering the inflation affecting my share each round. Let's settle this now before the value decreases further.",Bob,2,

5100.0,4900.0,"Bob, I'm meeting you closer to the middle with this offer. I get $5100 and you get $4900. This is more balanced than both our previous offers. Consider that I've already taken a 10% inflation hit, making this a reasonable compromise for me. Let's finish this now before we both lose more value to inflation.",Alice,3,
