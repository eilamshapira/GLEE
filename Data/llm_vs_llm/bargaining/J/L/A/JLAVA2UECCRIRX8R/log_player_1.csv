"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob for the division of $10,000. Since I'm playing as Alice and this is the first round, I'll aim for a fair but slightly advantageous split, considering the 5% inflation penalty if we move to another round.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a split where I get $5,500 and you get $4,500. This is slightly in my favor but fair considering I'm making the first offer. If we don't agree now, I'll lose 5% value in the next round, which would hurt my position.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since you proposed a split favoring yourself last round, I'm suggesting a split of $5250 for me and $4750 for you. This is fair considering the inflation affecting my share each round. Let's settle this now before the value decreases further. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5100, 
""bob_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm meeting you closer to the middle with this offer. I get $5,100 and you get $4,900. This is more balanced than both our previous offers. Consider that I've already taken a 10% inflation hit, making this a reasonable compromise for me. Let's finish this now before we both lose more value to inflation.""}"
