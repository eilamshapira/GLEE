"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a split where I get $5500 and you get $4500. This is slightly in my favor but fair considering I'm making the first offer. If we don't agree now, I'll lose 5% value in the next round, which would hurt my position. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 5250,
  ""alice_gain"": 4750,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, since you proposed a split favoring yourself last round, I'm suggesting a split of $5250 for me and $4750 for you. This is fair considering the inflation affecting my share each round. Let's settle this now before the value decreases further.""
}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm meeting you closer to the middle with this offer. I get $5100 and you get $4900. This is more balanced than both our previous offers. Consider that I've already taken a 10% inflation hit, making this a reasonable compromise for me. Let's finish this now before we both lose more value to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
