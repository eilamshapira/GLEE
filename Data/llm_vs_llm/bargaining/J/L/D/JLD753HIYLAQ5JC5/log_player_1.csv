"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's start with a reasonable offer. I propose we split the money 60/40. This gives us both a good amount, and we can avoid further inflation. Let's make a deal now!""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your opening offer, but I believe a 50-50 split would be more fair. This way we both get an equal share of $5000. Since inflation doesn't affect me, I can be patient, but I'd prefer if we could agree on this balanced split now. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
