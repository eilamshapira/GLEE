"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's start with a reasonable offer. I propose we split the money 60/40. This gives us both a good amount, and we can avoid further inflation. Let's make a deal now! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
1. She's offering me 4000$ (40%) while taking 6000$ (60%)
2. There's no inflation for me, so waiting won't decrease my potential gains
3. I have 11 more rounds to negotiate a better deal
4. Since there's no inflation pressure on my side, I can try to negotiate for a more equal split

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split, while being diplomatic:

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your opening offer, but I believe a 50-50 split would be more fair. This way we both get an equal share of $5,000. Since inflation doesn't affect me, I can be patient, but I'd prefer if we could agree on this balanced split now.""}"
