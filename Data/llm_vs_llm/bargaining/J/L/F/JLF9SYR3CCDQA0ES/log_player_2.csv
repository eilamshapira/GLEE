Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Alright, let's try this again. Since time is ticking and inflation is hitting me harder, I'll propose 55 for me and 45 for you. This is a decent split, and we can move on!

# Alice gain: 55
