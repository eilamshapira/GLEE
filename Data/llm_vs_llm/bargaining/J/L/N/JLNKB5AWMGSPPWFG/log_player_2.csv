"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40. It's a fair start considering the inflation affects me more. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: I get $40, Alice gets $60
2. If I reject and propose next round:
   * The total value decreases (5% for me, 20% for Alice)
   * I could propose a better split for myself
   * But Alice might reject, leading to more rounds and more value loss

Given that:
- Alice's inflation penalty (20%) is much higher than mine (5%)
- The current 60-40 split isn't terrible
- Alice made a reasonable argument about her higher inflation rate
- If we go another round, Alice's portion would be worth significantly less to her, making her more likely to demand a higher nominal amount

I'll accept this offer. While not ideal, it's reasonable, and the risk of value loss through additional rounds makes this a decent deal.
