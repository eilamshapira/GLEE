5500.0,4500.0,"Hi Alice, I think splitting it closer to equal would be fair, especially considering the depreciation I face. How about you get $5500, and I get $4500?",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
8000.0,2000.0,"Bob, due to the 40% total depreciation you're now facing, this $2000 is actually worth only $1200 to you. If you reject, the next round will have even worse depreciation (60%). This is your best option now - I suggest you accept.",Alice,3,

6000.0,4000.0,"Alice, with my current depreciation, $4000 is worth only $2560 to me. Given these circumstances, I feel this is a fair offer. Letâ€™s aim for a compromise where we both benefit.",Bob,4,
