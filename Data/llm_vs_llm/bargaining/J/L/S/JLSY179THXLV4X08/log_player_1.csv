"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose I get $7000 and you get $3000. Remember that the money will be worth 20% less to you next round, so this is a fair offer.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think splitting it closer to equal would be fair, especially considering the depreciation I face. How about you get $5500, and I get $4500? 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Bob's current offer: I get $5500, he gets $4500
2. Due to 20% inflation for Bob, his $4500 is actually worth $3600 to him
3. If I reject and make a new offer next round:
   - Bob will face another 20% depreciation
   - I could potentially get more
   - But Bob might reject again, leading to further rounds and depreciation

Given that Bob's position weakens each round due to inflation, and I could potentially make a better offer next round, I should reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Bob, due to the 40% total depreciation you're now facing, this $2000 is actually worth only $1200 to you. If you reject, the next round will have even worse depreciation (60%). This is your best option now - I suggest you accept.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, with my current depreciation, $4000 is worth only $2560 to me. Given these circumstances, I feel this is a fair offer. Letâ€™s aim for a compromise where we both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Bob's current offer: I get $6000, he gets $4000
2. Due to 48.8% inflation for Bob, his $4000 is actually worth about $2048 to him
3. If I reject and make a new offer next round:
   - Bob will face ~60% depreciation
   - I could potentially get more
   - But we're getting to a point where the repeated rejections might lead to mutual losses

While I could potentially get more in the next round, Bob's offer is reasonable given the circumstances, and continuing the game further risks both of us losing value through continued negotiations.
