60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 60/40 split considering our different inflation rates. Since my money loses value faster (20% vs your 10%), this split helps balance our effective gains. Does this seem fair to you?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, I understand that your money devalues faster, but I'd like to propose a 55/45 split. This way, while acknowledging the inflation difference, I also ensure we're closer to equal shares. How does this sound to you?",Bob,2,

58.0,42.0,"Bob, I appreciate your consideration of the inflation difference. Let me compromise from my initial position - I'm offering a 58/42 split. This better accounts for my faster depreciation rate while also moving closer to your desired distribution. The longer we negotiate, the less both of us get due to inflation, so I hope we can reach an agreement soon.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
48.0,52.0,"Thanks for your patience, Alice. Let's try a 52/48 split. This still takes into account the inflation difference, but also moves us closer to equal terms. I hope this proposal works for both of us before inflation impacts further.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
56.0,44.0,"Bob, I appreciate us moving closer to agreement. I'm offering a 56/44 split now, which is a significant compromise from my original position. Given that we're already in round 5 and my money is devaluing at 20% per round versus your 10%, this split helps balance our effective gains. If we continue much longer, we'll both lose significantly to inflation. Let's try to reach an agreement soon.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
49.0,51.0,"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Let's try a 51/49 split. This is a fair middle ground acknowledging both inflation impacts. We're both losing value every round, so I hope we can settle this now.",Bob,6,
