Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 60/40 split considering our different inflation rates.

# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Let me compromise from my initial position - I'm offering a 58/42 split. This better accounts for my faster depreciation rate while also moving closer to your desired distribution. The longer we negotiate, the less both of us get due to inflation, so I hope we can reach an agreement soon.""}"

I'm offering a 56/44 split now, which is a significant compromise from my original position. Given that we're already in round 5 and my money is devaluing at 20% per round versus your 10%, this split helps balance our effective gains. If we continue much longer, we'll both lose significantly to inflation. Let's try to reach an agreement soon.""}"
