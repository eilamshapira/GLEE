"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 60/40 split considering our different inflation rates. Since my money loses value faster (20% vs your 10%), this split helps balance our effective gains. Does this seem fair to you? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand that your money devalues faster, but I'd like to propose a 55/45 split. This way, while acknowledging the inflation difference, I also ensure we're closer to equal shares. How does this sound to you?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your consideration of the inflation difference. Let me compromise from my initial position - I'm offering a 58/42 split. This better accounts for my faster depreciation rate while also moving closer to your desired distribution. The longer we negotiate, the less both of us get due to inflation, so I hope we can reach an agreement soon. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Thanks for your patience, Alice. Let's try a 52/48 split. This still takes into account the inflation difference, but also moves us closer to equal terms. I hope this proposal works for both of us before inflation impacts further.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate us moving closer to agreement. I'm offering a 56/44 split now, which is a significant compromise from my original position. Given that we're already in round 5 and my money is devaluing at 20% per round versus your 10%, this split helps balance our effective gains. If we continue much longer, we'll both lose significantly to inflation. Let's try to reach an agreement soon. 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56
