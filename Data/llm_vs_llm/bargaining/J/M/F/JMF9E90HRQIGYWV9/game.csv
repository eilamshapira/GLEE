4000.0,6000.0,"I appreciate your fair first offer, Alice. I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Since you mentioned concerns about inflation affecting you, I think this is reasonable - especially because we still have many rounds left and I'm willing to compromise. I believe this is a good balance that gives us both a substantial portion.",Bob,2,

4800.0,5200.0,"Bob, considering the inflation affecting my share and your last proposal, I suggest a 48-52 split in your favor. This way, you get a bit more, but we both still benefit before the value decreases further for me.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
3500.0,6500.0,"Alice, I understand inflation is affecting your share significantly. Given that inflation doesn't affect my portion and we still have several rounds available, I'm proposing a 65-35 split. This gives you $3500 now, which is better than risking further inflation in later rounds. If we continue negotiating, your potential share will keep decreasing in value due to inflation, while mine remains stable. This offer represents a fair balance considering our different inflation situations.",Bob,4,
