Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fair first offer, Alice. I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Since you mentioned concerns about inflation affecting you, I think this is reasonable - especially because we still have many rounds left and I'm willing to compromise. I believe this is a good balance that gives us both a substantial portion. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand inflation is affecting your share significantly. Given that inflation doesn't affect my portion and we still have several rounds available, I'm proposing a 65-35 split. This gives you $3500 now, which is better than risking further inflation in later rounds. If we continue negotiating, your potential share will keep decreasing in value due to inflation, while mine remains stable. This offer represents a fair balance considering our different inflation situations.

# Bob gain: 6500
