"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we both get a good share before inflation affects us too much. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's proposal of an even split of $5,000 each.

Since we have 12 rounds, and my money doesn't lose value (0% inflation for me), I don't have a strong incentive to rush to a decision. I could potentially make a counter-offer that gives me more than half in the next round.

However, an even split is fair, and there's risk in rejecting this reasonable first offer. I don't know how inflation affects Alice, which may impact future negotiations.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your fair first offer, Alice. I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Since you mentioned concerns about inflation affecting you, I think this is reasonable - especially because we still have many rounds left and I'm willing to compromise. I believe this is a good balance that gives us both a substantial portion.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering the inflation affecting my share and your last proposal, I suggest a 48-52 split in your favor. This way, you get a bit more, but we both still benefit before the value decreases further for me. 
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's new proposal carefully.

Alice is now offering me $5,200 (52%) while she takes $4,800 (48%). This is better than the initial even split, but not as good as my previous offer where I would have received $6,000.

I now know that inflation is affecting Alice significantly (36% less value in just two rounds), which explains her urgency to reach an agreement. This gives me some negotiating leverage, as each round makes the money less valuable to her but not to me (0% inflation).

Since we still have 9 more rounds possible and I'm not affected by inflation, I can afford to be a bit more assertive in my counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand inflation is affecting your share significantly. Given that inflation doesn't affect my portion and we still have several rounds available, I'm proposing a 65-35 split. This gives you $3,500 now, which is better than risking further inflation in later rounds. If we continue negotiating, your potential share will keep decreasing in value due to inflation, while mine remains stable. This offer represents a fair balance considering our different inflation situations.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, given the significant impact of inflation on my share and your last proposal, I'm suggesting a 40-60 split in your favor. This offer ensures you get a substantial portion while still providing me with a reasonable amount before my share loses even more value. 
# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's latest proposal.

Alice is now offering me 60% ($6,000), which matches what I initially proposed in round 2. She's clearly feeling the pressure of inflation, which has reduced the value of her share by nearly 60% already.

Given that:
1. I'm not affected by inflation at all
2. We still have 7 more possible rounds
3. Each round makes Alice's position worse due to compounding inflation
4. She's now matching what I asked for earlier

I'm in a strong negotiating position. However, if I push too hard, we risk running through all 12 rounds with no agreement, leaving us both with nothing.

Since Alice has moved significantly in my direction and offered me a solid 60% of the total, I'll accept this offer.
