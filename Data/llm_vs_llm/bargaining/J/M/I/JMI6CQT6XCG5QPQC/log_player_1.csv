"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing, so I need to secure a reasonable amount quickly. 
* **Bob's rejection:** Bob rejecting my previous offer suggests he might be aiming for a larger share than 350,000.  
* **Compromise:** This offer is a compromise, moving closer to a more even split while still trying to secure a slight advantage for myself."
