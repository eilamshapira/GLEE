Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I need to account for the fact that my inflation rate (20%) is higher than yours (10%). This means delays hurt me more than you, so I'm proposing a split that better balances our positions. This split is fair considering our different inflation rates. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
