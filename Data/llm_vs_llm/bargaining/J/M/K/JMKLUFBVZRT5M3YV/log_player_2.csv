"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair split. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000 of the $10,000. This isn't an even split, but I should consider the inflation penalties. My money loses 20% value each round, while Alice's loses 10% each round. If I reject now to make a counter-offer, we'll both lose some value.

While I could potentially get more by making a counter-offer, I need to weigh the risk that we might go through multiple rounds and end up with significantly devalued money. 

Given the asymmetric inflation rates that disadvantage me more than Alice, I'll reject this initial offer to propose a more favorable split for myself in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that reflects the asymmetric inflation penalties we face.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but I need to account for the fact that my inflation rate (20%) is higher than yours (10%). This means delays hurt me more than you, so I'm proposing a split that better balances our positions. This split is fair considering our different inflation rates.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to give up some of my potential gains to reach a fair split. How about this? 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's new offer considering the inflation that's already occurred.

Alice is now offering me $4,800 while she takes $5,200. This is more balanced than her initial 4000/6000 split. However, due to inflation, my $4,800 is now worth only 64% of what it would have been in round 1 (a 36% reduction), which means its effective value to me is about $3,072.

If I reject and we continue to the next round, my inflation penalty will increase further (by another 20%), making any future gains worth even less to me.

Alice has moved significantly toward a more balanced split. Given that the inflation is hurting me more than Alice with each passing round, and she's made a substantial concession from her initial offer, I'll accept this offer.
