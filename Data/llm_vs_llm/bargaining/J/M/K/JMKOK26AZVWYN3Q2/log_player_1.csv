"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a reasonable first offer, considering the inflation risk for future rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose I get $60 and Bob gets $40. This is a fair offer that gives me a slight advantage as the first mover, but still leaves Bob with a substantial amount. Given that inflation will reduce the value by 10% each round for me, it's important to reach an agreement soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I'll get $50 with 10% inflation, so effectively $45
- If I reject, next round I can make a new offer but my gains will be worth another 10% less
- The offer is quite fair in nominal terms (50-50 split)
- Waiting longer will only decrease the value further for both of us
- This is just round 2 of 12 possible rounds, but the inflation effect is significant

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer. While I could try to negotiate for more, the risk of further value erosion due to inflation makes this 50-50 split (even with the 10% reduction) a reasonable outcome."
