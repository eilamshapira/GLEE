Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While the offer is a bit better than her last one, it's still in Alice's favor and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly.  I'm hoping to push for a more equitable split."

Alice's offer:

The value of the money is dropping fast, and this offer is close enough to even. It's better to take a slightly smaller amount now than risk getting even less later."
