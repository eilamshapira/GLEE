"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $50,000 while she gets $950,000, which is only 5% of the total for me. That seems quite unbalanced.

Since there's an inflation penalty for Alice (5% less value each round) but not for me (0% penalty), I have an advantage by rejecting and making my own proposal next round. This means Alice has more incentive to reach an agreement sooner than I do.

I'll reject this offer and make my own proposal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer while considering the inflation effect. Since Alice faces 5% inflation per round but I don't, I have some negotiating leverage, but I still want to be fair enough that she'll accept.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor. This accounts for the inflation advantage I have while still giving Alice a substantial portion that would be worth accepting now rather than risking further inflation in later rounds."
