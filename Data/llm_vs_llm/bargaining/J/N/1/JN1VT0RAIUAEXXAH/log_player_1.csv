"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll play as Alice and propose an offer to divide $10,000 with Bob in Round 1.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I suggest a slightly favorable split for myself while still giving Bob a substantial portion. This acknowledges the 5% inflation penalty I'll face if we delay agreement, but still aims for a fair division that respects both our interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's 50-50 split offer. While I initially proposed a slightly better deal for myself, this equal division is fair, and accepting now prevents further loss of value due to inflation. If I were to reject and propose in the next round, I'd face additional 5% inflation, which would reduce the value of any potential gain."
