"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing I get $4,500 while she takes $5,500 of the $10,000. If I reject, I'll make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation.

If I reject and we continue to round 2, the total $10,000 would effectively be worth $9,500 to me due to the 5% inflation. So even if I proposed a better split in the next round, I need to account for this decrease in value.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a reasonable counter-offer that accounts for the inflation effect while trying to be fair.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an even 50-50 split of the money. This gives us both $5,000, which is a fair division of the total amount. Since I've already lost 5% value due to inflation, it's in my interest to reach an agreement soon, and I believe this equal split is a reasonable compromise that Alice should find acceptable."
