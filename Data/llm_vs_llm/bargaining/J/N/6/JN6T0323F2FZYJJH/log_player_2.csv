"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer is for me to get $400,000 while she gets $600,000 out of the $1,000,000 total.

Let me think about this carefully. If I reject, we go to round 2 where I make an offer, but the money is worth 5% less to me and 10% less to Alice. 

If I reject and we go to round 2:
- The $1,000,000 would be worth $950,000 to me (5% less)
- The $1,000,000 would be worth $900,000 to Alice (10% less)

I can make a better proposal in the next round that accounts for this depreciation. Since I'll lose less value than Alice in future rounds, I have leverage to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a proposal that accounts for the depreciation in value while being fair to both parties.

Since the money is worth 5% less to me and 10% less to Alice in this round, I should propose a division that recognizes this difference in depreciation rates while still being attractive enough for Alice to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because it gives me a better portion than Alice's initial offer while still giving Alice a substantial amount that would be worth accepting now rather than risking further depreciation in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has now offered me $450,000 while she takes $550,000. Let me evaluate this offer considering the current inflation effects:

Current inflation impact:
- For me: Money is worth 9.75% less than round 1
- For Alice: Money is worth 19% less than round 1

If I accept this offer:
- I get $450,000, which is worth about $406,125 in round 1 value to me
- Alice gets $550,000, which is worth about $445,500 in round 1 value to her

If I reject and go to round 4:
- Inflation will increase to 14.26% for me (another 5%)
- Inflation will increase to 27.1% for Alice (another 10%)

Alice has improved her offer from round 1, offering me $50,000 more than before. This suggests she's willing to negotiate. However, since her money depreciates faster than mine, I still have some leverage in future rounds.

Given that we're only in round 3 of 12 possible rounds, and considering Alice's faster depreciation rate, I think I can get a better deal by making another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice rejected my previous offer of 550k/450k but then countered with 450k/550k, I can see she's moving toward the middle. Given that Alice's money depreciates faster than mine (10% vs 5% per round), she has stronger incentive to reach agreement sooner.

In round 4:
- My money has depreciated by 14.26% total
- Alice's money has depreciated by 27.1% total

I'll propose a more balanced split that's still favorable to me but should be attractive enough for Alice to accept rather than continuing to later rounds where her money loses value faster.

{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000}

This offer gives Alice a meaningful improvement from my previous offer while still giving me a majority share. The faster depreciation of Alice's money means this deal should look increasingly attractive to her compared to continuing negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has now offered me $480,000 while she takes $520,000. Let me evaluate this carefully:

Current inflation impact:
- For me: Money is worth 18.55% less than round 1
- For Alice: Money is worth 34.39% less than round 1

If I accept this offer:
- I get $480,000, which is worth about $391,000 in round 1 value to me
- Alice gets $520,000, which is worth about $341,000 in round 1 value to her

If I reject and go to round 6:
- My inflation will increase to 22.62% (another 5%)
- Alice's inflation will increase to 40.95% (another 10%)

Looking at the negotiation pattern:
- Round 1: Alice offered 400k/600k
- Round 3: Alice offered 450k/550k
- Round 5: Alice is now offering 480k/520k

Alice has been steadily improving her offers to me, moving closer to a 50/50 split. Her current offer is quite reasonable considering where we started. Given that we're in round 5 of 12 and her money is depreciating much faster than mine, this offer of $480,000 is actually quite favorable to me in terms of relative value.
