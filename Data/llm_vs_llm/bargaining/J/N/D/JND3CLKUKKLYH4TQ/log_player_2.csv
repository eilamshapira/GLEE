"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I suggest a fair split of the money, with me taking 55% and you taking 45%. Given the 5% inflation rate per round, it's in both our interests to agree early. This offer gives you a significant portion of the money right now. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Alice is offering me 450,000$ (45%) while taking 550,000$ (55%)
2. If I reject, the next round's 1,000,000$ will be worth 10% less to me (effectively 900,000$)
3. In the next round, I could propose a split, but Alice might reject it, leading to further rounds and more value loss
4. My maximum potential in the next round would be proposing to keep most of the 900,000$ (effective value), but Alice might reject
5. 450,000$ guaranteed now is a significant amount
6. The difference between Alice's share and mine (100,000$) is relatively small compared to the risk of losing value through inflation

Given these factors, especially the guaranteed substantial amount and the risk of value loss through inflation, I'll accept this offer.
