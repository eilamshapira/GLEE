"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to factor in the inflation for me, but I don't know how it affects Bob. To be safe, I'll start with a relatively generous offer, hoping for a quick agreement.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob's offer is 50/50. Let's consider the situation. For me, the money is worth 20% less, so 50$ is effectively worth 40$. Bob's money is worth 5% less, so 50$ is effectively worth 47.5$.

I'll accept this offer.
