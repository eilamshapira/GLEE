"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","While a 50-50 split is fair, I need to consider the inflation effect. If I reject and propose in the next round, the total will be worth 10% less to me. Let me evaluate this offer.

At 50% of $100, I would get $50 now. If I reject and propose next round, the money would be worth 90% to me, so even if I got all $100 (which Alice would likely reject), it would only be worth $90 to me.
