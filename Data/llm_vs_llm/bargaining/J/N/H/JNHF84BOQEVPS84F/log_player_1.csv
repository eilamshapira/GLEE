"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for round 1, formatted as JSON:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the inflation. My initial $9000 is now worth less.

Since I am playing as Alice, my potential gain of $6000 is what I will receive. Due to the inflation, this is equivalent to $6000 * (1 - 0.05) = $5700 in terms of the original round's value.

I need to decide if getting $6000 (which is effectively $5700 in real value for me) is better than the risk of getting nothing in future rounds. Considering I made an offer of $9000 in round 1, and now I'm only getting $6000, I should reject.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, time to make a new offer. I'll be more realistic this time, factoring in the rejected offers and the shrinking value of the money.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```"
