"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a strategic first offer. Given that Bob's money loses value faster than mine (10% vs 5% per round), he has more incentive to accept an early offer. However, I don't want to be too aggressive and risk rejection.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

This is a fair 60-40 split in my favor, acknowledging that I have the first-mover advantage but still giving Bob a substantial portion. If Bob rejects this, the total value will decrease for both of us, with his portion decreasing faster."
