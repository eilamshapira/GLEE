"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze this offer.

*   **Bob's gain:** $400,000
*   **Alice's gain:** $600,000

Since it is round 1, the money has not yet depreciated.

I need to consider the following:

1.  **Is $400,000 a good starting point?** I need to secure at least a significant portion of the money, especially considering the depreciation in later rounds.
2.  **If I reject, I propose in the next round.** However, the money will be worth 10% less to me.
3.  **If Alice rejects my proposal in round 2, she will make the proposal in round 3,** but the money will be worth 5% less to her.

Let's calculate the potential value of this amount after 12 rounds of depreciation:
Value of Bob's gain after 11 rounds of depreciation = 400000 * (0.9) ^ 11 = 125414.25

Since Bob is in the bad position of having the money depreciate twice as fast, accepting this offer will let Bob keep the majority of the wealth after the game is over.
