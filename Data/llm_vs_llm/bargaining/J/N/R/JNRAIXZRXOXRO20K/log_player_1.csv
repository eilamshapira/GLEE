"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to propose a division of $100 to Bob, keeping in mind the dwindling value of the money for me with each round due to inflation. I need to make an offer that is attractive enough for Bob to accept, but also maximizes my potential gain, especially considering the potential 12-round limit.

Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

Explanation: I'm proposing I take $60 and Bob gets $40. This is a slightly advantageous offer for me, but hopefully not so greedy that Bob rejects it outright in the first round. Getting something in the first round, even if it's not a perfect 50/50 split, is better than potentially getting nothing if we reach round 12."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob rejected my initial offer and is now proposing a 50/50 split. My money is worth 10% less this round, so $50 this round is equivalent to $45 from round 1.

Here's my reasoning:

*   **Bob's offer:** Bob's offer of $50 is equivalent to round 1 value for Bob.
*   **My opportunity cost:** If I reject and go to round 3, I will get to propose, but my money will be worth 20% less than round 1. I need to decide if I can realistically get a better than a 50/50 deal (in round 1 equivalent value) in the next round to make it worthwhile.

Given the risk of further delays and inflation, and the possibility that Bob's ""fair"" offer might be a baseline for future negotiations, I will accept this offer.

```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```"
