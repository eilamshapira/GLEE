"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this... 

Alice is offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000, while she takes $600,000. That's a 40%-60% split in her favor.

If I reject, I'll make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 5% less to me (so the $1,000,000 is effectively worth $950,000 to me). For Alice, the money will be worth 20% less (so the $1,000,000 is effectively worth $800,000 to her).

Given the faster depreciation rate for Alice, I have some leverage in negotiations. If I reject this round, I can make a more favorable counter-offer. The significant difference in our inflation rates (5% vs 20%) means I should be able to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given our different inflation rates, I'll propose a more balanced division that accounts for the time pressure Alice faces (20% depreciation per round versus my 5%).

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I suggest a 55-45 split in my favor, considering that time affects your position more significantly than mine. This gives you a substantial amount now, avoiding further depreciation of your share."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me evaluate this new offer.

Alice has moved from her initial 40%-60% split to a 45%-55% split in her favor. This is more balanced, but still in her favor. 

I need to consider the inflation effects:
- For me, the money is now worth 9.75% less (after 2 rounds of 5% depreciation)
- For Alice, the money is worth 36% less (after 2 rounds of 20% depreciation)

Alice's position is weakening much faster than mine due to her higher inflation rate. If I reject, the next round will have money worth about 14.75% less for me, but 48.8% less for Alice - that's a significant difference.

Given this asymmetric pressure and the fact that we still have 9 rounds remaining, I believe I can get a better deal by rejecting this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given our different inflation rates and the increasing pressure on Alice (with her 20% depreciation per round compared to my 5%), I'll propose a more favorable split that acknowledges the time dynamics while still being reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This still gives you a substantial amount ($400,000) which is significantly better than continuing to negotiate as your share depreciates faster than mine. With your 20% depreciation rate per round, waiting longer substantially reduces your effective gain."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me evaluate this offer carefully.

Alice has now offered a perfectly even 50-50 split. This is more favorable than her previous offers.

The inflation effects are becoming significant:
- For me, money is now worth 18.55% less (after 4 rounds)
- For Alice, money is worth 59.04% less (after 4 rounds)

This means Alice's effective value of the $1,000,000 has dropped to about $409,600, while mine is still at $814,500.

If I reject:
- We go to round 6
- My inflation increases to about 23.55%
- Alice's inflation increases to about 67.23%

Alice's position is deteriorating much more quickly. A 50-50 split is fair on the surface, but given our different inflation rates and the fact that we're less than halfway through our rounds, I believe I can secure a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given our progression through the negotiations and the significant inflation disadvantage Alice faces (59% depreciation for her versus my 18.55%), I'll propose a deal that reflects this reality while still being acceptable.

{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000}

I propose a 65-35 split. With your accelerating depreciation rate of 20% per round compared to my 5%, this offer gives you $350,000 which is more valuable than what you might receive after further rounds of negotiation. The gap in our bargaining positions is widening with each round, and this offer recognizes that reality while still providing you with a substantial portion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

Alice has improved her offer to a 55-45 split in my favor. This is better than the previous 50-50 offer.

Current inflation effects:
- For me: 26.49% less value (after 6 rounds)
- For Alice: 73.79% less value (after 6 rounds)

This means the total $1,000,000 is effectively worth about $735,100 to me but only $262,100 to Alice right now.

If I reject:
- We move to round 8
- My inflation increases to about 30.17%
- Alice's inflation increases to about 79.03%

Alice's bargaining position is severely weakened due to her much higher depreciation rate. While the 55-45 split is better than before, given the extreme difference in our inflation rates and that we still have 5 more potential rounds, I believe I can secure an even better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given the significant inflation disparity (my 26.49% versus Alice's 73.79%), and considering we're now two-thirds through our negotiation window, I'll make an offer that reflects our relative bargaining positions while providing a path to resolution.

{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}

I propose a 70-30 split. Alice, with your 20% per round depreciation rate, your position weakens substantially with each round. At this point, $300,000 now is worth more to you than potentially more money after several more rounds of severe depreciation. This offer acknowledges the time pressure you face while still allowing you to secure a meaningful portion of the total sum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 83.22% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze Alice's latest offer:

Alice has improved her offer to a 60-40 split in my favor, up from the previous 55-45 split.

Current inflation effects after 8 rounds:
- For me: 33.66% less value
- For Alice: 83.22% less value

This means the $1,000,000 is effectively worth about $663,400 to me but only $167,800 to Alice at this point.

We have 3 more rounds after this one. If I reject:
- We move to round 10
- My inflation increases to about 36.98%
- Alice's inflation increases to about 86.58%

The gap in our positions continues to widen dramatically. Alice's effective value of the money is severely diminished.

The 60-40 split is getting better, but given Alice's extreme inflation disadvantage and our limited remaining rounds, I believe I should continue to negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering we now have only two rounds remaining after this one, and the extreme inflation asymmetry (my 33.66% versus Alice's 83.22% devaluation), I'll make what should be a compelling final offer.

{""bob_gain"": 750000, ""alice_gain"": 250000}

I propose a 75-25 split. Alice, at this point the money has lost over 83% of its value for you, and if we continue to round 12, you risk getting nothing. With your 20% per round depreciation rate, even $250,000 now is substantially more valuable than a potentially larger amount after further severe depreciation. This offer acknowledges the reality of our different positions while still providing you with a quarter of the total sum, which is meaningful given your current effective value of the pool."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.13% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 89.26% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 650000 
# Alice gain: 350000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me carefully evaluate this situation:

Alice has improved her offer to a 65-35 split in my favor, up from 60-40.

Current inflation effects after 10 rounds:
- For me: 40.13% less value
- For Alice: 89.26% less value

This means the $1,000,000 is effectively worth about $598,700 to me but only $107,400 to Alice at this point.

We have only 1 more round after this one. If I reject:
- We move to the final round (12)
- My inflation increases to about 43.12%
- Alice's inflation approaches 91.41%
- If we don't agree in round 12, we both get nothing

Given that:
1. We're at the penultimate round
2. Alice's bargaining position is extremely weak due to the 89.26% depreciation
3. The risk of getting nothing if we don't agree in the final round

A 65-35 split is still not optimal given our relative positions, but the risk of walking away with nothing is significant if I push too hard in the final round.

However, since I have one more opportunity to make an offer, and Alice would face an even worse depreciation in the final round, I'll take that chance.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 11.
Round 12
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","This is the final round. If we don't reach an agreement now, we both get nothing. Given the extreme inflation asymmetry (my 40.13% versus Alice's 89.26% devaluation), I'll make a firm but reasonable final offer.

{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000}

I propose an 80-20 split. Alice, with your 89.26% depreciation, $200,000 now is worth approximately $21,480 in original value terms to you, which is still better than getting nothing. At this point, any deal is better than no deal for both of us. This offer acknowledges our dramatically different bargaining positions while still ensuring you walk away with a meaningful amount. I urge you to accept, as rejection means we both receive nothing."
