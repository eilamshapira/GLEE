"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that I need to consider the 5% inflation penalty per round for my share, I'll make a reasonable first offer that gives Bob a good portion while securing a fair amount for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this 60-40 split because it's fair and gives Bob a significant portion while protecting my interests against potential future inflation if we go to more rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept Bob's offer, I get $4,500 Ã— 0.95 = $4,275 in effective value (due to 5% inflation)
2. If I reject and make a new offer in round 3, any amount I get will be worth 10% less due to inflation
3. Bob might reject my next offer, leading to even more rounds and inflation

Given that $4,275 is still a substantial amount, and the risk of further devaluation through additional rounds makes future negotiations less favorable for me, I should accept this offer.
