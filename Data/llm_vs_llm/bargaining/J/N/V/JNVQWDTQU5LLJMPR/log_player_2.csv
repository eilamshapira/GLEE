"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. 

Alice is offering me $4,000 out of the $10,000, which is 40% of the total. While this isn't an even split, I should consider the inflation aspect of this game. If I reject, we go to the next round where I can make a counter-offer, but the money will be worth 5% less to Alice (though it maintains full value for me).

This gives me some negotiating leverage in the next round. I could potentially make a more favorable offer for myself that Alice might still accept due to the diminishing value to her.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice's value for the money decreases by 5% each round, I can use this to negotiate a more favorable split while still keeping it attractive enough for her to accept. I'll aim for a fair division that accounts for this inflation factor.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I'm proposing that I receive $5,500 and Alice receives $4,500. This is a more balanced split than her initial offer, and considering that the money is now worth 5% less to her than in the previous round, this should still be reasonably valuable to her. If she rejects and we go to the next round, her money will lose another 5% in value, which creates an incentive for her to accept this offer."
