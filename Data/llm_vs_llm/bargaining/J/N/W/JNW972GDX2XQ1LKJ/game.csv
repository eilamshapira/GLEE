737856.0,262144.0,"Hi Bob – I’m offering you $262144 and I keep $737856. If you reject, you’d be in line to propose next round, but given the 20% discount that kicks in for you each round, your future value falls to about $262144 in round 2. I believe this is a fair, efficient split. Let’s settle now!",Alice,1,

488000.0,512000.0,"Alice, considering the inflation affecting me, I think a fair split now would be for me to take $512000 and you take $488000. This way, we both get a reasonable amount, and I can mitigate the effects of inflation. Let's settle this round!",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob – thanks for the offer, but I’m inclined to reject it. Given that my share retains full value in future rounds, I'm optimistic that by becoming the proposer next round I can secure a proposal that will leave me with a higher effective payout. I look forward to making my proposal in Round 3.",Alice,2,reject
200000.0,800000.0,"Hi Bob – here’s my proposal for Round 3. Nominally, you’d receive $800000 and I’d receive $200000. Remember that while my portion today has full value, your dollars are discounted by 0.8 per round. In Round 3 your money is worth 0.8² = 0.64 of its nominal value. This means that if you wait until Round 4 to propose, even if you could claim nearly the entire million, you’d effectively get about 1000000 × 0.8³ ≈ $512000 in today’s terms. My proposal ensures that by accepting now you secure an effective value of 800000 × 0.64 = $512000 – essentially matching what you could expect by waiting. It’s a fair division given our differing discount factors, so let’s settle now.",Alice,3,
