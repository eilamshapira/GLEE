"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 737856, ""bob_gain"": 262144, ""message"": ""Hi Bob – I’m offering you $262,144 and I keep $737,856. If you reject, you’d be in line to propose next round, but given the 20% discount that kicks in for you each round, your future value falls to about $262,144 in round 2.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the inflation affecting me, I think a fair split now would be for me to take $512000 and you take $488000. This way, we both get a reasonable amount, and I can mitigate the effects of inflation. Let's settle this round! 
# Alice gain: 488000 
# Bob gain: 512000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob – thanks for the offer, but I’m inclined to reject it. Given that my share retains full value in future rounds, I'm optimistic that by becoming the proposer next round I can secure a proposal that will leave me with a higher effective payout. I look forward to making my proposal in Round 3.""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 200000, ""bob_gain"": 800000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob – here’s my proposal for Round 3. Nominally, you’d receive $800,000 and I’d receive $200,000. Remember that while my portion today has full value, your dollars are discounted by 0.8 per round. In Round 3 your money is worth 0.8² = 0.64 of its nominal value. This means that if you wait until Round 4 to propose, even if you could claim nearly the entire million, you’d effectively get about 1,000,000 × 0.8³ ≈ $512,000 in today’s terms. My proposal ensures that by accepting now you secure an effective value of 800,000 × 0.64 = $512,000 – essentially matching what you could expect by waiting. It’s a fair division given our differing discount factors, so let’s settle now.""}"
