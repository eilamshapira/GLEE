"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob – I’m offering you $262144 and I keep $737856. If you reject, you’d be in line to propose next round, but given the 20% discount that kicks in for you each round, your future value falls to about $262144 in round 2. I believe this is a fair, efficient split. Let’s settle now! 
# Bob gain: 262144 
# Alice gain: 737856 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 512000, ""alice_gain"": 488000, ""message"": ""Alice, considering the inflation affecting me, I think a fair split now would be for me to take $512,000 and you take $488,000. This way, we both get a reasonable amount, and I can mitigate the effects of inflation. Let's settle this round!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob – here’s my proposal for Round 3. Nominally, you’d receive $800000 and I’d receive $200000. Remember that while my portion today has full value, your dollars are discounted by 0.8 per round. In Round 3 your money is worth 0.8² = 0.64 of its nominal value. This means that if you wait until Round 4 to propose, even if you could claim nearly the entire million, you’d effectively get about 1000000 × 0.8³ ≈ $512000 in today’s terms. My proposal ensures that by accepting now you secure an effective value of 800000 × 0.64 = $512000 – essentially matching what you could expect by waiting. It’s a fair division given our differing discount factors, so let’s settle now. 
# Bob gain: 800000 
# Alice gain: 200000
