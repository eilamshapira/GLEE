Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after each round, I'll make a more generous offer to Alice to increase the chances of her accepting it.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is on my side, let's adjust the split! 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $350,000 is actually worth around $560,000 in the first round's value (since it's 36% less, or 0.64 of the original value). This is still a relatively low amount. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better split.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 36% less for me (or 0.64 of the original value) after 3 rounds, and it will continue to decrease, I'll make a more generous offer to Alice to increase the chances of her accepting it.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is running out, and inflation is on my side. Let's end this! 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $300,000 is actually worth around $123,000 in the first round's value (since it's 59.04% less, or 0.4096 of the original value, approximately). This is a very low amount. However, I also need to consider that the value will continue to decrease, and I might end up with nothing if we don't reach an agreement. I'll reject this offer, but I should start thinking about accepting a less favorable deal soon.

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 59.04% less for me after 5 rounds, and it will continue to decrease, I'll make a very generous offer to Alice to increase the chances of her accepting it. I'm willing to give up a significant portion of the original value to get something.

# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $250,000 is actually worth around $66,000 in the first round's value (since it's 73.79% less, or 0.2621 of the original value, approximately). This is an extremely low amount. However, I have to be realistic about my situation. The value will continue to decrease, and I might end up with nothing if we don't reach an agreement. At this point, accepting a less favorable deal might be better than risking everything.
