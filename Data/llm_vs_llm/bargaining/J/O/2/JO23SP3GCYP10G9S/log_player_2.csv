"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice offered me 4000$ while keeping 6000$ for herself. If I reject this offer, I can make a counter-proposal in the next round. Since Alice faces a 10% devaluation per round, her 6000$ would only be worth 5400$ to her in the next round.

This gives me leverage to make a better offer in Round 2, as she would be more inclined to accept a lower amount rather than face further devaluation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice faces a 10% devaluation each round, I can use this to negotiate a better deal. In this round, $10,000 is still worth full value to me, but only worth $9,000 to Alice.

I'll propose a more favorable split for myself, but one that Alice should still rationally accept given the devaluation she faces. If she rejects, her next round will face another 10% devaluation.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

I propose this split because while 4000$ is less than her original offer, it's worth $4000 to her now, which is better than risking another round where even $6000 would only be worth $3600 to her due to further devaluation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is now offering me 4500$ (up from her initial 4000$ offer)
2. For Alice, the 5500$ she's asking for is actually only worth 4455$ (5500$ * 0.81) due to the 19% devaluation
3. If I reject, we go to round 4 where:
   - I can make another offer
   - Alice will face 29% devaluation (another 10%)
   - This will significantly weaken her negotiating position

Given that I can likely get an even better deal in the next round due to Alice's increasing devaluation penalty, and the fact that I don't face any devaluation myself:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Now I'm in a strong position. For Alice, any amount she receives is worth 29% less than in round 1 due to compounding devaluation. This means if she rejects this offer and we go to another round, she'll face an even steeper 39% devaluation.

Let me calculate strategically:
- Alice needs to compare what I offer now vs. what she might get next round (with additional 10% devaluation)
- I should offer an amount that's better for her to accept now than to risk another round
- I can push for a more favorable split given her weakened position

{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000}

This 3000$ for Alice is actually worth 2130$ to her now (due to 29% devaluation). If she rejects and we go another round, even a larger amount would be worth significantly less to her due to the additional 10% devaluation. Therefore, this should be a rational offer for her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is offering a 50-50 split (5000$ each)
2. For Alice, her 5000$ is actually only worth 3280.50$ (5000$ * 0.6561) due to the 34.39% devaluation
3. If I reject, we go to round 6 where:
   - I can make another offer
   - Alice will face about 44.39% devaluation (another 10%)
   - My money still maintains full value

However, this negotiation has been going on for several rounds, and Alice has shown she's willing to endure significant devaluation. While I could theoretically get a better deal by rejecting, there's also a risk of prolonging the negotiation without much additional benefit. The current offer gives me a fair amount, and Alice is already taking a significant hit due to devaluation.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept this offer because:
1. I get a respectable 5000$
2. Further negotiation might lead to diminishing returns
3. The risk of continued rejection might not be worth the potential marginal gain"
