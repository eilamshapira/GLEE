"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"":8000,""bob_gain"":2000,""message"":""I propose that I take 80% and you take 20%. This way, both of us get something, and I still maximize my gain in this first round.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  It's better than nothing, and I'm sure you value something over nothing. Let's end this now. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
