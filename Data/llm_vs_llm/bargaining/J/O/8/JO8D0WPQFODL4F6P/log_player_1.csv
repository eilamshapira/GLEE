"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, to keep our gains secure against any unforeseen inflation effects on your side, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor: $5500 for me and $4500 for you. Accepting this offer now avoids further delays and potential losses for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 20% inflation on my side, $4500 would actually be worth $3600 to me.
In the next round, I could propose again, but my gains would be worth another 20% less.

Even if I made a more aggressive proposal in the next round, Bob might reject it, leading to further rounds and more inflation losses for me.

Given these circumstances, while the split isn't ideal, delaying further would likely lead to worse outcomes for me due to the compounding inflation effect.
