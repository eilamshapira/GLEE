"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to conclude this quickly, and you'll get a substantial amount right away without risking value loss due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This is more equitable than your previous offer, and since I don't face any inflation penalties, we could keep going back and forth - but this is a fair deal that gives us both a substantial amount. Let's conclude this efficiently. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
* If I accept now, I get $450,000, but it's worth 10% less due to inflation, so effectively $405,000
* If I reject and make a counter-offer, any amount I get will be worth another 10% less
* Bob knows he's not affected by inflation, which gives him leverage
* Given this asymmetric inflation effect, the deal isn't getting better for me in future rounds
* $405,000 is still a substantial amount, and better than risking further depreciation
