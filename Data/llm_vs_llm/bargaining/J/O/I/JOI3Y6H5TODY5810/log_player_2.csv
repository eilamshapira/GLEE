"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to conclude this quickly, and you'll get a substantial amount right away without risking value loss due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me $400,000, which is a significant amount. However, I know that:
1. The total sum is $1,000,000
2. I don't lose any value to inflation in future rounds
3. I can make a counter-offer in the next round if I reject

Since I don't face any inflation penalty, there's no rush for me to accept a below-50% split. I can safely reject this and make a more favorable counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer, but still with a slight advantage to me since I'm now the proposer.

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This is more equitable than your previous offer, and since I don't face any inflation penalties, we could keep going back and forth - but this is a fair deal that gives us both a substantial amount. Let's conclude this efficiently.""}"
