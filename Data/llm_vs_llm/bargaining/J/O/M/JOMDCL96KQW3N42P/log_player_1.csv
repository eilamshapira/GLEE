"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, a balanced approach! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same, but Bob's gain is worth 20% less, I can consider this as an advantage. However, the split is even, which might not be in my favor considering I'm the one who made the initial offer.

Given the circumstances, I think I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better split in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was an even split, and considering the inflation effect on his gain, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself while still being reasonable.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 650000,
  ""bob_gain"": 350000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's adjust the split to reflect the changing value.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a slight adjustment in our split, aiming for a nearly equal share! 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect on Bob's gain increasing to 48.8%, his offer of $480,000 is significantly devalued. Considering this, the split is more in my favor than it initially appears.

Given the circumstances, I think I'll accept this offer, as the devalued amount Bob receives tips the scales in my favor.
