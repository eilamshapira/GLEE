6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose to split the $10000 by giving myself $6000 and you $4000. By settling in Round 1, we avoid any inflation loss for me (and possibly for you, if your money depreciates similarly). I believe this is a fair starting point to ensure a prompt agreement. Looking forward to your response!",Alice,1,
