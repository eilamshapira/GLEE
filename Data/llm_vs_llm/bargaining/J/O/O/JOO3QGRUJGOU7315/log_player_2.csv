"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose to split the $10000 by giving myself $6000 and you $4000. By settling in Round 1, we avoid any inflation loss for me (and possibly for you, if your money depreciates similarly). I believe this is a fair starting point to ensure a prompt agreement. Looking forward to your response! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. This is Round 1, so there's no inflation effect yet
2. Alice is offering me $4000 (40%) while taking $6000 (60%)
3. If I reject, my next offer will be worth 20% less to me
4. However, I could potentially negotiate for a better split by making a counter-offer
5. With 12 rounds available, I have some room to negotiate, but need to be mindful of the inflation penalty

Given that:
- The split isn't terribly unfair
- Inflation will hurt my position in future rounds
- There's risk in prolonged negotiation
- Getting $4000 now is better than potentially getting a higher nominal amount that's worth less due to inflation
