"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, the money is now worth 20% less to me, so the total amount I'm considering is $100 * 0.8 = $80. I'll make an offer that gives me a bit more than half of this reduced amount.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 64% of its original value to me (100% - 20% - 20% = 60% of the value after the first round, but it seems there was an additional reduction, so 100 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 64). 

Given Alice's offer of $45 for me, this is equivalent to 45 / 0.64 = approximately $70.31 in the original value. Since this is more than half of the original $100 and considering the reduced value due to inflation, I will accept this offer.
