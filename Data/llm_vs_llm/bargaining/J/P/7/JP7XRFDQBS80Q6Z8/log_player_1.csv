"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}
``` 

Reasoning: 

* **Time Pressure:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me. It's crucial to secure a deal soon.
* **Bob's Declining Share:** While the money is losing value for Bob too, it's at a slower rate. My offer in this round is designed to be tempting enough for him to accept, knowing his potential share diminishes in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Reasoning:

While not ideal, accepting this offer is the safest option at this point:

* **Dwindling Value:** The money is losing value rapidly. Waiting another round significantly risks getting even less.
* **Bob's Position:** Bob knows I'm feeling the pressure of inflation more acutely. It's unlikely he'll offer significantly more in subsequent rounds.  

Taking 55% now, though diminished in value, is better than gambling on a less favorable outcome later."
