"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me propose a fair split while accounting for potential future inflation if negotiations extend.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}

I propose I get $5,200 and Bob gets $4,800. This is close to an even split but gives me a small buffer against potential inflation if Bob declines and we need more rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

The offer is $4,800 for me, but due to 5% inflation, it's actually worth $4,560 to me now. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount I get will be worth another 5% less, and there's no guarantee Bob will accept.

Given that this is still a reasonably fair split (even with inflation considered) and that delaying further will only reduce the value for me, I should accept this offer.
