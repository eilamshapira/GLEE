"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Let me think about a fair offer for Bob. I need to consider that each round costs me 20% of the value, while Bob doesn't lose any value with delays.

Given this asymmetry, I should make a reasonable first offer that Bob is likely to accept.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""I'm proposing an equal 50-50 split, which I think is fair to both of us. Note that if we go to another round, the total value is worth less to me due to inflation, so we both benefit from agreeing now.""
}
```"
