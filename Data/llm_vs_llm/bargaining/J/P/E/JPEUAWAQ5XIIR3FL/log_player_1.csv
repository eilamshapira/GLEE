"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $600,000 and giving Bob $400,000, with a message suggesting this is a fair starting point. Your turn to respond as Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a more balanced split, considering the inflation I'm facing. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $450,000, but its value will be 20% less than the original amount, so I'll effectively get 0.8 * $450,000 = $360,000.

Since Bob's offer gives me less than half of the original amount, and considering the inflation, I think I can try to negotiate a better deal.

My response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less with each passing round, and we're now in Round 3, the effective value of the money I'll receive will be:

0.8 (Round 1) * 0.8 (Round 2) * 0.8 (Round 3) = 0.512

So, if I offer myself $X, its effective value will be 0.512 * $X.

Considering this, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground, considering the inflation we're both facing.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $520,000 and giving Bob $480,000, with a message suggesting we find a compromise. Your turn to respond as Bob!"
