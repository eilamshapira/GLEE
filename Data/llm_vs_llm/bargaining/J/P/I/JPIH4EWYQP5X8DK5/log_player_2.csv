"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first move. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if this is a fair offer, or if I should make a counter-proposal.

Alice is offering me 40% ($4,000) while keeping 60% ($6,000) for herself. If I reject, we move to round 2 where I can make an offer, but the total amount will be worth 20% less ($8,000). 

If I reject and propose a 50-50 split in round 2, I'd get $4,000 and Alice would get $4,000. This would be the same amount for me as accepting now, but less for Alice. She might reject, leading to further inflation.

Given that we both need to reach an agreement and Alice made a reasonable first offer, I'll accept rather than risk further depreciation.
