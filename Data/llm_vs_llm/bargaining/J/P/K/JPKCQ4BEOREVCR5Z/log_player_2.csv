"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

* The total amount is $1,000,000
* Alice is offering me $350,000 and keeping $650,000
* If I reject and go to next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me
* In the next round, I could make a proposal, but any further delays would reduce my purchasing power
* If I reject, my $350,000 would effectively become worth $280,000 in the next round

While this isn't an even split, accepting $350,000 now is better than risking getting less in future rounds due to inflation. The inflation penalty creates pressure to reach an agreement quickly.
