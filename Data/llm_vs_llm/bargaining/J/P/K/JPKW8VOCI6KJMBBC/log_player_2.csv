"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 55/45 split in my favor because I face a 5% inflation penalty with each round. If we delay, the total value decreases for me. This way, we both get a good portion and can finish now without losing value. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Alice claims she faces inflation, but I know for sure that I face 5% inflation per round. If I reject, in the next round:
- The $100 will be worth $95 to me
- I can make my own offer
- But if we keep going, we both risk getting nothing after 12 rounds

Alice's offer gives me $45 right now, which is a decent amount. If I reject and offer a better split next round, even if I get $60, it would be worth $57 due to inflation, and Alice might reject it anyway.

$45 now seems better than risking further rounds with diminishing value.
