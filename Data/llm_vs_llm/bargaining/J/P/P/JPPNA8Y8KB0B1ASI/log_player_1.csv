"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer to Bob. I want to be fair but also get a good outcome for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm suggesting a slightly higher portion for myself, but Bob still gets a substantial amount. This is a reasonable starting point that respects both our interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 1000000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I see that Bob has started with an extreme offer. Let me propose something more reasonable.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm offering an equal split of the money, which is fair to both of us. This should be an attractive offer that respects both our interests equally."
