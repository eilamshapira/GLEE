"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is proposing that I (Bob) get $400,000 and she gets $600,000. I need to consider if this is fair given the inflation penalty I face.

With 20% inflation per round for me, waiting a round means my money is worth less. If I reject and propose next round, the $1,000,000 pot effectively becomes worth $800,000 to me.

Let me analyze: $400,000 now is better than potentially getting a larger nominal amount that's worth less due to my inflation penalty. Since I face a significant disadvantage with each passing round, and this is a reasonable first offer giving me 40% of the pot, I'll accept.
