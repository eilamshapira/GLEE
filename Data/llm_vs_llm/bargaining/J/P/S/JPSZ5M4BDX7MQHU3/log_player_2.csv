"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, by accepting this proposal, you secure the full face value of any money you receive—while waiting in subsequent rounds would mean a 10% loss for you each time. I am offering all $10000 to be split on my side because if we delay, you'll be worse off. I believe a swift agreement is in our mutual best interest. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 0 
# Alice gain: 10000

Round 2

{
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""message"": ""Alice, you proposed an unfair split. With each round, your offer becomes less appealing for me due to the 10% inflation. I'm offering a more equitable split this time. Take it or leave it.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, consider this: if you reject, you become the proposer in the next round but due to the inflation penalty you'll be forced into offering me nearly the entire amount—leaving you with nothing. Since your future alternative is effectively zero, I'm offering you a tiny token amount now, which is strictly better than nothing. Accept this offer, and we both conclude our negotiations immediately. 
# Bob gain: 0.01 
# Alice gain: 9999.99

Round 4

{
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""message"": ""Alice, this is the last reasonable offer. I am already taking a hit due to inflation. Take this offer before I decrease the amount I am offering you. It is still more than you'd get in the next round. Act now!""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, if you reject this offer, you'll become the proposer in round 6, but your money will then be discounted by an extra 10%—dropping your effective rate from 65.61% to 59.049% of its face value. In other words, accepting now gives you an effective payoff of about $9001 × 0.6561 ≈ $5905, which beats the roughly $5904.90 you'd get next round. This offer is slightly better for you than waiting, so I urge you to accept now and avoid further value loss. 
# Bob gain: 9001 
# Alice gain: 999
