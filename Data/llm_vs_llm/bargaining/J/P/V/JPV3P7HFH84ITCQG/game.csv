600000.0,400000.0,Let's start with a fair split. This offer gives you a substantial amount while ensuring we both benefit. Consider accepting to avoid the value decrease in future rounds.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"I propose a fair 50-50 split. This is the most equitable solution, and we should agree now before inflation reduces our total value. We both walk away with a substantial amount.",Bob,2,
,,"I appreciate the fair split, but considering the inflation, I believe we can find a better division in the next rounds. Let's continue negotiating.",Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Given the inflation, I'm willing to adjust my offer slightly. This still provides a fair split while considering the decreasing value of the money. Let's agree soon to maximize our gains.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
520000.0,480000.0,"We've already lost significant value to inflation. This is a very reasonable 48-52 split that slightly favors you. If we don't agree soon, we'll both lose much more to inflation. Let's conclude this now and both walk away with a good outcome.",Bob,4,
