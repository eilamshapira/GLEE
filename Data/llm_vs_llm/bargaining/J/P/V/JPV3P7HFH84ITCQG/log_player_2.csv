"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. This offer gives you a substantial amount while ensuring we both benefit. Consider accepting to avoid the value decrease in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
* She's offering me $400,000 out of $1,000,000
* That's a 40-60 split in her favor
* If I reject, the total value will decrease by 20% to $800,000 for the next round
* However, I'll get to make the next offer
* A 50-50 split would be $500,000 each, so she's offering me $100,000 less than that
* Even with the 20% decrease, I could potentially get more by making a counter-offer

I think I can get a better deal, and I'm willing to risk the 20% depreciation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split while acknowledging the risk of further depreciation:

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. This is the most equitable solution, and we should agree now before inflation reduces our total value. We both walk away with a substantial amount.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given the inflation, I'm willing to adjust my offer slightly. This still provides a fair split while considering the decreasing value of the money. Let's agree soon to maximize our gains. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
* Alice is now offering me $450,000 (up from her initial $400,000)
* With 36% inflation, this $450,000 is actually worth $288,000 in round 1 terms
* If I reject, we'll face another 20% depreciation
* The next round will have 49% total depreciation
* The split is getting closer to 50-50, but the real value I'd receive is significantly less
* There's a risk of continued back-and-forth reducing the value further

However, I think I can still get a better deal. The inflation is significant, but Alice seems to be gradually improving her offers, and I'll have the next proposal if I reject.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given the significant inflation already incurred and the risk of further depreciation, I'll propose a split that gives Alice a slight advantage but is close to fair:

{""bob_gain"": 480000,
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""We've already lost significant value to inflation. This is a very reasonable 48-52 split that slightly favors you. If we don't agree soon, we'll both lose much more to inflation. Let's conclude this now and both walk away with a good outcome.""}"
