"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a fair split of $5,000 each. Accepting now prevents any devaluation that might occur in later rounds. Looking forward to a prompt agreement!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation affecting my share, I propose $6000 for me and $4000 for you. This offer balances our needs while addressing the devaluation issue. Let's settle this round! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550, ""bob_gain"": 9450, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand the inflation is increasingly impacting your share. In this round, I propose to take $550 and offer you $9,450. With your share being worth 10% less this round, your effective value comes to about $8,505—just a bit above what you might secure if you waited and became proposer next round. Let’s agree now to avoid further devaluation!""}"
