"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a fair split of $5000 each. Accepting now prevents any devaluation that might occur in later rounds. Looking forward to a prompt agreement!

# Alice gain: 5000

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering the inflation affecting my share, I propose $6000 for me and $4000 for you. This offer balances our needs while addressing the devaluation issue. Let's settle this round!""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand the inflation is increasingly impacting your share. In this round, I propose to take $550 and offer you $9450. With your share being worth 10% less this round, your effective value comes to about $8505—just a bit above what you might secure if you waited and became proposer next round. Let’s agree now to avoid further devaluation! 
# Bob gain: 9450 
# Alice gain: 550 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
