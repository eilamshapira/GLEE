"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I need to consider the actual value I'll get. 
20% of 4500 is 900, so the value I'll get is 4500 - 900 = 3600.
Considering this, I don't think it's a fair offer.
{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, the total value of the money is now:
For me: 10000 * (1 - 0.2)^2 = 10000 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 6400
For Bob: 10000 * (1 - 0.1)^2 = 10000 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 8100

I'll make an offer that takes into account the decreasing value for both of us.
