"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is proposing that I get $200,000 while she gets $800,000, which is a significantly uneven split in her favor. Given that inflation affects Alice's money by 20% each round but doesn't affect my money, I have an advantage by rejecting and making my own offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer, considering the inflation dynamics.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""explanation"": ""I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, recognizing that with each round, your money loses 20% of its value. This is a fair offer considering the inflation factor, and if we continue negotiating, both of us might end up with less value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has improved her offer from $200,000 to $400,000 for me, which shows we're moving in the right direction. However, since inflation doesn't affect my share and I still have multiple rounds to negotiate, I can aim for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""explanation"": ""I'm offering you $350,000, which is worth more now than a larger amount in future rounds due to the 20% inflation per round affecting your share. This is a reasonable compromise that acknowledges our negotiation progress.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has now offered an even 50/50 split. Given that we're in round 5 and her money is already worth 59.04% less due to inflation, this is becoming a more reasonable offer. However, since inflation doesn't affect my share and I still have negotiating rounds left, I'll continue to seek a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 680000, ""alice_gain"": 320000, ""explanation"": ""I'm offering you $320,000, which is a fair amount considering we're now in round 6 and your share is significantly affected by inflation. Taking this deal now preserves more value for you than waiting for later rounds.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has now offered me $600,000 (60% of the total), which is a substantial improvement from her previous offers. With only 5 rounds remaining and her money now worth 73.79% less due to inflation, this is becoming a very attractive offer. I should also consider that if we reach round 12 without agreement, we both get nothing.
