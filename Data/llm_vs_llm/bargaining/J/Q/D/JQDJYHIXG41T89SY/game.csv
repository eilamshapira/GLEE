4000.0,6000.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, which is exactly why I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Since your money loses 20% value each round, it's in your best interest to accept this offer now rather than continuing to negotiate. If we go to another round, your $4000 would effectively be worth only $3200 to you. This is a fair offer given the circumstances.",Bob,2,
