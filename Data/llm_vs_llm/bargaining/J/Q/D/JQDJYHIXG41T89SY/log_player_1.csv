"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering we both need to come to an agreement quickly, as delays will hurt my position more than yours due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, which is exactly why I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Since your money loses 20% value each round, it's in your best interest to accept this offer now rather than continuing to negotiate. If we go to another round, your $4000 would effectively be worth only $3200 to you. This is a fair offer given the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
