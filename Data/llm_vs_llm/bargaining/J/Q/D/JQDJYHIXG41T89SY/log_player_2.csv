"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering we both need to come to an agreement quickly, as delays will hurt my position more than yours due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's suggesting I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000.

Since there's 0% inflation for me, my $4,000 will be worth the same in future rounds. However, Alice faces 20% inflation per round, so delaying is costly for her.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, I could propose a more favorable split. Given her inflation pressure, she might accept even if I ask for more than $4,000.

Strategically, I should reject this initial offer and propose a better deal for myself in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that accounts for the inflation dynamics while still being reasonable enough for Alice to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, which is exactly why I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Since your money loses 20% value each round, it's in your best interest to accept this offer now rather than continuing to negotiate. If we go to another round, your $4,000 would effectively be worth only $3,200 to you. This is a fair offer given the circumstances.""}"
