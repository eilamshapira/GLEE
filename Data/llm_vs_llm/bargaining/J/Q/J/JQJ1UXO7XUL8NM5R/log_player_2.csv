"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice has offered a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance. However, I need to consider that if I reject and we go to the next round, the total value will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation.

If I reject:
- Next round I can make an offer, but the $10,000 will only be worth $9,000 to me
- Even if I ask for a larger share, Alice might reject and we'd lose another 10%
- There's risk in prolonging negotiations

If I accept:
- I get $5,000 right now
- No risk of further devaluation
- Guaranteed fair outcome

Given the inflation penalty and the risk of getting a worse deal later, accepting this fair split now seems like the rational choice.
