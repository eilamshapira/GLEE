"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully, taking into account the inflation aspect of this game.

If I reject this offer, we'll move to round 2, where I can make a counter-offer. However, due to inflation, the money will be worth 10% less to me and 20% less to Alice. 

Currently being offered: $40 for me, $60 for Alice.
If I reject, the total value becomes $90 for me ($100 - 10%) and $80 for Alice ($100 - 20%).

Given the asymmetric inflation and the fact that I'll be making the next offer if I reject, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a strategic offer, considering the inflation effects. Since we're in round 2, Alice is facing a 20% inflation penalty if she rejects my offer, while I'm facing a 10% penalty.

Given this asymmetry in inflation rates, I can propose a division that's more favorable to me while still being rational for Alice to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'm proposing that I receive $55 and Alice receives $45. This is better for me than the initial offer, and considering the inflation penalty Alice faces if she rejects (her money would be worth 20% less next round), this should be attractive enough for her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer carefully considering the current inflation.

In this round 3:
- If I accept: I get $30, which is worth only 81% of its original value (19% less) = $24.30 in round 1 value
- Alice gets $70, which is worth only 64% of its original value (36% less) = $44.80 in round 1 value

If I reject and we go to round 4:
- The money will be worth 29% less for me (another 10% drop)
- The money will be worth 56% less for Alice (another 20% drop)

This means the $100 total would be worth $71 to me and $44 to Alice in the next round.

Alice's offer is quite poor for me. Even with inflation, I should be able to make a better counter-offer in the next round that would benefit me more while still being acceptable to Alice given her higher inflation rate.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to make a strategic offer considering our current inflation situation.

At this point (round 4):
- For me, money is worth 29% less than original value
- For Alice, money is worth 56% less than original value

If Alice rejects this offer and we go to round 5:
- For me, money will be worth 39% less
- For Alice, money will be worth 76% less (almost worthless)

Since Alice is facing severe inflation if she rejects, I can offer a division that strongly favors me while still being rational for her to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35}

This offer gives me $65 (worth $46.15 in original value) and gives Alice $35 (worth only $15.40 in original value). However, if she rejects, her money in the next round would lose so much value that this is still her best option. The asymmetric inflation puts me in a stronger bargaining position at this point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully analyze this offer given our current inflation situation:

In this round 5:
- If I accept: I get $35, which is worth 65.61% of original value (34.39% less) = $22.96 in round 1 value
- Alice gets $65, which is worth 40.96% of original value (59.04% less) = $26.62 in round 1 value

If I reject and we go to round 6:
- Money will be worth 44.39% less for me (another 10% drop)
- Money will be worth 79.04% less for Alice (another 20% drop)

This means in round 6, the $100 total would be worth only $55.61 to me and just $20.96 to Alice.

Alice's inflation is becoming extremely severe. If we go to another round, her money loses most of its value. My counteroffer could be even more favorable to me due to this advantage.

However, the absolute value I'll receive is also declining with each round. I need to consider if it's worth the risk.

Given the steep inflation curve and the fact that my own purchasing power is declining, I think it's better to make one more counter-offer where I can likely get a significantly better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","At this stage, Alice's inflation is becoming extremely severe. In this round 6:
- My money is worth 44.39% less than original value
- Alice's money is worth 79.04% less than original value

If Alice rejects this offer, in round 7:
- My money will be worth 54.39% less
- Alice's money will be worth a staggering 99.04% less (essentially worthless)

Given that Alice faces such extreme inflation, she would be rational to accept almost any offer rather than proceed to round 7 where her money would have virtually no value.

{""bob_gain"": 80, ""alice_gain"": 20}

I'm offering Alice $20, which given her current inflation rate is worth about $4.19 in original value to her. Though this seems low, it's still much better than what she would get if we proceeded to round 7, where her share would be worth almost nothing. For me, the $80 is worth about $44.49 in original value, which is considerably better than any previous offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to analyze this carefully. There seems to be a discrepancy in the inflation rates mentioned.

In round 7:
- I'm told my money is worth 46.86% less (should be closer to 54.39% based on previous rounds)
- I'm told Alice's money is worth 73.79% less (should be closer to 99.04% based on previous rounds)

Regardless, let me evaluate the offer:

If I accept:
- I get $40, which is worth about $21.26 in original value (using the 46.86% discount)
- Alice gets $60, which is worth about $15.73 in original value (using the 73.79% discount)

If I reject and go to round 8:
- My money will be worth about 57% less
- Alice's money will be worth about 94% less

Given that we're several rounds in, and both our values are decreasing (though Alice's much faster), I should consider ending this negotiation. While I might get a better percentage in round 8, the absolute value keeps decreasing.

The $40 offer is the best Alice has made so far in absolute terms for me, and considering the inflation effects, this is probably a reasonable point to accept.
