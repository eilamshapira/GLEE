"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's not let the discount eat away our gains. If you accept this round, you'll secure an effective $46.30 (48.74×0.95) in value—which is at least as good as waiting for your turn in round 3. I believe this is a fair, prompt resolution for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 48.74 
# Bob gain: 51.26 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
