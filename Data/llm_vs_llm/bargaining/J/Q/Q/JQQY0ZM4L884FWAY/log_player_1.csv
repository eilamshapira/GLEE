"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. I'm Alice, and I want to maximize my gain, keeping in mind the time limit and the inflation risk. Here's my first offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

Rationale:

*   **Starting Strong:** I'm offering myself a larger share initially. This sets a precedent and attempts to anchor Bob's expectations.
*   **Leaving Enough for Bob:** Bob needs to feel like he's getting a reasonable deal, or he'll reject the offer. 40 is a significant amount.
*   **Inflation Awareness:** I'm trying to get a larger portion early, as my share will be worth less in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the situation. Bob rejected my initial offer and now he's proposing a split where he gets $55 and I get $45. Crucially, my $45 is now worth 10% less than it would have been in the first round.

Let's calculate the effective value of Bob's offer to me. My $45 is now worth $45 * 0.9 = $40.50 in round 1 dollars.

Considering the risks of further inflation and the time limit, I'll accept this offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Rationale:

*   **Diminishing Returns:** The longer this goes on, the less any money I receive will be worth.
*   **Risk Aversion:** While I could try to negotiate a better deal, there's a risk Bob will reject and we'll end up with nothing as the rounds progress. The inflation severely punishes prolonged negotiation for me.
*   **Acceptable Floor:** $40.50 (in round 1 value) is an acceptable return, given the circumstances. It's better to secure something than risk getting nothing."
