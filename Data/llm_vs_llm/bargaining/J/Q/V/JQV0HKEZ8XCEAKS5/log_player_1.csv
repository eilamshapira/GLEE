"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split while accounting for potential future inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. This is slightly in my favor but still quite fair, considering I need to protect against inflation if Bob rejects and we go to further rounds. If Bob accepts, we both walk away with a substantial amount right now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. Even with the 10% inflation penalty (meaning my $4,500 is effectively worth $4,050), this is still a reasonable amount. If I reject and we continue to later rounds, the inflation will keep reducing my purchasing power, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal. Better to secure a good amount now than risk further depreciation."
