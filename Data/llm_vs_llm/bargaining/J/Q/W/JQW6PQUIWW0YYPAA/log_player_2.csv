"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's keep this simple, I propose $950000 for me and $50000 for you. 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Alice after each round, I'll take that into account for my offer.

The total amount after the first round for me is $1,000,000 * 0.9 = $900,000, and for Alice, it's $1,000,000 * 0.95 = $950,000.

However, to make the division simpler, I'll still consider the original $1,000,000 for the division and keep in mind the decreasing value.

Here's my offer:
{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's be more fair about this, shall we?""}"
