4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, I know we both lose value as we delay further – you even lose at a 10% rate. To avoid more erosion (and guarantee you more than you might get later), I’m proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. This way, you secure 4500 immediately (worth 90% of it now), and I get 5500 (worth 95%). Let’s agree now rather than risk further losses. What do you say?",Bob,2,

3103.0,6897.0,"Alice, I know waiting diminishes our shares further – especially for you, since every round cuts 10% off your value. Based on our respective discount factors (mine 0.95 per round, yours 0.90), if we were to continue this back‐and‐forth the equilibrium outcome would give me roughly 69% of the pie and you about 31%. This offer reflects that exact calculation. Accepting now secures you a deal equal to your best alternative if you were to delay further. Let's settle and end our losses before they worsen.",Bob,4,
