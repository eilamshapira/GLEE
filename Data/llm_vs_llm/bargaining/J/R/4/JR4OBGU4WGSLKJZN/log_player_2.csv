Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, I know we both lose value as we delay further – you even lose at a 10% rate. To avoid more erosion (and guarantee you more than you might get later), I’m proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. This way, you secure 4500 immediately (worth 90% of it now), and I get 5500 (worth 95%). Let’s agree now rather than risk further losses. What do you say?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6897, ""alice_gain"": 3103, ""message"": ""Alice, I know waiting diminishes our shares further – especially for you, since every round cuts 10% off your value. Based on our respective discount factors (mine 0.95 per round, yours 0.90), if we were to continue this back‐and‐forth the equilibrium outcome would give me roughly 69% of the pie and you about 31%. This offer reflects that exact calculation. Accepting now secures you a deal equal to your best alternative if you were to delay further. Let's settle and end our losses before they worsen.""}"
