"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer that takes into account the different inflation rates we face.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. Since we both face inflation with each round (mine at 5% and Bob's at 10%), it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. This offer gives Bob a substantial portion while recognizing that my inflation penalty is lower, which slightly shifts the bargaining position in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The inflation impact doesn't make this offer favorable for me. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, I can propose a more equitable division that accounts for our different inflation rates."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more strategic offer considering our inflation rates.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, 
""bob_gain"": 4800}

I'm offering Bob $4,800 while I take $5,200. This is a more balanced proposal than my first offer and gives Bob a better deal than before. Given that we're now in round 3 and Bob faces higher inflation (10% per round versus my 5%), accepting this offer would be rational for him rather than continuing to negotiate as the value decreases more quickly for him than for me."
