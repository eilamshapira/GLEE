60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest we split the money 60-40. This is fair considering you face a 10% inflation per round, so the longer we negotiate, the less value the money has for you. If we continue to the next round, your $40 would only be worth $36 to you in real value, and even less in future rounds. Let's make a deal now and both walk away with value.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, given the inflation affecting my share, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor this round. Since my money loses 10% value each round, a quick agreement benefits us both. Let's settle now before my share devalues further.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, I appreciate your counterproposal. Let me meet you in the middle with a 55-45 split in my favor. This is fair considering the inflation pressure you face - if we go another round, your $45 would only be worth about $40.5 to you. Let's avoid further devaluation of your share and reach an agreement now that benefits us both.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
40.0,60.0,"Alice, considering the significant impact of inflation on my share, now at 19% less value, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. Each round further diminishes my portion, so it's crucial we agree soon. Let's settle on this to ensure we both walk away with meaningful value before it devalues even more.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
52.0,48.0,"Bob, we're getting closer to an agreement. I'm offering a 52-48 split which is very fair considering the inflation you face. At this point, your $48 is worth about $34.8 after inflation, but if we continue negotiating, your share will be worth even less. This is my best offer - it's reasonable and allows us both to walk away with good value before we risk getting nothing.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
35.0,65.0,"Alice, with my share now worth 34.39% less due to inflation, I need to adjust my proposal to a 65-35 split in my favor. The value of my portion is rapidly decreasing, and we're running out of time. Let's agree on this to ensure we both get something before it's too late.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
50.0,50.0,"Bob, we're now halfway through our negotiation rounds and both risking walking away with nothing. I'm offering a perfectly even 50-50 split. For you, this $50 is worth about $32.8 after inflation, but it's still substantial. If we continue, your share will keep devaluing. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our positions - let's reach an agreement now rather than risk getting nothing at all.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
30.0,70.0,"Alice, with my share now worth 46.86% less due to inflation, I must propose a 70-30 split in my favor. We're running out of rounds, and the value of my portion is critically low. Let's agree on this to ensure we both walk away with something before it's too late.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
45.0,55.0,"Bob, we only have a few rounds left before we both get nothing. I'm making a significant concession by offering you $55, which is actually more than a 50-50 split when accounting for inflation. At this point, your $55 is still worth about $32 to you, which is better than risking getting nothing. This is my final substantial offer - let's end this negotiation now and both walk away with something worthwhile.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
25.0,75.0,"Alice, with only three rounds left and my share now worth 56.95% less due to inflation, I need to propose a 75-25 split in my favor. The value of my portion is dangerously low, and we're close to losing everything. Let's agree on this to ensure we both get something before it's too late.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
40.0,60.0,"Bob, we're down to the last two rounds. I'm offering you $60, which is much more favorable to you than my previous offers. Even with the inflation you face, this gives you about $32 in real value. If we don't agree now, we're at serious risk of both walking away with nothing. This is my absolute final offer - a genuine compromise that acknowledges the inflation pressure you face. Please accept so we can both benefit.",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,reject
20.0,80.0,"Alice, this is our last chance. With my share now worth 65.13% less due to inflation, I propose an 80-20 split in my favor. It's critical we agree now to avoid losing everything. Let's settle on this to ensure we both walk away with something.",Bob,12,
