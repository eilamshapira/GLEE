"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split, let's be reasonable 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me 4000$ while taking 6000$ for herself, which isn't exactly a ""fair"" split as she claims. With inflation reducing the value by 5% each round, my 4000$ now is worth more than a potentially larger amount in later rounds. However, I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while acknowledging the time pressure we both face.

{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""I propose a true 50-50 split. This is fair for both of us, and we should act quickly before inflation reduces the value further.""
}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, 58-42 is more than fair now 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Alice is offering me 4200$, but with 9.75% inflation, it's actually worth about 3790$ to me
2. She knows about my inflation disadvantage and still isn't offering a truly fair split
3. However, if I wait more rounds, inflation will keep reducing my purchasing power
4. Getting 3790$ in real value now might be better than risking further devaluation

While I could reject and try for more, the inflation penalty is significant, and Alice seems to be negotiating strategically. I should probably take this offer before it gets worse.
