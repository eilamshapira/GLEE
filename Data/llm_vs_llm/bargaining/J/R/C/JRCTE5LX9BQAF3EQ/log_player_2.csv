"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a perfectly fair 50-50 split. This gives us both the same amount and we can conclude the negotiation right away. With inflation affecting the value each round, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement now. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing a 50-50 split, giving us each $5,000. This seems fair on the surface, but I need to remember that inflation will reduce the value by 20% each round if I reject. If I reject now and propose in the next round, even if I ask for more, the total value will be worth less to me.

Given the 20% inflation penalty per round for me, accepting a fair split now is likely better than trying to negotiate for more later when the money will be worth less.
