450000.0,550000.0,"Let's consider the long-term effects of our different inflation rates. While you face 10% inflation versus my 5%, a 55-45 split in my favor is actually fair when you calculate the expected value across multiple rounds. This way we both get significant value without needing to lose more to inflation through continued negotiation.",Bob,2,
