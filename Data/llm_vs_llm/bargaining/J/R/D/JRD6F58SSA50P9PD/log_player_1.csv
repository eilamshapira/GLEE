"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's consider the long-term effects of our different inflation rates. While you face 10% inflation versus my 5%, a 55-45 split in my favor is actually fair when you calculate the expected value across multiple rounds. This way we both get significant value without needing to lose more to inflation through continued negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000
