"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40 in my favor to account for the higher inflation rate I'm facing. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer, taking into account our different inflation penalties.

Alice is offering me $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for herself, justifying the uneven split based on her higher inflation rate (10% vs my 5%).

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value decreases - for me by 5% and for her by 10%. This means I'd be negotiating over $950,000 of value for me, and $900,000 of value for her.

Given that I could potentially negotiate a better percentage of a slightly smaller pie, and considering that the current offer gives me only 40% of the full amount, I'll reject this offer and make my own proposal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split that acknowledges our different inflation rates while giving us both a fair share.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Let's consider the long-term effects of our different inflation rates. While you face 10% inflation versus my 5%, a 55-45 split in my favor is actually fair when you calculate the expected value across multiple rounds. This way we both get significant value without needing to lose more to inflation through continued negotiation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given the inflation rates, let's split it 55-45 in my favor this time. This takes into account the devaluation of money over rounds and ensures we both get a fair share considering the long-term effects. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to analyze this offer carefully considering our current inflation situation.

After 2 rounds, the money has devalued for me by 9.75% and for Alice by 19%. If I reject this offer, we'll go to round 4 where the money will be worth even less for both of us.

Alice is now offering me $450,000 (45% of the total), which is better than her initial 40-60 split proposal. Taking into account our different inflation rates, this is approaching a fair offer.

If I reject and we continue to round 4, I'll face another 5% inflation (total 14.75% devaluation) and Alice will face another 10% inflation (total 29% devaluation), making the total sum worth significantly less for both of us.

Given that Alice has moved significantly from her initial proposal toward a more balanced split, and considering the accelerating inflation penalties, I'll accept this offer.
