"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll propose a fair split while considering that waiting will hurt both of us (me more than Bob).

    ""alice_gain"": 55,
    ""bob_gain"": 45,
    ""message"": ""I suggest a slightly favorable split for me since I'm making the first offer. If you reject, inflation will hurt both of us, especially me.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly to avoid further inflation. This way, we both get a fair share. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Due to 20% inflation for me, $50 is now worth only $40 to me
2. If I reject and make a new offer in round 3, any amount will be worth even less (another 20% less)
3. Even if I propose a more favorable split next round, the inflation will likely eat away any gains
