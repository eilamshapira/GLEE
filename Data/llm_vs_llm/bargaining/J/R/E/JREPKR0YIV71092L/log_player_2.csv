"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split it 60-40 in my favor. This way, we both get a significant amount. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

At this point, I'm getting $400,000 with no inflation impact yet. If I reject and we move to the next round, any amount I receive will be worth 10% less due to inflation. So if I were to get $500,000 in the next round, it would only be worth $450,000 to me.

While a 50-50 split might seem more ""fair"", Alice's 60-40 proposal isn't unreasonable for a first offer, and the inflation risk makes accepting more attractive. If we keep going back and forth trying to negotiate a better deal, we both risk losing value and potentially getting nothing after 12 rounds.
