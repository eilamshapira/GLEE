"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split, considering that inflation will reduce the value in future rounds if Bob rejects.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose a 50-50 split of the money. This is a fair and equitable division that respects both parties equally and has the best chance of being accepted immediately, avoiding any value loss due to inflation."
