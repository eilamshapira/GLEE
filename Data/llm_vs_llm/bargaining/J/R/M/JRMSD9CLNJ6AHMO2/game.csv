52.63,47.37,"Hi Bob, let's settle swiftly—I'm proposing that I receive $52.63 and you $47.37. This split reflects our future discounting (10% per round) and ensures we both secure a fair share without further loss in value. What do you say?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, since we're now in round 2 and the value has decreased by 10%, I propose a split of $55 for me and $45 for you. This accounts for the inflation and gives us a chance to end this quickly. What do you think?",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. However, considering that in the next round I'll have the chance to propose a division that, even when factoring in the further 10% discount, should secure me a slightly better return, I must reject your proposal.",Alice,2,reject
52.63,47.37,"Hi Bob, in light of our previous rounds and the ongoing 10% inflation per round, I propose a division based on our standard equilibrium split. This means I receive $52.63 and you receive $47.37 (both nominal amounts), which translate into effective values of about $42.63 for me and $38.37 for you given today’s discount factor. I believe this is fair considering that if you were to reject, as the proposer in round 4 you’d secure a similar—but further discounted—share. I hope we can wrap this up quickly.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
42.5,57.5,"Hi Alice, we're now in round 4, and the value has decreased by another 10%, making it 19% less than in round 1. Considering this, I propose a split of $57.50 for me and $42.50 for you. This reflects the ongoing inflation and aims to conclude our game swiftly. Let's end this round and secure our shares before they diminish further.",Bob,4,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your effort to keep the game moving fast. However, if I reject and become the proposer in round 5—even with an additional 10% discount—I expect to secure an offer that gives me an effective value above the approximately 30.98 I’d get from your current proposal. So, I'll reject this offer and look forward to presenting mine in the next round.",Alice,4,reject
52.63,47.37,"Hi Bob, considering that any delay only further erodes the value of our total pie, I'm offering the split that reflects our mutually optimal equilibrium. You receive $47.37 and I receive $52.63 of the nominal $100, which in today's round (with a 34.39% reduction in value relative to round 1) secures you a payoff equivalent to what you’d get if you waited to propose in round 6. I believe this is fair and we should conclude the game now. What do you say?",Alice,5,
