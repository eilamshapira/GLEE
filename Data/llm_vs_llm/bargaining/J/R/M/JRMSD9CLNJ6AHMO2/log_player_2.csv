"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's settle swiftly—I'm proposing that I receive $52.63 and you $47.37. This split reflects our future discounting (10% per round) and ensures we both secure a fair share without further loss in value. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 47.37 
# Alice gain: 52.63 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, since we're now in round 2 and the value has decreased by 10%, I propose a split of $55 for me and $45 for you. This accounts for the inflation and gives us a chance to end this quickly. What do you think?""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in light of our previous rounds and the ongoing 10% inflation per round, I propose a division based on our standard equilibrium split. This means I receive $52.63 and you receive $47.37 (both nominal amounts), which translate into effective values of about $42.63 for me and $38.37 for you given today’s discount factor. I believe this is fair considering that if you were to reject, as the proposer in round 4 you’d secure a similar—but further discounted—share. I hope we can wrap this up quickly. 
# Bob gain: 47.37 
# Alice gain: 52.63

Considering this, I propose a split of $57.50 for me and $42.50 for you. This reflects the ongoing inflation and aims to conclude our game swiftly. Let's end this round and secure our shares before they diminish further.""

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, considering that any delay only further erodes the value of our total pie, I'm offering the split that reflects our mutually optimal equilibrium. You receive $47.37 and I receive $52.63 of the nominal $100, which in today's round (with a 34.39% reduction in value relative to round 1) secures you a payoff equivalent to what you’d get if you waited to propose in round 6. I believe this is fair and we should conclude the game now. What do you say?

# Alice gain: 52.63
