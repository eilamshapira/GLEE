"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly and avoid losses due to inflation!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it equally, it's the fairest way. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I need to consider that when making my decision.

The original amount I would get is $5000, but due to 5% inflation, it's worth $5000 * 0.95 = $4750 to me.

Considering this, I think splitting it equally is a reasonable offer, especially since the value of the money will decrease further in subsequent rounds.
