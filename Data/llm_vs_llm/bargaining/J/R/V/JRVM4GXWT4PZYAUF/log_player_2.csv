"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $200,000 for me, $800,000 for Alice
2. If I reject, in the next round:
   * The money will be worth 20% less to me
   * The money will be worth 10% less to Alice
   * I can make my own proposal

This offer gives me only 20% of the total, which is quite low. Since I can make the next proposal and the inflation impact hurts Alice less than me, I should make a counter-offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me make a strategic offer:

The money is now worth:
- For me: 80% of original value
- For Alice: 90% of original value

I should propose a more balanced split, but accounting for the fact that Alice needs to find it attractive enough to accept (otherwise we'll both lose more value in the next round).

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

This gives me a better share while still leaving Alice with a significant portion. Given that she'll lose 10% value if she rejects, this should be appealing enough for her to accept."
