"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000. This seems a bit low, as it's only 40% of the total. Given that the money loses 5% of its value for me each round, if I reject and make a counter-offer, the total will effectively be worth $950,000 to me in the next round. 

If I reject and propose a more favorable split, Alice might accept a more balanced offer, potentially giving me more even after inflation. Let me reject this and make a counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more equitable division, considering both Alice's initial offer and the 5% inflation penalty I face.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split of the money. This is a balanced offer that gives us both equal shares, which is more equitable than the previous 40-60 split Alice proposed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has increased her offer to me from $400,000 to $420,000. However, due to inflation, the money is now worth 9.75% less to me than in the first round. 

Let me calculate the actual value to me:
$420,000 × (1 - 0.0975) = $420,000 × 0.9025 = $379,050

This is actually less valuable to me than her first offer ($400,000). If I reject, the next round will have even higher inflation for me. Alice seems to be strategic about the inflation effects.

Since the value is decreasing for me each round and Alice has only slightly improved her offer, I should accept this offer now before inflation reduces the value further.
