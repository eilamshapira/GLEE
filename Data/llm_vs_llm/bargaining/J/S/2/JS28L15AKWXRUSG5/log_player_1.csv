"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I want to maximize my potential gain, but I also need to be realistic and consider that Bob needs an incentive to accept the offer. Since this is round 1 and I don't know Bob's risk tolerance or understanding of inflation, I'll start with a slightly more generous offer to increase the likelihood of acceptance.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob's offer is a 50/50 split. Considering the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round and Bob's gain is worth 5% less, this is a reasonable offer. I'll accept to avoid further potential losses from future rounds and possible rejections.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
