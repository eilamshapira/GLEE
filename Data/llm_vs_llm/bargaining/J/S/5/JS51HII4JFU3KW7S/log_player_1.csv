"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer to divide the $1,000,000 with Bob. Since I'm facing 10% inflation per round, I need to consider that time is more costly for me.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering a slightly higher amount for myself since I face inflation costs if we delay, but also ensuring Bob gets a substantial portion to make it attractive for him to accept now rather than delay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I see that we're now in round 3, and the inflation effect means that any money I receive is worth 20% less than it would have been in round 1. I need to adjust my strategy, as continuing to reject offers will decrease the value further for me.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm offering an even 50-50 split, which is fair and should be appealing to Bob. This acknowledges that we both need to reach an agreement soon, especially given my inflation constraints."
