9999.0,1.0,"Hi Bob, I’m proposing that I receive $9999 and you get $1. I know it might look lopsided, but remember with each round you lose 5% of the money’s value while mine remain intact. Accepting this now secures you a positive payoff rather than risking further devaluation. Think it over, but I believe this is a fair offer given the inflation factor on your side.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Alice, I'm proposing a perfectly even 50-50 split that gives us both $5000. This is the fairest solution and maximizes our collective happiness. While I understand you tried to use the inflation mechanic to your advantage, such an extreme offer wasn't reasonable. This equal division respects both of us as equals in this negotiation. If you reject this offer, we both lose value - I lose 5% more, but you also lose the opportunity to secure $5000 right now.",Bob,2,

9999.0,1.0,"Hi Bob, here's my offer: I take $9999 and you get $1. I realize it might seem extremely uneven, but remember that your money’s value keeps dropping by 5% each round while mine stays constant. If you reject this offer, you’ll soon find that as the proposer you’ll be forced to offer me nearly all of the $10000 to meet my non‐discounted payoff—leaving you effectively with nothing. I’m giving you a positive payoff now, however small, which is strictly better than the inevitable outcome if we keep delaying. I hope you understand the logic and accept.",Alice,3,

5250.0,4750.0,"Alice, I'm making a revised offer that accounts for the inflation mechanics. I'll take $4750 and you get $5250, which gives you the majority of the money. This is a fair adjustment considering the inflation impact. Your repeated offers of $9999 for yourself and just $1 for me are unreasonable regardless of inflation - even with 10% inflation so far, that's not a justifiable split. If we continue this cycle, we both lose value - you from delays and missed opportunities, me from inflation. Let's reach a reasonable agreement now rather than continuing this standoff.",Bob,4,

9999.0,1.0,"Hi Bob, in this round the depreciation on your side gets even worse—each dollar you get is now worth only about 0.8145 of its face value. If you reject this offer, you'll move on to round 6 as proposer, but you'll find that because my money isn't discounted at all, any proposal you make will force you to concede nearly the whole pie to me in order to get my acceptance. In other words, your best alternative to accepting right now is effectively worth almost nothing. I'm offering you a positive immediate payoff—albeit very small—that beats your expected future outcome. I hope you'll see the logic and accept this offer.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Alice, I understand the inflation mechanics, but your offers of $1 for me remain extremely unreasonable. I'm now offering you $5500 - a clear majority that accounts for the inflation factor. If you consider the expected value of continued negotiation, this is actually favorable to you compared to dragging this out further. Your strategy of offering me essentially nothing doesn't make mathematical sense - even with inflation, a fair division would still give me thousands of dollars. If you reject this, we'll continue losing collective value as we negotiate. I'm making a genuine attempt at a reasonable compromise that recognizes the inflation impact while maintaining basic fairness.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
9900.0,100.0,"Hi Bob, here's my offer for round 7: I take $9900 and you get $100. I know this division is very uneven, but please consider the inflation mechanics at work—your dollars are now worth only about 77% (roughly) of their face value due to the 22.62% devaluation, and this gap will only widen if we delay further. If you reject now, you'll be the proposer in the next round, but the inflation will further erode the value of any amount you secure. Accepting this offer guarantees you $100 in actual dollars, which, despite the appearance, beats the steep loss you'd incur by prolonging the negotiation. I hope you recognize the economic rationale behind this proposal and agree to settle now.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"Alice, I see you've moved slightly from $1 to $100, which shows you recognize that your previous offers were unreasonable. I'm now offering you $6000 - a substantial 60% of the total that accounts for the inflation penalty I face. This is a genuine compromise that gives you a significant advantage while still being fair to me. Your claim that I must accept nearly nothing due to inflation is mathematically incorrect - even with inflation, thousands of dollars for me is still better than $100. Consider that if you continue to reject reasonable offers, we both lose value through continued negotiation. I'm making a good-faith effort to reach a fair agreement that acknowledges the asymmetric inflation impact. Let's resolve this now with a solution that respects both our interests.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
6500.0,3500.0,"Hi Bob, here’s my round 9 offer: I receive $6500 and you get $3500. I realize our earlier proposals were quite extreme, and while my previous offers heavily favored my undiminished dollars, I understand your concerns about fairness. However, please keep in mind that if we delay further, the inflation penalty on your share will worsen even more—in round 8 your dollars were already worth about 30% less than their face value, and tomorrow’s round could push that discount well beyond 30%. Accepting $3500 now secures you a higher real payoff than any future round would allow. I hope you appreciate that this is a sincere effort to compromise in light of the continuing devaluation you face, and I look forward to concluding our agreement.",Alice,9,
