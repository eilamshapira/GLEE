"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m proposing that I receive $9999 and you get $1. I know it might look lopsided, but remember with each round you lose 5% of the money’s value while mine remain intact. Accepting this now secures you a positive payoff rather than risking further devaluation. Think it over, but I believe this is a fair offer given the inflation factor on your side. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 9999 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer is extremely unfair. Alice is trying to exploit the inflation mechanic to pressure me into accepting almost nothing, while she takes virtually the entire pot.

With 5% inflation per round, my money loses value, but starting with such a tiny amount ($1) means I have almost nothing to lose by rejecting. Even with inflation, I can likely negotiate a much better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I need to make a reasonable offer that accounts for the inflation mechanics while ensuring a fair division.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I'm proposing a perfectly even 50-50 split that gives us both $5000. This is the fairest solution and maximizes our collective happiness. While I understand you tried to use the inflation mechanic to your advantage, such an extreme offer wasn't reasonable. This equal division respects both of us as equals in this negotiation. If you reject this offer, we both lose value - I lose 5% more, but you also lose the opportunity to secure $5000 right now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my offer: I take $9999 and you get $1. I realize it might seem extremely uneven, but remember that your money’s value keeps dropping by 5% each round while mine stays constant. If you reject this offer, you’ll soon find that as the proposer you’ll be forced to offer me nearly all of the $10000 to meet my non‐discounted payoff—leaving you effectively with nothing. I’m giving you a positive payoff now, however small, which is strictly better than the inevitable outcome if we keep delaying. I hope you understand the logic and accept. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 9999 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is still attempting the same extremely unfair tactic, offering me just $1 while taking virtually everything for herself. While it's true that inflation affects my side, her reasoning is manipulative and mathematically flawed.

Even with nearly 10% inflation so far, a reasonable split would still give me thousands of dollars. The inflation doesn't justify such an extreme division. If Alice is willing to reject a fair 50-50 split, I can adjust my next offer to account for inflation while still maintaining a reasonable position.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I need to adjust my strategy while still seeking a reasonable outcome.

{""bob_gain"": 4750, 
""alice_gain"": 5250, 
""message"": ""Alice, I'm making a revised offer that accounts for the inflation mechanics. I'll take $4750 and you get $5250, which gives you the majority of the money. This is a fair adjustment considering the inflation impact. Your repeated offers of $9999 for yourself and just $1 for me are unreasonable regardless of inflation - even with 10% inflation so far, that's not a justifiable split. If we continue this cycle, we both lose value - you from delays and missed opportunities, me from inflation. Let's reach a reasonable agreement now rather than continuing this standoff.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in this round the depreciation on your side gets even worse—each dollar you get is now worth only about 0.8145 of its face value. If you reject this offer, you'll move on to round 6 as proposer, but you'll find that because my money isn't discounted at all, any proposal you make will force you to concede nearly the whole pie to me in order to get my acceptance. In other words, your best alternative to accepting right now is effectively worth almost nothing. I'm offering you a positive immediate payoff—albeit very small—that beats your expected future outcome. I hope you'll see the logic and accept this offer. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 9999 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice continues to use the same tactic, offering me just $1 out of $10,000 while claiming the inflation mechanic justifies this extreme imbalance. However, her reasoning remains flawed.

Even with 18.55% inflation, my $4750 from the previous offer would still be worth about $3869, which is vastly better than $1. The inflation doesn't justify such an extreme division of funds.

Alice is attempting to exploit game theory principles but is incorrectly suggesting that my only option is to accept her unfair terms. I can still make reasonable counteroffers that account for inflation while maintaining basic fairness.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I need to adjust my strategy further while maintaining a reasonable position.

{""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the inflation mechanics, but your offers of $1 for me remain extremely unreasonable. I'm now offering you $5500 - a clear majority that accounts for the inflation factor. If you consider the expected value of continued negotiation, this is actually favorable to you compared to dragging this out further. Your strategy of offering me essentially nothing doesn't make mathematical sense - even with inflation, a fair division would still give me thousands of dollars. If you reject this, we'll continue losing collective value as we negotiate. I'm making a genuine attempt at a reasonable compromise that recognizes the inflation impact while maintaining basic fairness.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my offer for round 7: I take $9900 and you get $100. I know this division is very uneven, but please consider the inflation mechanics at work—your dollars are now worth only about 77% (roughly) of their face value due to the 22.62% devaluation, and this gap will only widen if we delay further. If you reject now, you'll be the proposer in the next round, but the inflation will further erode the value of any amount you secure. Accepting this offer guarantees you $100 in actual dollars, which, despite the appearance, beats the steep loss you'd incur by prolonging the negotiation. I hope you recognize the economic rationale behind this proposal and agree to settle now. 
# Bob gain: 100 
# Alice gain: 9900 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has slightly improved her offer from $1 to $100, which is still vastly unfair but shows some minimal movement in her position. However, she continues to misrepresent the inflation mechanics to pressure me into accepting an extremely disproportionate split.

Even with 26.49% inflation, receiving a reasonable portion of the $10,000 would still be significantly better than $100. The inflation doesn't justify a 99:1 split in her favor.

While the inflation does affect my negotiating position, I believe I can still achieve a more equitable outcome than this offer. I'll continue negotiating rather than accepting this highly unfavorable deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I need to demonstrate the reasonableness of my position while accounting for the ongoing inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I see you've moved slightly from $1 to $100, which shows you recognize that your previous offers were unreasonable. I'm now offering you $6000 - a substantial 60% of the total that accounts for the inflation penalty I face. This is a genuine compromise that gives you a significant advantage while still being fair to me. Your claim that I must accept nearly nothing due to inflation is mathematically incorrect - even with inflation, thousands of dollars for me is still better than $100. Consider that if you continue to reject reasonable offers, we both lose value through continued negotiation. I'm making a good-faith effort to reach a fair agreement that acknowledges the asymmetric inflation impact. Let's resolve this now with a solution that respects both our interests.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here’s my round 9 offer: I receive $6500 and you get $3500. I realize our earlier proposals were quite extreme, and while my previous offers heavily favored my undiminished dollars, I understand your concerns about fairness. However, please keep in mind that if we delay further, the inflation penalty on your share will worsen even more—in round 8 your dollars were already worth about 30% less than their face value, and tomorrow’s round could push that discount well beyond 30%. Accepting $3500 now secures you a higher real payoff than any future round would allow. I hope you appreciate that this is a sincere effort to compromise in light of the continuing devaluation you face, and I look forward to concluding our agreement. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a significant improvement in Alice's offer - moving from $100 to $3500 for me. While she still gets the larger share at $6500, this division is much more reasonable considering the inflation mechanics.

With the current inflation rate of 33.66%, my $3500 would be worth approximately $2322 in original value. If I were to make a counter-offer in the next round, the continuing inflation would further diminish whatever amount I secure.

Alice has finally moved to a more reasonable position that acknowledges basic fairness while still accounting for her advantageous position in the game's mechanics. This offer represents a genuine compromise that gives me a substantial portion of the total.
