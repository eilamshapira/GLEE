"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I get $90 and you get $10 out of $100. Remember, if we delay to the next round your share loses 10% of its value, so accepting now is in your best interest. Let's settle this quickly!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I think your initial offer was unfair. Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle, and I'll take $45 while you take $55. It's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort, but I'll reject your offer. Given that it's now my turn to propose in the next round—and considering that your share is devalued even further with inflation—I believe I can structure a proposal that works better for both of us. Let's continue.""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 99.99, ""bob_gain"": 0.01, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal for round 3: I take $99.99 and you get $0.01. I know it's a very lopsided split nominally, but remember that with each round your money loses 10% of its value. If you reject this offer, you'll become the proposer in round 4—but by then, your share will be worth only 70% of its nominal value, and I, as the next proposer in round 5 if needed, can secure nearly all of the $100. In effect, your best alternative to accepting now is virtually nothing. So please, save us both the delay and accept this offer.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see what you're trying to do, but I'm not giving up yet. Your extreme offer in the previous round was an attempt to intimidate me, but I'm willing to take the risk. Considering the inflation, my $40 is actually worth less, but I'm still willing to compromise. Take $60, and let's end this. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, I understand your effort. However, given the inflation penalty you'll face in subsequent rounds, I believe there's room for an even better split if we continue. I'm confident that when it's my turn to propose in round 5, I can craft a deal that offers an even greater advantage, considering your further devaluation. With that in mind, I must reject your current offer.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Bob, we've been dragging this out long enough. As you know, with every round your money loses even more of its value while mine remains intact. If you reject this offer, you'll be forced to propose in the next round—but given that I don't discount at all, you'll likely have to offer me almost the entire pie, leaving you with practically nothing. So I'm offering you $1 (which even after the 34.39% loss in value amounts to about 66 cents in today’s terms) versus the pitiful alternative. Accept this deal and let's wrap this up.""}"
