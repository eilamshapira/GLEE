"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically:

1. It's a fair 50-50 split
2. If I reject, the next round will have 5% inflation for me
3. Even if I make a better offer next round, Alice might reject it
4. A 50-50 split is generally considered fair in ultimatum games
5. The guaranteed $50 now is better than a potentially higher but uncertain amount later with inflation
