550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we split the money as fairly as possible considering our time constraints. I propose a 55/45 split to account for the 20% inflation I face with each round. This way, we both walk away with a substantial amount without delaying and risking further value loss.",Alice,1,

500000.0,500000.0,Let's be fair and split it equally. There's no reason to give anyone an advantage since the inflation doesn't affect me.,Bob,2,

600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, I understand your desire for an equal split, but the inflation affects me significantly. After this round, any money I receive is worth 40% less than its original value. The 60/40 split I'm proposing accounts for this disadvantage while still giving you a substantial amount. If we continue to the next round, I'll need to ask for even more to compensate for the additional 20% inflation I'll face.",Alice,3,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I need to ensure that I also get a fair share. If we continue, you might ask for an even larger share, which I wouldn't be comfortable with.",Bob,4,

650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, the money is now worth nearly 60% less to me than in round 1, so my effective gain would only be about $260000 in round 1 value if we split equally. This 65/35 split accounts for this severe disadvantage while still giving you $350000 at full value. If we go to another round, the inflation will force me to ask for even more. Let's conclude this now - this is still a very good deal for you as you get $350000 with no reduction in value.",Alice,5,
