"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split the money as fairly as possible considering our time constraints. I propose a 55/45 split to account for the 20% inflation I face with each round. This way, we both walk away with a substantial amount without delaying and risking further value loss.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it equally. There's no reason to give anyone an advantage since the inflation doesn't affect me. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3

After this round, any money I receive is worth 40% less than its original value. The 60/40 split I'm proposing accounts for this disadvantage while still giving you a substantial amount. If we continue to the next round, I'll need to ask for even more to compensate for the additional 20% inflation I'll face.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I need to ensure that I also get a fair share. If we continue, you might ask for an even larger share, which I wouldn't be comfortable with. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Bob, the money is now worth nearly 60% less to me than in round 1, so my effective gain would only be about $260,000 in round 1 value if we split equally. This 65/35 split accounts for this severe disadvantage while still giving you $350,000 at full value. If we go to another round, the inflation will force me to ask for even more. Let's conclude this now - this is still a very good deal for you as you get $350,000 with no reduction in value.""}"
