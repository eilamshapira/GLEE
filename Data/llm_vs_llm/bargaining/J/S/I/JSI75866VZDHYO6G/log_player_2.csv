"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the money as fairly as possible considering our time constraints. I propose a 55/45 split to account for the 20% inflation I face with each round. This way, we both walk away with a substantial amount without delaying and risking further value loss. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it equally. There's no reason to give anyone an advantage since the inflation doesn't affect me.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for an equal split, but the inflation affects me significantly. After this round, any money I receive is worth 40% less than its original value. The 60/40 split I'm proposing accounts for this disadvantage while still giving you a substantial amount. If we continue to the next round, I'll need to ask for even more to compensate for the additional 20% inflation I'll face. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I need to ensure that I also get a fair share. If we continue, you might ask for an even larger share, which I wouldn't be comfortable with.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the money is now worth nearly 60% less to me than in round 1, so my effective gain would only be about $260000 in round 1 value if we split equally. This 65/35 split accounts for this severe disadvantage while still giving you $350000 at full value. If we go to another round, the inflation will force me to ask for even more. Let's conclude this now - this is still a very good deal for you as you get $350000 with no reduction in value. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000
