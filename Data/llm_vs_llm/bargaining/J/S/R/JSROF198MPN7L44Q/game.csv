800000.0,200000.0,I believe this is a fair split considering future rounds will decrease the value for both of us. Let's settle this now!,Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I understand you want to settle quickly, but your initial offer wasn't balanced. Since your money devalues faster than mine (20% vs 5% per round), waiting hurts you more. This offer gives you a substantial $450000 while recognizing my stronger position. Let's settle now with this fair compromise.",Bob,2,
