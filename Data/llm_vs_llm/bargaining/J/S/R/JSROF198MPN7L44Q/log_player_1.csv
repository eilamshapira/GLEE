Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 800000,""bob_gain"": 200000,""message"": ""I believe this is a fair split considering future rounds will decrease the value for both of us. Let's settle this now!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to settle quickly, but your initial offer wasn't balanced. Since your money devalues faster than mine (20% vs 5% per round), waiting hurts you more. This offer gives you a substantial $450000 while recognizing my stronger position. Let's settle now with this fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
