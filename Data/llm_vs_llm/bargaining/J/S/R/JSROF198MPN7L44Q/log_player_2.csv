"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I believe this is a fair split considering future rounds will decrease the value for both of us. Let's settle this now! 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer carefully.

Alice is offering me $200,000 out of the $1,000,000, which is 20% of the total.

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but the total value will decrease by 5% for me (so the $1M becomes worth $950K to me). For Alice, it would decrease by 20% (the money becomes worth $800K to her).

Given these different inflation rates, I have a strategic advantage by rejecting early offers since Alice's money devalues faster than mine. If I reject, I can propose a more favorable split next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I need to make a strategic offer that accounts for our different inflation rates. Since Alice's money devalues faster (20% per round vs my 5%), I'll propose a more balanced split that's still favorable to me.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to settle quickly, but your initial offer wasn't balanced. Since your money devalues faster than mine (20% vs 5% per round), waiting hurts you more. This offer gives you a substantial $450,000 while recognizing my stronger position. Let's settle now with this fair compromise.""}"
