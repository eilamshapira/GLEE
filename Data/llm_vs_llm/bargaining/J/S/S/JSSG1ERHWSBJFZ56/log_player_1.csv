"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because it's reasonable enough that Bob might accept it rather than risk the 10% inflation penalty in the next round. A 55-45 split acknowledges my first-mover position while still being fair enough to hopefully secure acceptance."
