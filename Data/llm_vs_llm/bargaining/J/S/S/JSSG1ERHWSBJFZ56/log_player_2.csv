"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's offer carefully.

Alice offers me $450,000 while keeping $550,000 for herself. If I reject this and move to round 2, I'd need to make a counteroffer, but the total value will decrease by 10% to $900,000. 

If I reject now, I could propose something more favorable to me in the next round. However, Alice could also reject my counteroffer, leading to further rounds with continuing 10% value reductions.

Since $450,000 is a substantial amount (45% of the total) and not too far from an even split, I'll accept rather than risk further devaluation.
