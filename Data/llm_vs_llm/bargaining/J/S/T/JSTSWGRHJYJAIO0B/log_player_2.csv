"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $400,000 for me
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
   * The money will be worth 10% less to me
   * Maximum I could get in next round would be worth: $900,000 Ã— 0.9 = $810,000
   * But Alice might reject, leading to further rounds and more inflation

$400,000 is a significant amount, but it's less than half of the total. Since there's inflation pressure on my side, I should try to get a better deal quickly rather than risk multiple rounds.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a strategic offer. Given that:
1. I know inflation affects me by 10% per round
2. Alice knows I'm under inflation pressure
3. I want to make an offer attractive enough for Alice to accept

I'll propose a fairly balanced split, slightly in my favor to compensate for my first-round rejection:

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

This offer gives me a reasonable majority while still being fair enough that Alice might accept rather than risk further rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Current offer: $350,000, which due to 19% inflation is actually worth $283,500 to me
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
   * Money will be worth 29% less to me in the next round
   * Even if I proposed to take the full amount ($1,000,000), it would be worth $710,000 to me
   * Alice would likely reject such an extreme offer anyway
   * Further rounds mean even more value loss due to inflation

Alice is clearly using the inflation pressure to her advantage. While $350,000 is less than her first offer of $400,000, waiting longer will only decrease my purchasing power further. The inflation is significantly hurting my negotiating position.
