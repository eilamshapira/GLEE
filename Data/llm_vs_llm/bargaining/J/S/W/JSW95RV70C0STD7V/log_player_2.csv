"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair on the surface. However, there's an important asymmetry in our situation - inflation affects Alice but not me. With each round, the money becomes worth 10% less to Alice, while its value remains constant for me.

If I reject and make a counter-offer, Alice might be incentivized to accept a less favorable split in the next round, since waiting decreases the value of the money for her.

However, this is just the first round, and a 50-50 split is already quite fair. There's no guarantee Alice would accept a more favorable offer to me in later rounds, and if we reach round 12 with no agreement, we both get nothing.
