"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","For the first round, I'll make a reasonable offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob with each passing round, I'll try to be somewhat generous to encourage Bob to accept early.

Here's my offer:
{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}

This way, Bob gets a slightly larger share, which might motivate him to accept the offer and end the game early, avoiding further devaluation of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the offer from Bob, let's calculate the actual value considering the inflation:

Original amount for me: $4000
Inflation reduction for me: 5% of $4000 = $200
So, the actual value for me: $4000 - $200 = $3800

Original amount for Bob: $6000
Inflation reduction for Bob: 20% of $6000 = $1200
So, the actual value for Bob: $6000 - $1200 = $4800

Considering this, I think the offer is not in my favor, as I would get less than half of the total value. I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer was not in my favor, I'll make a new offer that's more balanced, considering the inflation.

The original $10,000 is now worth less due to inflation:
For me, it's 5% less in the second round, and now another 5% less in this round, so the total reduction is 10%.
For Bob, it's 20% less in the second round, and now another 20% less in this round, so the total reduction is 36% (1 - 0.8 * 0.8).

Let's calculate the adjusted values:
For me: $10,000 * 0.9 * 0.9 = $8,100
For Bob: $10,000 * 0.8 * 0.8 = $6,400

I'll make an offer that's closer to a 50-50 split, considering the adjusted values.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}

This way, I'm offering Bob a significant share, but still slightly less than what I'm taking, considering the inflation effects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value considering the inflation:

Original amount for me: $4500
Inflation reduction for me: 14.26% of $4500 = $643.70
So, the actual value for me: $4500 - $643.70 = $3856.30

Original amount for Bob: $5500
Inflation reduction for Bob: 48.8% of $5500 = $2684
So, the actual value for Bob: $5500 - $2684 = $2816

Considering this, I think the offer is still not in my favor, as I would get less than half of the total value. However, the inflation is reducing the value of the money significantly, so I need to consider the potential loss if I reject this offer and the game continues.

Since the difference between my share and Bob's share is not extremely large, and considering the significant inflation reduction, I'll accept this offer to avoid further losses.
