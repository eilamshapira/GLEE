"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $450,000 while she gets $550,000. While this isn't an even split, it's still a substantial amount of money. 

Given that:
1. We have 12 rounds total, but risk getting nothing if we don't agree
2. I don't face any inflation penalty (0% inflation for me)
3. I don't know how inflation affects Alice

I could reject and propose a more favorable split next round, but there's also value in reaching an agreement early without risking further negotiations.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more even split while still being reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I'm offering a perfectly even 50/50 split of the million dollars, which I believe is fair to both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice has improved her offer, giving me $480,000 instead of the initial $450,000. I also learned that Alice is affected by inflation (19% so far), which explains why she might be more eager to reach an agreement sooner rather than later.

Since I don't face any inflation penalty, I could potentially reject and try to get an even better deal in the next round. However, if Alice is facing significant inflation, she may become more desperate in later rounds, but also potentially more stubborn if she feels she's already compromised.

Given that her offer has improved and is now closer to an even split, and considering the risk of getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds:
