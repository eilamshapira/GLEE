"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 525000 
# Alice gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me evaluate Alice's offer.

She's offering me $525,000 out of the $1,000,000, which is 52.5% of the total. This is slightly more than half, which seems fair on the surface.

However, I need to consider the inflation effect. If I reject, we go to the next round where I can make a counter-offer, but the money will be worth 10% less to me. That means in the next round, the $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $900,000 to me.

If I make a counter-offer in the next round and Alice rejects it, we'd go to round 3 where the money would be worth even less to me.

The current offer gives me $525,000, which is better than what I might end up with after inflation in future rounds, especially if negotiations drag on.
