"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since Bob can always counter-offer.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I want to keep the negotiations friendly while acknowledging the time pressure from inflation. If Bob rejects, each subsequent round will be worth less to me, so I'm starting with a reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. The offer is a 50-50 split
2. Due to inflation, my $50 is actually worth $47.50 to me (95% of $50)
3. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount will be worth even less due to continued inflation
4. We still have 10 rounds left, but continuing to negotiate means losing value
5. This is a fair offer and the loss from inflation isn't severe enough yet to reject it
