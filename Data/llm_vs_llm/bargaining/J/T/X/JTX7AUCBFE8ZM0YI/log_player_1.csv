"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Bob, let's split it 60/40. This is a fair offer and inflation is eating away at our potential gains. Let's take the sure thing.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's split it evenly. 50/50 is the fairest way to ensure both of us benefit.  We can avoid further rounds and the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
