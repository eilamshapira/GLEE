"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it equally. It's fair and simple. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice proposes a 50-50 split ($5,000 each)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, in the next round the money will be worth less to me
4. $5,000 now is better than potentially getting more in the next round but losing 5% value
5. This is a fair and reasonable offer
