"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's keep this simple: a perfectly even split. No need to speculate about who might be affected by inflation more. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
