"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a fair offer from Alice, proposing an equal split of the money. However, I need to consider the inflation effect. If I reject, the money will be worth 20% less for me in the next round. So even if I could potentially get more in a future round, I'd need to get substantially more to offset the inflation.

Given that there's a 20% inflation penalty for me per round, and I don't know Alice's inflation rate, accepting a fair split now seems prudent.
