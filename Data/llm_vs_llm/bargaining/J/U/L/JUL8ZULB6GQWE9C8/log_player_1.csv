"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to avoid inflation reducing the total value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the amount equally at 50-50 to ensure we both benefit equally before inflation takes more value away from us. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
* If I accept now, I'll get $50 with 5% inflation = $47.50 effective value
* If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount I get will be worth 10% less
* Even if I managed to get $60 in the next round, it would be worth $54 after 10% inflation
* The current offer of $47.50 effective value is better than risking further rounds
* Bob's offer is reasonable and fair
