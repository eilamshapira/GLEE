Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, inflation is eating away at our money. Let's split it more fairly. I'll take 55, you take 45. This is a good deal for both of us.

# Bob gain: 55
