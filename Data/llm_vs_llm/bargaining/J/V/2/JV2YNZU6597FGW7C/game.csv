26.49,73.51,"Hi Bob – here’s my proposal for Round 1. I suggest that you get $73.51 and I keep $26.49. Given that as the rounds progress your dollars lose 5% of their value while mine don’t decay at all, this split is calibrated to be as fair as possible if we were to continue bargaining. Accepting now secures you $73.51 at full current value—better than waiting and seeing the competitive offers in later rounds. I look forward to your reply!",Alice,1,

50.0,50.0,"Hi Alice, I rejected your previous offer because I believe we can find a more mutually beneficial split. Given the depreciation of my potential earnings, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. My offer of $50-$50 is a fair starting point, considering we've just begun negotiating. Accepting this offer ensures you get a significant share without risking further depreciation of the total value. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",Bob,2,

47.0,53.0,"Hi Bob – in Round 3, I’m proposing that I get $47 and you get $53 of the $100. Given that your dollars now have a 10% depreciation (making your $53 effectively worth about $47.70) while my share remains undiminished, this deal roughly balances the effective payoffs between us. By accepting now you avoid further depreciation in future rounds, and you lock in nearly equal effective value. I hope we can settle the matter quickly and fairly. What do you think?",Alice,3,
