"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob – here’s my proposal for Round 1. I suggest that you get $73.51 and I keep $26.49. Given that as the rounds progress your dollars lose 5% of their value while mine don’t decay at all, this split is calibrated to be as fair as possible if we were to continue bargaining. Accepting now secures you $73.51 at full current value—better than waiting and seeing the competitive offers in later rounds. I look forward to your reply! 
# Bob gain: 73.51 
# Alice gain: 26.49 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether I should accept this offer, let's analyze the situation. 

In the first round, the total amount of money is $100, and its value to me is also $100. Alice's offer gives me $73.51 and her $26.49. 

Considering the 5% decrease in value for me in each subsequent round, if I reject this offer, the total amount of money will be worth 95% of its current value to me in the next round, which is $95. However, this doesn't directly affect my decision in this round since the value decrease happens after each round.

Given that Alice's offer is quite generous, with me receiving approximately 73.51% of the total amount, it seems like a reasonable starting point. However, I should also consider the strategic aspect of the game and the fact that Alice's money does not depreciate.

For now, I will reject the offer to see if I can get a better deal in the next round, considering that the depreciation of my potential earnings might put pressure on Alice to make a more favorable offer to me in subsequent rounds.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Now it's my turn to make an offer. 

Considering the game's dynamics and the fact that my money depreciates by 5% each round, I want to make an offer that is reasonable but also takes into account the potential future depreciation of my share.

For Round 2, I propose that I receive $50 and Alice receives $50. This split is fair, given that we are at the beginning of the game and both players have an equal chance of negotiating.

However, I want to attach a message to persuade Alice to accept this offer:

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I rejected your previous offer because I believe we can find a more mutually beneficial split. Given the depreciation of my potential earnings, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. My offer of $50-$50 is a fair starting point, considering we've just begun negotiating. Accepting this offer ensures you get a significant share without risking further depreciation of the total value. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob – in Round 3, I’m proposing that I get $47 and you get $53 of the $100. Given that your dollars now have a 10% depreciation (making your $53 effectively worth about $47.70) while my share remains undiminished, this deal roughly balances the effective payoffs between us. By accepting now you avoid further depreciation in future rounds, and you lock in nearly equal effective value. I hope we can settle the matter quickly and fairly. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 53 
# Alice gain: 47 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze the situation.

In Round 3, due to the 5% depreciation in each of the two previous rounds (5% in Round 1 and another 5% in Round 2, but applied only once as we are in Round 3, so 5% + 5% = 10% total depreciation, but since it is compounded it is 5% * 5% = 9.75% less), the $53 I would receive is indeed worth approximately $53 * 0.9075 = $48.07 to me, considering the depreciation.

Alice's offer seems reasonable, as it takes into account the depreciation of my share. The effective values are roughly balanced, with me getting approximately $48.07 and Alice getting $47.

However, I should also consider the strategic aspect of the game. If I reject this offer, the depreciation will continue, and my potential earnings will decrease further. On the other hand, Alice's share remains unaffected by the depreciation.

Given the current situation and the fact that Alice's offer is relatively fair, I will accept this offer to avoid further depreciation and lock in a reasonable effective value.
