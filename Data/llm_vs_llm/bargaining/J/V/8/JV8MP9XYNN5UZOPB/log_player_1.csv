"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair offer to start, considering the inflation effect on my side.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose we split the money equally, $50 each. This is a fair division that benefits us both equally."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I see that we have different perspectives. Let me make a more balanced offer considering the inflation effect.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm offering you $45 while I take $55. Since the money is worth less to me each round due to inflation (already 20% less value for me by now), this slightly higher amount helps offset my loss in value while still giving you a substantial portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
