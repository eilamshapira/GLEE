55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a slightly higher share for me at 55% because with each round, the money is worth 10% less to me, while it doesn't lose value for you. This is a fair split considering that delay hurts me more than you.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"Since the money loses value for you with each round, I'm making a serious offer. If you accept now, we can both get a good share, but if you decline, I'll have to reconsider my next offer, keeping in mind the decreasing value for you.",Bob,2,

51.0,49.0,"Bob, I've reduced my request from 55 to 51 dollars, which is very reasonable considering inflation is hurting only me. At this point, my 51 dollars is only worth about 46 dollars of original value to me. If we delay further, we both lose out - you'll get less total and I'll suffer more from inflation. This is a fair compromise.",Alice,3,

35.0,65.0,"Considering the significant impact of inflation on your share, I'm surprised you didn't accept my previous offer. Since the value of your potential gain continues to drop, I'm adjusting my offer to reflect the current situation. If you don't accept this, the next round might not be as favorable for you.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
48.0,52.0,"Bob, I'm making a final reasonable offer. With 30% inflation affecting me now, my $48 is actually worth only about $34 in original value. If we go another round, even if I were to get $45, it would be worth less than $30 to me due to inflation. This offer gives you the majority while still leaving me with something meaningful. Any further delay significantly hurts both of us - you'll end up with less total and I'll suffer severe inflation losses.",Alice,5,
