500000.0,500000.0,"I'm proposing an equal 50-50 split which is fair to both of us. I rejected your initial offer because it was heavily weighted in your favor. This equal division respects both our interests. Keep in mind that if you reject this, we'll both face inflation losses in the next round, so this is the most efficient outcome for both of us.",Bob,2,
