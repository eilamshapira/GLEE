Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing an equal 50-50 split which is fair to both of us. I rejected your initial offer because it was heavily weighted in your favor. This equal division respects both our interests. Keep in mind that if you reject this, we'll both face inflation losses in the next round, so this is the most efficient outcome for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
