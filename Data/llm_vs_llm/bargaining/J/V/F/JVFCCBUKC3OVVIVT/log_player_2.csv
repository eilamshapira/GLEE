"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split with 90% for me and 10% for you. I believe this is a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer would give me only 10% ($100,000) of the total amount, which isn't very favorable for me, especially considering inflation will reduce the value in future rounds.

However, if I reject, we move to the next round where I can make a counter-offer, but the total value will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation. This means the $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $950,000 to me in the next round.

Given that I can make a more equitable counter-proposal in the next round despite the 5% inflation, and that the current offer is quite unfavorable, I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer that acknowledges both our interests while considering the inflation factor.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""I'm proposing an equal 50-50 split which is fair to both of us. I rejected your initial offer because it was heavily weighted in your favor. This equal division respects both our interests. Keep in mind that if you reject this, we'll both face inflation losses in the next round, so this is the most efficient outcome for both of us.""}"
