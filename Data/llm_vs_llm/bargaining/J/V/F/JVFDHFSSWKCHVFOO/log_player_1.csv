"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to make an offer that Bob is likely to accept, keeping in mind the inflation that affects me each round. Since this is the first round, I'll start with a relatively generous offer to increase the chances of acceptance.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I see Bob is being somewhat reasonable, increasing his share slightly. Considering the inflation affecting me, and that there are still many rounds to go, I will accept his offer.

""decision"": ""accept""
