"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer that accounts for the inflation I'll face in future rounds while trying to be fair to both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering you slightly more than half because I face a 10% inflation penalty for each round that passes. This is a fair split that gives us both a significant portion while acknowledging the time pressure I'm under."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to be strategic here, considering the inflation effect on my share.

{""alice_gain"": 5300, ""bob_gain"": 4700}

I'm adjusting my offer slightly to be more favorable to Bob than my initial proposal, while still accounting for the inflation penalty I face. With each round, the money becomes worth less to me, so I'm hoping we can reach an agreement quickly. This is a reasonable compromise that gives us both a substantial portion."
