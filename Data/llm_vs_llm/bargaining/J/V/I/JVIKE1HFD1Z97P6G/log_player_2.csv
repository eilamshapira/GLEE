"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split it close to evenly. This way, we both get a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer gives me $45 and her $55. If I reject and propose in the next round, the total value will decrease by 5% due to inflation (on my side), meaning the $100 would effectively be worth $95 to me. 

If I make a counter-offer in the next round, I could potentially get more than $45, but I need to consider that:
1. I'm already getting a substantial portion (45%)
2. Inflation will reduce the value for me in the next round
3. Alice may reject my counter-offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation

Given that $45 now is likely better than potentially more money later with inflation, I'll accept this offer.
