"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
- Alice is offering me $40 while keeping $60 for herself
- If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
- However, due to 10% inflation, any amount I get next round will be worth 10% less to me
- If I get $50 next round, it would only be worth $45 to me
- $40 now is better than $45 worth of inflated money next round
