440000.0,560000.0,"Alice, I appreciate your push for fairness. However, with round 2 upon us, every delay costs me 10% in value. To ensure we both walk away without further losses, I'm proposing a deal that slightly favors me nominally. Let's settle now before more of the pie loses value.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, I understand your concern about the value loss, but a 44-56 split is too uneven considering my higher inflation rate. Let's find a more balanced solution in the next round.",Alice,2,reject
480000.0,520000.0,"Bob, considering our different inflation rates, I propose a 48-52 split. This way, we both get a fair share adjusted for our losses. Let's end this before it gets worse.",Alice,3,
