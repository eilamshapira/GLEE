Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your push for fairness. However, with round 2 upon us, every delay costs me 10% in value. To ensure we both walk away without further losses, I'm proposing a deal that slightly favors me nominally. Let's settle now before more of the pie loses value. 
# Alice gain: 440000 
# Bob gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
