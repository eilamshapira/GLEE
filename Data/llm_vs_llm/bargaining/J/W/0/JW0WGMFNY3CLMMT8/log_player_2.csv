However, with round 2 upon us, every delay costs me 10% in value. To ensure we both walk away without further losses, I'm proposing a deal that slightly favors me nominally. Let's settle now before more of the pie loses value.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering our different inflation rates, I propose a 48-52 split. This way, we both get a fair share adjusted for our losses. Let's end this before it gets worse. 
# Bob gain: 520000 
# Alice gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
