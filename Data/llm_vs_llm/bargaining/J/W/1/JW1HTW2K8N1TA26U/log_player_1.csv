"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to factor in the inflation for me, but not necessarily for Bob. I'll start with a relatively generous offer to try and secure a deal early.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob rejected my generous offer and is now offering me significantly less. I need to consider the inflation and how many rounds we have left. Accepting this offer would give me $40, which is worth $40 * 0.8 = $32 of the original value.

I think I can do better. I'll reject and make a counteroffer next round.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, it's my turn again. My money is now worth 40% less than the original value (0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64). I need to balance getting a decent amount with making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept. I will propose a slightly better offer for me than Bob's last offer, accounting for the decreased value of the money for me.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
