"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split it fairly! I'll take 6000 and you get 4000. Fair enough? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $4000 out of $10000
2. If I reject, we go to next round where:
   - I can make an offer
   - But my money will be worth 20% less
   - $4000 now > $5000 in next round (after 20% inflation)
3. The split (40%-60%) isn't perfectly equal, but it's reasonable
4. Getting something now is better than risking more rounds of inflation
