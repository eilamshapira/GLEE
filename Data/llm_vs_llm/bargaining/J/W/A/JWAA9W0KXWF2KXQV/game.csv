1000000.0,0.0,"Bob, consider this: if you reject my offer, you'll make the proposal next round—but because your money is devalued by 5% per round and I remain fully patient, your bargaining power effectively vanishes. In equilibrium, you’d end up with nothing anyway. So why delay? Accept this offer now and we both finalize the deal!",Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because while you have time advantage, I'm making an immediate offer that gives you substantial value ($400000) without any risk or delay. If you reject, we'll lose more rounds to negotiation, and the total value will decrease due to my devaluation, leaving less for both of us. This is a win-win proposal.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, your offer gives me only $400000 while I know that by taking the proposer’s role in the next round—and considering your money’s ongoing 5% devaluation—I can secure a better outcome for myself. I’m rejecting your proposal.",Alice,2,reject
55556.0,944444.0,"Bob, if you reject this offer, you'll become the proposer in round 4, but by then your share will be hit by an extra round of devaluation—leaving you with an effective payoff of roughly $850000. Accepting now gives you 0.90 × $944444 ≈ $850000 in real value. There's no benefit in waiting, so please accept this fair, conclusive proposal.",Alice,3,
