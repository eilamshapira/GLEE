"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 1000000, ""bob_gain"": 0, ""message"": ""Bob, consider this: if you reject my offer, you'll make the proposal next round—but because your money is devalued by 5% per round and I remain fully patient, your bargaining power effectively vanishes. In equilibrium, you’d end up with nothing anyway. So why delay? Accept this offer now and we both finalize the deal!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because while you have time advantage, I'm making an immediate offer that gives you substantial value ($400000) without any risk or delay. If you reject, we'll lose more rounds to negotiation, and the total value will decrease due to my devaluation, leaving less for both of us. This is a win-win proposal. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, your offer gives me only $400,000 while I know that by taking the proposer’s role in the next round—and considering your money’s ongoing 5% devaluation—I can secure a better outcome for myself. I’m rejecting your proposal.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55556, ""bob_gain"": 944444, ""message"": ""Bob, if you reject this offer, you'll become the proposer in round 4, but by then your share will be hit by an extra round of devaluation—leaving you with an effective payoff of roughly $850,000. Accepting now gives you 0.90 × $944,444 ≈ $850,000 in real value. There's no benefit in waiting, so please accept this fair, conclusive proposal.""}"
