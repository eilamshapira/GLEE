"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, consider this: if you reject my offer, you'll make the proposal next round—but because your money is devalued by 5% per round and I remain fully patient, your bargaining power effectively vanishes. In equilibrium, you’d end up with nothing anyway. So why delay? Accept this offer now and we both finalize the deal! 
# Bob gain: 0 
# Alice gain: 1000000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think this through:

1. Alice is offering me $0, keeping the full $1,000,000 for herself.
2. While she makes a strategic argument about my declining bargaining power due to the 5% devaluation per round, accepting $0 is the worst possible outcome for me.
3. Even with a 5% devaluation, making a counter-offer in the next round would give me a chance to get some value.
4. The 5% devaluation means that in the next round, the money will be worth 95% of its current value to me, which is still far better than $0.
5. I can make a more reasonable offer in the next round that takes into account both our positions.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a strategic offer that accounts for both the devaluation effect and the need for a mutually acceptable solution:

{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because while you have time advantage, I'm making an immediate offer that gives you substantial value ($400,000) without any risk or delay. If you reject, we'll lose more rounds to negotiation, and the total value will decrease due to my devaluation, leaving less for both of us. This is a win-win proposal.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, if you reject this offer, you'll become the proposer in round 4, but by then your share will be hit by an extra round of devaluation—leaving you with an effective payoff of roughly $850000. Accepting now gives you 0.90 × $944444 ≈ $850000 in real value. There's no benefit in waiting, so please accept this fair, conclusive proposal. 
# Bob gain: 944444 
# Alice gain: 55556 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $944,444, which due to the 9.75% devaluation is worth about $852,861 to me.
2. Her argument about future devaluation is valid - if I reject, my next proposal would be subject to another 5% devaluation.
3. This is actually a very reasonable offer that gives me the majority of the money.
4. The additional devaluation in the next round would indeed reduce my effective bargaining power further.
5. This offer is substantially better than her first offer and gives me a good real value.

Given that:
- The offer gives me a significant portion of the money
- Further delays would only reduce the real value of my share
- The math in her argument is sound
- This is a substantial improvement from previous offers
