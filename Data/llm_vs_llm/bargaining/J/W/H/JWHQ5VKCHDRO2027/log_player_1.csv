"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer that is fair and takes into account the 10% inflation penalty I face with each round.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose a 55/45 split slightly in my favor since I face a 10% inflation penalty if we need to go to additional rounds. This is a fair starting offer that gives Bob a substantial portion while recognizing the time pressure I'm under."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I see that Bob is also facing inflation, even higher than mine. This gives me more information to make a better offer.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose an equal 50/50 split. This is a fair division that acknowledges both of us are facing inflation penalties - I'm now at 20% inflation and Bob is at 30% inflation. An even split represents a reasonable compromise that should be acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","I notice Bob continues to offer himself more despite facing increasingly severe inflation. Let me try a more strategic approach.

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}

I propose a 45/55 split in Bob's favor. We're now in round 5, where my inflation is about 34.4% and Bob's is around 59%. Bob seems to want a larger share, and I'm willing to concede more to reach an agreement since further delays hurt us both significantly. This offer gives Bob the majority while still ensuring I receive a reasonable portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","I see that Bob continues to seek a larger share despite the increasing inflation penalties. Given we're now in round 7 with significant inflation for both of us (I'm at ~47% inflation and Bob is at ~74%), I need to be more accommodating to reach an agreement.

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60}

I propose a 40/60 split in Bob's favor. This gives Bob a substantial majority while still providing me with a reasonable portion. The rapidly increasing inflation makes reaching an agreement urgent for both of us, and this offer recognizes Bob's apparent preference for a larger share while remaining acceptable for me."
