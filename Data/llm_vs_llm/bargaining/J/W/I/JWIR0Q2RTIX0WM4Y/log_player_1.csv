"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. I believe this is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob is offering me $40 while he keeps $60, and the value of his $60 is reduced by 20% compared to round 1. I need to consider if this is a better deal than potentially getting even less later.

Let's think. If I reject, inflation continues to affect Bob, but there's also a risk he'll be more greedy in the next round.

Given the circumstances, I'll accept.
