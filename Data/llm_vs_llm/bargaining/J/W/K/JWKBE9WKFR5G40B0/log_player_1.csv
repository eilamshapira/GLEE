"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it 50-50. This way we both benefit equally, and we can avoid losing value to inflation in further rounds. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
