"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. I'm being offered $40 out of $100
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 10% inflation, the money will be worth less to me next round
4. $40 now is better than $44.44 next round (because $44.44 after 10% inflation is worth $40)

While the split isn't entirely equal, getting $40 now is reasonable considering the inflation penalty for waiting. If I reject and try to negotiate for more, the inflation will eat into my gains.
