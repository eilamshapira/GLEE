"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a slightly favorable split for myself since I'm making the first offer, but still fair enough that Bob might accept to avoid inflation effects.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. With 5% inflation for me, if I accept Bob's offer of $60, it's actually worth $57 to me (60 * 0.95). This is better than my initial offer where I proposed getting $55.
