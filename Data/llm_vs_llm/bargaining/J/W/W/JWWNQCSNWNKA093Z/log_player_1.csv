Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe a 50-50 split would be more fair. This way we both get an equal share, and we can conclude the deal quickly without risking further rounds. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
