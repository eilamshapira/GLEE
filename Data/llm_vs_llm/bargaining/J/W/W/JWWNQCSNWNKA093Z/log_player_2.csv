"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split it close to evenly. This way, we both get a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
1. She's proposing a 40-60 split, giving me $400,000 and herself $600,000
2. While it's not a 50-50 split, it's still a substantial amount of money
3. However, since this is the first round and there are 11 more possible rounds, I could try to negotiate for a better deal
4. Since inflation doesn't affect my value, I don't lose anything by continuing to negotiate

I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while maintaining a constructive tone:

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but I believe a 50-50 split would be more fair. This way we both get an equal share, and we can conclude the deal quickly without risking further rounds.""}"
