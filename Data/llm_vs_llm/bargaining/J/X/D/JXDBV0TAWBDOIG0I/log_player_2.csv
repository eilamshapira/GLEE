"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  We can adjust in the next round if you think it's unfair. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. With each round, the money loses 5% of its value for me and 10% for Alice. 

If I accept now:
- I get $45

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
- The total value is reduced by inflation
- For me: $100 × 0.95 = $95 total value
- For Alice: $100 × 0.9 = $90 total value

Since Alice is facing higher inflation, I have some negotiating leverage in the next round. However, a 55/45 split is already fairly reasonable, and the certainty of $45 now might be better than risking further negotiation.

After considering the inflation factors, I'll make my decision.
