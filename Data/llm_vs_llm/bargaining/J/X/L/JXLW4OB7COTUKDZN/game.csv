6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, let's start with a fair split. I propose I get 6000 and you get 4000. This gives you a solid start, and we avoid losing value due to inflation. What do you say?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Let's aim for a more balanced split. My proposal gives us both a significant amount, considering the inflation factor. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiations.",Bob,2,

5200.0,4800.0,"Okay Bob, let's meet in the middle. I propose I get 5200 and you get 4800. This is only slightly more than my initial proposal, and I think it's a fair compromise given the inflation. Let's lock this in.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Given the increasing inflation, I think a 50/50 split is the most reasonable proposal at this point. It ensures we both get a fair share of the remaining value.",Bob,4,
