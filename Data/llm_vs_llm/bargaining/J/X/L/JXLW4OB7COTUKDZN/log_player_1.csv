"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Okay, I understand the game. It's important to consider the diminishing value of the money for both of us with each round. I'll start with a generous offer to increase the likelihood of acceptance, especially since it's the first round.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's start with a fair split. I propose I get 6000 and you get 4000. This gives you a solid start, and we avoid losing value due to inflation. What do you say?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's aim for a more balanced split. My proposal gives us both a significant amount, considering the inflation factor. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob's offer is 4500 for me and 5500 for him. I need to consider the inflation. For me, the value of the money is 10% less than in round 1. For Bob, it's 20% less.

If I accept, I get 4500 now. If I reject, I need to consider what I think I can get in future rounds, keeping in mind the increasing inflation. Bob's offer isn't *terrible*, but I think I can do better. I'll reject and try to get closer to 5000, while acknowledging that inflation is eating away at the value.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Alright, it's my turn to make an offer again. I need to balance getting a reasonable amount now with the increasing inflation. Since Bob started with offering me 4500, I'll aim a little higher, but not too greedy, to increase the chances of acceptance. My money is now worth 20% less than in round 1, and Bob's is worth 40% less.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""Okay Bob, let's meet in the middle. I propose I get 5200 and you get 4800. This is only slightly more than my initial proposal, and I think it's a fair compromise given the inflation. Let's lock this in.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the increasing inflation, I think a 50/50 split is the most reasonable proposal at this point. It ensures we both get a fair share of the remaining value. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob's offering a 50/50 split. Let's analyze:

*   **My Inflation:** 27.1% less than round 1.
*   **Bob's Inflation:** 48.8% less than round 1.

A 50/50 split sounds fair *on the surface*, but I need to consider the difference in inflation's impact. Bob is losing value much faster. However, I am losing value too, and if we keep playing, my potential gains will keep shrinking fast.

Given the round, the fact that he's offering 5000, and my inflation penalty of 27.1%, I think this is the best I'm likely to get. It's time to accept.
