"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with an equal split, 50-50. It's fair and we both benefit equally before inflation affects us. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Let's wait for a better offer in the next round, considering the inflation effect on Alice's value of money. I'll make a proposal that benefits us both while acknowledging the asymmetrical inflation rates."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation rate is higher on your side, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This way, we both get a fair share considering the devaluation of money.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given the higher inflation rate on my side, I'm proposing a 48-52 split in your favor. This is a compromise from my initial 50-50 offer, acknowledging the devaluation but still aiming for a near-equal share. 
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

A 52-48 split in my favor is reasonable, considering the inflation rates. It's better to secure this amount rather than risking further devaluation in the following rounds. Let's accept Alice's offer and end the game."
