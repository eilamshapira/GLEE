"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. The offer is a 50-50 split, which is fair
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 5% less in the next round
3. Even if I make a more favorable proposal next round, Alice might reject it
4. A fair split now is better than risking further negotiations with inflation
