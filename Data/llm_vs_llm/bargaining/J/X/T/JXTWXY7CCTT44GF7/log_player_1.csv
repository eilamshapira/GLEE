"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you can still make a good profit.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation affecting my share, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This way, we both still get a reasonable amount, and it accounts for the decreasing value of the money for me. Let's reach an agreement soon! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Bob is offering me $45, which due to 5% inflation is worth $42.75 to me now
2. Rejecting means we move to next round where I can make an offer, but money will be worth even less (10% less than original for me)
3. There's a risk of going through many rounds and losing significant value
4. Bob's offer is reasonable considering the inflation effects
