``` 

I need to hold firm a little longer. While the value is decreasing, accepting an unfair deal this early sets a bad precedent and Bob is unlikely to offer anything better until I'm in a much worse position."

This is getting tight, but I have to hold a little longer. Accepting now would be a significant loss. Bob is clearly using delaying tactics to his advantage."

This is getting very risky, but I have to hold out a bit longer. Accepting this offer would be a huge loss, and I think Bob might be bluffing about not going lower."

This is incredibly frustrating, but I have to accept. With the inflation, it's only going to get worse from here, and I'll risk getting nothing at all if I continue to refuse."
