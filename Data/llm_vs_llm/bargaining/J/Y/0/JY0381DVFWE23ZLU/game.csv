50.0,50.0,"I appreciate your offer, but I think an equal 50-50 split would be more fair for both of us. This gives us both a reasonable amount without having to suffer through inflation in future rounds. With my higher inflation rate (20% vs your 5%), it makes sense to resolve this quickly with an equal division.",Bob,2,
