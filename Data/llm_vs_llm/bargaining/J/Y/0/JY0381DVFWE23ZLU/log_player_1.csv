"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think an equal 50-50 split would be more fair for both of us. This gives us both a reasonable amount without having to suffer through inflation in future rounds. With my higher inflation rate (20% vs your 5%), it makes sense to resolve this quickly with an equal division. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
