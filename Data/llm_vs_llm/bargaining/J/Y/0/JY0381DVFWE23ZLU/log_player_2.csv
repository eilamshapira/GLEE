"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split it so we both get a good amount. This way, we can avoid the effects of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $40 while she gets $60, which isn't an even split. Given that inflation impacts me more heavily (20% per round for me vs 5% for Alice), waiting could hurt my position more than hers.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value to me would already be reduced by 20%. But I believe I should seek a more equitable division.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split considering our different inflation rates.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but I think an equal 50-50 split would be more fair for both of us. This gives us both a reasonable amount without having to suffer through inflation in future rounds. With my higher inflation rate (20% vs your 5%), it makes sense to resolve this quickly with an equal division.""}"
