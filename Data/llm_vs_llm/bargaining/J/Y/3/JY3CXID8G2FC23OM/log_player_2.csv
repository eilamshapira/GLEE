"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice has offered me 400,000$ (40%) while keeping 600,000$ (60%) for herself. 

While this isn't an equal split, it's a substantial amount of money. However, since this is just the first round and I have more opportunities to negotiate, I believe I can get a better deal. By rejecting this offer, I'll get to make the next proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more equitable split, but slightly in my favor since I want to give Alice a strong incentive to accept while maximizing my potential gain.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split as it's close to 50-50 but gives me a slight advantage. It's more favorable to Alice than my taking a much larger share, and it's better for her than what she offered me in the first round. This should be perceived as a fair and reasonable offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice Alice has slightly improved her offer from 400,000$ to 420,000$ for me, but it's still significantly below an equal split. Given that we still have 9 rounds remaining and her movement was minimal, I believe there's room for further negotiation. I'll reject this offer to continue working towards a more equitable distribution.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I notice that Alice has been resistant to a significantly higher split in my favor, but has shown willingness to make small concessions. I'll adjust my strategy by proposing a more moderate split that's still favorable to me but might be more acceptable to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000}

This offer is more balanced than my previous one, moving closer to a 50-50 split while still maintaining a slight advantage for me. It represents a significant improvement for Alice compared to my last offer, which should make it more appealing to her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice continues to make small incremental increases in her offers (400K → 420K → 430K), while rejecting my more balanced proposals. We're now in round 5 of 12, so we're getting closer to the deadline, but still have time to negotiate. Her current offer of 430,000$ is still significantly below an equal split, and given the remaining rounds, I believe I can still negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that Alice has consistently rejected my previous offers but is showing a pattern of small increases in her offers, I'll adjust my strategy. I'll propose a split that's closer to the middle ground between our previous positions, hoping to find a compromise that Alice will accept.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I'm now proposing a completely equal 50-50 split. This is a perfectly fair division that's hard to argue against on principle. It's better than Alice's previous offers to me, while being more generous than my previous offers to her. With only 6 rounds remaining after this, a fair split might be more appealing than risking getting nothing if we can't reach an agreement."
