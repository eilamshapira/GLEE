"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer to divide the $100, considering the inflation rates for both of us.

Given that inflation impacts me more heavily (20% per round) than Bob (5% per round), I should be strategic in my first offer. I want to make an offer that's fair enough that Bob might accept, while still being good for me.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm offering a slightly higher portion for myself but still giving Bob a substantial amount. If we move to additional rounds, the total value decreases for both of us, but especially for me due to the higher inflation rate."
