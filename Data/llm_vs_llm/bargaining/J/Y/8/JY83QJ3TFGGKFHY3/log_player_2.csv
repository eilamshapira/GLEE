"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, a slight edge for me to secure a quick agreement. Time is money!

# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concern about inflation, but my previous offer was reasonable. This offer is slightly better for me, but still very fair. Let's take it and avoid further losses! 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is sticking very close to her original offer, even though the value of the money is decreasing. This indicates she may be willing to concede a bit more as the rounds progress and the pressure of inflation mounts."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 540000,
""alice_gain"": 460000,
""message"": ""Alice, time is literally money here. I'm offering a good deal, but we need to act fast before inflation erodes its value further.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking to my guns with a slightly favorable split, but emphasizing the time pressure.  Alice needs to understand that every rejected offer hurts us both."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, inflation is hurting us both. Let's be sensible. I'm moving slightly closer to your previous offer, but I still need a bit more to make it worthwhile. This is a fair compromise given the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 470000 
# Alice gain: 530000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving in the right direction, but very slowly.  It seems like she's aiming to reach an agreement closer to the middle by Round 12. I need to show her that I'm willing to wait for a better offer.  The pressure of inflation is working in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 530000,
""alice_gain"": 470000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm holding firm at this split. It's a fair deal considering the time pressure we're both under. Let's be pragmatic and secure our shares before they shrink any further.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm mirroring Alice's tactic from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise but standing firm on a favorable split.  This maintains pressure on her to make a substantial move soon."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time, and inflation is really biting. I'm willing to concede more to reach an agreement. I think this is a very fair split now, almost 50/50. Let's lock this in before we both lose out completely. 
# Bob gain: 510000 
# Alice gain: 490000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has finally crossed the 50/50 threshold and offered a deal that favors me, even if only slightly. While I might be able to push for a tiny bit more in the remaining rounds, the risk of losing everything to inflation is too high. This is a good deal considering the circumstances, and it's time to secure the win."
