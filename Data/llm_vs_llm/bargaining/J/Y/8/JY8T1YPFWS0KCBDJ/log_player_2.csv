"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer gives me $400,000 and Alice $600,000
2. If I reject, the value will decrease by 5% in the next round for me
3. Starting value: $400,000
4. Next round value: $380,000
5. I could counter-offer in the next round, but Alice might reject
6. We only have 12 rounds total, and each delay costs me money
7. While not a 50-50 split, $400,000 is still a significant amount

Although it's not an equal split, accepting $400,000 now is better than risking getting less in future rounds due to the 5% depreciation. It's a reasonable first offer.
