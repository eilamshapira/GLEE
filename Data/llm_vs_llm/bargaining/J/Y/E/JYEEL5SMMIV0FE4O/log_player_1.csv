"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a reasonable offer, considering that with each round, my share loses 5% value due to inflation. I want to secure a good deal while being fair enough that Bob might accept.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because:
1. It gives me a slight advantage (55%) while still being reasonably fair to Bob (45%)
2. If Bob rejects, my next potential gain will be worth less due to inflation
3. It's not so uneven that it would likely trigger an automatic rejection"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Due to inflation, if I accept now, my $500,000 is actually worth $475,000 (95% of original value)
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount I get will be worth only 90% of the original value
3. Bob's offering a perfectly equal split, which is quite fair
4. There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in future rounds, and the value will keep decreasing
5. We still have 10 rounds left, but each round makes my potential gains worth less

Given these factors, I'll accept this offer. A guaranteed $475,000 (in effective value) is better than risking further depreciation of my share.
