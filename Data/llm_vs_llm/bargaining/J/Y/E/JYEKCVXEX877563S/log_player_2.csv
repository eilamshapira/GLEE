"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering me $4,000 out of the $10,000 total, which means she would get $6,000. This is not an equal split, and since I'll lose 10% of the value if I reject and move to the next round, I need to carefully consider my options.

If I reject, the $10,000 will be worth $9,000 to me in the next round, and I could propose a different split. Since I would have the power to make the offer next, I could propose a more favorable distribution.

Given that the money is worth 10% less to me each round, but not to Alice, I should make a strategic decision. I'll reject this offer to make my own proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to make a strategic offer that Alice is likely to accept, considering that she doesn't face any inflation penalty while I do. If she rejects my offer, the total will be worth 10% less to me in the next round.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering a split where I get $5,500 and Alice gets $4,500. This is more favorable to me than her initial offer, but still gives her a substantial portion. Since Alice knows I face increasing inflation penalties with each rejection, this offer balances my desire for a better share while remaining reasonable enough that she should accept rather than continuing to the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's new offer and the impact of inflation.

Alice is now offering me $3,500, which is less than her initial offer of $4,000. With 19% inflation on my end, the $3,500 would be worth approximately $2,835 in terms of round 1 value ($3,500 Ã— 0.81).

If I reject this offer, we'll move to round 4 where I can make another offer, but the money will be worth 27.1% less to me (compounding 10% inflation each round), meaning the entire $10,000 would be worth about $7,290 to me.

Alice is being strategic, knowing that my position weakens with each round due to inflation. Her current offer of $3,500 (worth $2,835 to me after inflation) is significantly worse than her initial offer.

I need to make a decision that maximizes my outcome, recognizing that Alice has a stronger negotiating position.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to make a more appealing offer that Alice will likely accept. The inflation penalty is increasing with each round, weakening my position. If Alice rejects again, the money will be worth even less to me in the next round.

{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200}

This offer gives Alice more than half of the total ($5,200) while still securing a reasonable amount for myself ($4,800). The split is more favorable to Alice than my previous offer, acknowledging the weakening of my position due to inflation. Since Alice knows that I'm losing value with each passing round while she isn't, this more balanced proposal should be attractive enough for her to accept rather than continue to the next round where she could potentially extract even more value."
