"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer to Bob considering the inflation rates for both of us.

Since money becomes worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob with each passing round, it's in both of our interests to make a fair deal quickly - but especially for Bob given his higher inflation rate.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest this split because it's close to even while giving me a slight advantage as the first mover. I believe this is fair and should be acceptable to Bob, given that if he rejects and we move to the next round, the total value will decrease more significantly for him than for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Bob's offer, taking into account the inflation rates.

If I reject Bob's offer, we move to round 3 where:
- I face another 5% inflation (money worth 90.25% of original value)
- Bob faces another 20% inflation (money worth 64% of original value)

Bob is offering me $40, which after round 2 inflation is worth $40 Ã— 0.95 = $38 in round 1 terms.

If I reject and make a new offer in round 3, even if I managed to get more dollars, the inflation would further reduce their value. Additionally, Bob would be more likely to accept a less favorable deal (in dollar terms) due to his higher inflation rate.

Given these considerations, I'll accept this offer as it provides a reasonable value considering the inflation effects.
