"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's keep it fair and split the money equally. $500000 each. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 
- The offer is a 50-50 split which appears fair
- If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
- However, due to 5% inflation, any amount I get next round will be worth 5% less to me
- If I propose 600k/400k next round and Alice accepts, my 600k would be worth 570k due to inflation
- The risk of further negotiation and inflation likely outweighs potential gains
