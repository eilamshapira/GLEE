"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Based on a subgame‐perfect reasoning—with the understanding that every additional round reduces Bob’s money by 20% while leaving my (Alice’s) money unaffected—in the equilibrium outcome I (Alice) can claim essentially all of the $100 if Bob’s acceptance threshold is his continuation value. In round 1 Bob’s alternative (if he refuses) would be to propose in round 2, but by that time any money he earns is worth only 80% of its nominal value. Working backward, Bob’s continuation value turns out to be zero (or at most, he is indifferent if offered exactly zero). In such a setting it turns out that the “rational” equilibrium proposal for me is to offer Bob nothing and keep $100 for myself.

Thus, my round 1 offer is:
{""alice_gain"": 100, ""bob_gain"": 0}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 100, ""bob_gain"": 0}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 67, ""bob_gain"": 33}"
