"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll formulate an offer that acknowledges the time pressure I face with the 10% inflation per round.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, since I face 10% inflation each round while you don't, it makes sense for us to reach an agreement quickly. I'm proposing a fair split that slightly favors me to account for this disadvantage. If we delay, the total value decreases for me, making future negotiations harder for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I believe a more even split is in order, considering the total value remains the same for me. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
