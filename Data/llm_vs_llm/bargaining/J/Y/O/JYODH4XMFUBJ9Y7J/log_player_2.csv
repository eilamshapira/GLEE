"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, since I face 10% inflation each round while you don't, it makes sense for us to reach an agreement quickly. I'm proposing a fair split that slightly favors me to account for this disadvantage. If we delay, the total value decreases for me, making future negotiations harder for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice's value of the money decreases by 10% each round, and this is the second round, the total value of the money for Alice is now $1,000,000 * 0.9 = $900,000. For me, the value remains $1,000,000.

Considering this, I'll make an offer that takes into account the decreasing value for Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 525000, 
""alice_gain"": 475000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I believe a more even split is in order, considering the total value remains the same for me. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.""}"
