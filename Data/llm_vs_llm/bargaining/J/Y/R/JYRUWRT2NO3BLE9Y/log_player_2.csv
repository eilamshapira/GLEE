"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, 50-50 split. What do you say, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","While a 50-50 split seems fair at first glance, I need to consider the inflation factor. If I reject this offer, I'll make a counter-offer next round, but the total value will be 5% less for me. If we continue going back and forth, we'll both lose value.

A 50-50 split in the first round is actually quite reasonable, especially since I don't know how inflation affects Alice. By accepting now, I secure $50 without any inflation penalty.
