"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll offer a division that I believe is fair given the 20% inflation per round that affects my potential gain.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an equal split of the money. This is fair for both of us, and we can avoid the effects of inflation by reaching an agreement now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I notice that Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation affecting me. Let me make a counter-offer that accounts for the inflation I'll face if we keep negotiating.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm asking for a slightly larger share to offset some of the inflation effects I'm experiencing. This is still a reasonable division that leaves Bob with a substantial portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I see that Bob is becoming more aggressive with his offers. Given the significant inflation I'm facing (nearly 50% less value for me after 4 rounds), I need to adjust my strategy.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm requesting a larger share to compensate for the substantial inflation effects I'm experiencing. If we continue to delay, my potential gain will be worth even less, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon."
