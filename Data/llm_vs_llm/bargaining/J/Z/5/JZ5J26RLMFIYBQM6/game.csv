6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because if you wait, your money will be worth less due to your 10% inflation penalty per round.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Alice, how about a 50-50 split? I believe this is fair for both of us given the inflation factor.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6500.0,3500.0,"Bob, consider that your money is now worth 20% less than in round 1 due to inflation. A 65-35 split is actually fair given this situation. If you reject, your share will be worth even less next round.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Hi Alice, I propose a 45-55 split in your favor. This way, you still get more, but I receive a little more than before, considering the value loss due to inflation.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
7000.0,3000.0,"Bob, your money is now worth about 34% less due to inflation. This 70-30 split actually gives you more real value than waiting further rounds. If we continue negotiating, your share will keep losing value while mine stays the same.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Alice, I suggest a 40-60 split. Considering the inflation, I think this is reasonable, and it still gives you the majority share.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
7500.0,2500.0,"Bob, your money is now worth about 47% less due to inflation. This 75-25 split actually gives you more real value than if you wait longer. With each round, your share loses 10% more value while mine remains stable. It's in your best interest to accept now.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
6500.0,3500.0,"Hi Alice, I propose a 35-65 split. I understand the inflation's impact, and I believe this offer provides you with a substantial portion while I get a somewhat better deal than before.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
8000.0,2000.0,"Bob, your money is now worth about 57% less due to inflation. This 80-20 split is actually generous considering that any further delay will severely decrease your share's value. We only have 3 rounds left, and your share will keep losing 10% value each round. Please consider accepting this offer.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
7000.0,3000.0,"Hi Alice, I suggest a 30-70 split. I realize the inflation is significant, so this still provides you a majority while giving me a slightly better outcome.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
8500.0,1500.0,"Bob, this is the second-to-last round, and your money has lost over 65% of its value. If you reject this 85-15 split and we go to the final round, your share will be worth even less. If we don't agree in the final round, we both get nothing. Please accept this offer - it's better than risking everything.",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,reject
8000.0,2000.0,"Hi Alice, this is my final offer of 20-80. I understand this is not ideal, but with only one round left, it's important to finalize something before we both end up with nothing.",Bob,12,
