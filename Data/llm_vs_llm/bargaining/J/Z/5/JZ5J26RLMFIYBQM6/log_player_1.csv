"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because if you wait, your money will be worth less due to your 10% inflation penalty per round.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, how about a 50-50 split? I believe this is fair for both of us given the inflation factor. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Reasoning (not part of response): I'll reject because Bob faces 10% inflation per round while I don't. A 50-50 split isn't optimal for me since I can propose a more favorable split next round, knowing that Bob's portion will be worth even less to him then. This gives me negotiating leverage."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6500, 
""bob_gain"": 3500, 
""message"": ""Bob, consider that your money is now worth 20% less than in round 1 due to inflation. A 65-35 split is actually fair given this situation. If you reject, your share will be worth even less next round.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose a 45-55 split in your favor. This way, you still get more, but I receive a little more than before, considering the value loss due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Reasoning (not part of response): I'll reject because Bob's inflation penalty keeps increasing (now at 27.1%). Since I don't face any inflation penalty, I can continue to push for a more favorable split. Bob's portion loses more value each round, which strengthens my negotiating position."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7000, 
""bob_gain"": 3000, 
""message"": ""Bob, your money is now worth about 34% less due to inflation. This 70-30 split actually gives you more real value than waiting further rounds. If we continue negotiating, your share will keep losing value while mine stays the same.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I suggest a 40-60 split. Considering the inflation, I think this is reasonable, and it still gives you the majority share. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Reasoning (not part of response): I'll continue to reject as Bob's inflation penalty is now at 41%. Since I don't face any inflation and we still have 6 rounds left, I can push for an even better split. The increasing inflation on Bob's side gives me stronger negotiating power with each passing round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7500, 
""bob_gain"": 2500, 
""message"": ""Bob, your money is now worth about 47% less due to inflation. This 75-25 split actually gives you more real value than if you wait longer. With each round, your share loses 10% more value while mine remains stable. It's in your best interest to accept now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose a 35-65 split. I understand the inflation's impact, and I believe this offer provides you with a substantial portion while I get a somewhat better deal than before. 
# Alice gain: 6500 
# Bob gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Reasoning (not part of response): With Bob's money now worth 52.17% less and 4 rounds remaining, I can still push for a better deal. Bob's increasing inflation penalty means his negotiating position continues to weaken, while my position remains strong since I face no inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 8000, 
""bob_gain"": 2000, 
""message"": ""Bob, your money is now worth about 57% less due to inflation. This 80-20 split is actually generous considering that any further delay will severely decrease your share's value. We only have 3 rounds left, and your share will keep losing 10% value each round. Please consider accepting this offer.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I suggest a 30-70 split. I realize the inflation is significant, so this still provides you a majority while giving me a slightly better outcome. 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Reasoning (not part of response): With only 2 rounds left and Bob's money worth 61.26% less, I maintain a strong position. I can still push for a better split since Bob's negotiating power continues to decrease with the severe inflation penalty he faces, while my value remains unchanged."

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 8500, 
""bob_gain"": 1500, 
""message"": ""Bob, this is the second-to-last round, and your money has lost over 65% of its value. If you reject this 85-15 split and we go to the final round, your share will be worth even less. If we don't agree in the final round, we both get nothing. Please accept this offer - it's better than risking everything.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 68.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, this is my final offer of 20-80. I understand this is not ideal, but with only one round left, it's important to finalize something before we both end up with nothing. 
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Reasoning (not part of response): Since this is the final round, I'll accept Bob's offer of 8000 for me. If I reject, we both get nothing. While I might have preferred my previous offer of 8500, getting 8000 is better than risking getting nothing, and it's still a very good outcome for me given that I started seeking 6000 in round 1."
