"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take 99.9% and leave you 0.1%. Fair enough, right? 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Reasoning (not part of response): This is an extremely unfair offer. Even with the 10% depreciation per round, I have a better chance of getting a fair deal by making a counter-offer in the next round. With 11 rounds remaining and only being offered 0.1% ($1,000), it's worth rejecting and proposing a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it 50-50. This way we both walk away with a significant amount rather than risk further depreciation.""}

Reasoning (not part of response): I'm proposing a perfectly fair split because:
1. It's the most rational and equitable solution
2. If Alice rejects this, both of us will lose 10% value in the next round
3. A 50-50 split is the most likely to be accepted and end the game quickly
4. After Alice's very unfair first offer, showing fairness might help establish better cooperation"
