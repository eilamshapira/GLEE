Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I believe a 55-45 split in my favor is fair considering the inflation impact on my side. Let's settle this now before the value decreases further. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
