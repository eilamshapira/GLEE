"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split this fairly. I propose 60 for me and 40 for you. This is a generous offer, and it's in both our interests to accept now before inflation potentially makes things worse. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""alice_gain"": 45,

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concern about inflation. How about we meet in the middle? I propose 52 for me and 48 for you. This split acknowledges your concerns while still giving me a slightly larger share to account for my time and effort. Let's take this deal! 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
