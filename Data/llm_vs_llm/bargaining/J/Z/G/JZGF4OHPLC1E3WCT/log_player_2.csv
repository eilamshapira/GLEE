"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer gives me $100,000 and Alice $900,000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to inflation:
   - For me, money will be worth 20% less next round
   - For Alice, money will be worth 10% less next round
4. This gives me some negotiating leverage, but also means I shouldn't delay too long
5. The current offer is only 10% of the total - I should be able to get a better deal

Given that this is a very unfair split (90-10) and I still have strong negotiating power in the next round despite higher inflation pressure, I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me make a strategic offer:

1. Due to inflation:
   - For me, money is now worth 80% of original value
   - For Alice, money is worth 90% of original value
2. I need to make an offer that:
   - Is more attractive than what Alice could get in the next round (where values drop further)
   - Gives me a fair share
   - Has a good chance of being accepted to avoid further inflation loss

I'll propose a more balanced split, but still giving Alice a bit more to increase chances of acceptance:

{""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""alice_gain"": 600000}

This is a 40-60 split which is much fairer than the previous 10-90 offer, while still giving Alice a majority share to incentivize acceptance."
