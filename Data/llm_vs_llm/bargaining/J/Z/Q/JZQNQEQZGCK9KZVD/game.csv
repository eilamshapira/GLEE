55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a split where I get $55 and you get $45. Since inflation will affect me more severely (20% vs your 10%), this initial split compensates for that difference. If we delay, we both lose value, but I lose more. Let's make a deal now to maximize our total gain.",Alice,1,
