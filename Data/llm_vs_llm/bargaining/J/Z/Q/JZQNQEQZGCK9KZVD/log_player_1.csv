"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an initial offer to Bob that takes into account the asymmetric inflation rates we're facing.

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a split where I get $55 and you get $45. Since inflation will affect me more severely (20% vs your 10%), this initial split compensates for that difference. If we delay, we both lose value, but I lose more. Let's make a deal now to maximize our total gain.""}"
