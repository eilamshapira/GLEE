"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a split where I get $55 and you get $45. Since inflation will affect me more severely (20% vs your 10%), this initial split compensates for that difference. If we delay, we both lose value, but I lose more. Let's make a deal now to maximize our total gain. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
