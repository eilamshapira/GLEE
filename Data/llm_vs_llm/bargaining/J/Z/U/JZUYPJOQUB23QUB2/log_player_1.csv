"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this. Due to inflation, my money is worth 10% less. Bob's money is worth 20% less.

My potential gain is effectively $450,000, but it feels less because of the inflation.

I have to decide whether $450,000 now is better than whatever I might get later.

Given that it is round 2, I will take this.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
