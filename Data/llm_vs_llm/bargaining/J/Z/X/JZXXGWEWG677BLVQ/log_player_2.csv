"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a counter-offer in the next round. This offer is far too uneven, giving me only 1% of the total amount."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. While asking for more than half, this still leaves Alice with a substantial portion and accounts for the fact that I'm facing inflation pressure on my gains."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is still too unbalanced. Even though I'm facing inflation pressure, getting only $10 (which is worth even less due to 19% inflation) while Alice gets $90 is not acceptable. I'll make a more reasonable counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35}

I'm increasing my requested share slightly to 65-35 to account for the growing inflation effect on my gains. This is still a reasonable split that leaves Alice with a significant portion while protecting me from the increasing inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 15 
# Alice gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

While Alice has increased her offer slightly, $15 (which is worth even less due to 34.39% inflation) is still too low compared to her $85. We're approaching the middle of our 12 rounds, and I need to secure a better deal despite the mounting inflation pressure."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30}

I'm increasing my requested share to 70-30 to compensate for the significant inflation effect (now over 34%). Since my $70 is actually worth less than $46 in real value due to inflation, while Alice's $30 maintains its full value, this is still a reasonable proposal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

$20 with a 46.86% inflation means I'd effectively get only about $10.63 in real value, while Alice gets $80 at full value. Despite being halfway through our rounds, this offer is still too low. I'll continue negotiating for a fairer split that accounts for the severe inflation impact on my gains."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 75, ""alice_gain"": 25}

I'm increasing my requested share to 75-25 because with the current 46.86% inflation, my $75 would actually be worth about $39.86 in real value, while Alice's $25 maintains its full value. This split, accounting for inflation, is actually closer to a 61-39 split in real value terms, which is reasonable given our negotiation history."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

With 56.95% inflation, the $25 offered would only be worth about $10.76 in real value, while Alice gets $75 at full value. We're entering the final rounds, but this offer is still too low given the severe inflation impact. I'll make another counter-offer, though we need to reach an agreement soon to avoid both getting nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 80, ""alice_gain"": 20}

With just 3 rounds left and inflation at nearly 57%, I need to increase my requested share to 80-20. Even with this seemingly high split, due to inflation, my $80 would actually be worth only about $34.44 in real value, while Alice's $20 maintains its full value. In real terms, this is closer to a 63-37 split, which is fair given the circumstances and the risk of both getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement soon."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 65.13% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. With only one round left and the risk of getting nothing, it's best to secure some value now. Even though the $30 I'll receive is worth only about $10.46 in real value due to 65.13% inflation, it's better than potentially ending up with nothing if we fail to reach an agreement in the final round. Alice has shown some movement in her offers (from $1 to $30), and given the time pressure, this is the most prudent choice."
