"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split to start the negotiation.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I suggest we split the money equally - $50 each. This is a fair and reasonable division that gives us both the same amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Bob's offer gives me $45 and him $55
2. Due to inflation, Bob's $55 is actually worth $49.50 to him (10% less)
3. My $45 maintains its full value
4. While I get slightly less than my initial proposal, the difference isn't large, and prolonging the negotiation might lead to worse outcomes
