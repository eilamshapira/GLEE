"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Let's see if Alice can do better next round. Besides, with inflation, 50 in the next round will be worth less than 50 this round, so I'd want more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

If Alice is rational, she should accept this offer, as her share will be worth less in the next round due to inflation."
