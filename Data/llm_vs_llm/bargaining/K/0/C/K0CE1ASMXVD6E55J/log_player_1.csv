"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer to split the $1,000,000 with Bob. Given that I'll lose 10% of the value each round, I should make a reasonable first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose that I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000. This is a fair split considering that delays affect my earnings more than Bob's due to the 10% inflation penalty I face each round."
