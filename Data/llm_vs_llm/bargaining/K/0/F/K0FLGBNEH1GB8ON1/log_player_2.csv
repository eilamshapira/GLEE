"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice has proposed a split where she gets $6,000 and I get $4,000. While this isn't an even split, I need to consider the inflation factor. If I reject, the total value decreases by 10% for me in the next round, meaning we'd be dividing the equivalent of $9,000 from my perspective.

Let me think about this strategically. If I reject and propose a more favorable split next round, Alice might reject as well, and we'd lose more value to inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer that accounts for inflation but still attempts to be fair enough that Alice will accept.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an even 50-50 split. This is fair and equitable, and I hope Alice will accept this balanced division rather than continuing with further rounds where we both lose value to inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","This is quite surprising! Alice has offered me the entire $10,000 and is taking nothing for herself. Even with the 19% inflation on my end, this is extremely favorable for me.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept this offer. This gives me the entire $10,000, which even after the 19% inflation effect is much better than any other reasonable division we might reach in future rounds."
