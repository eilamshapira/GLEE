"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it evenly, no need to gamble 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. With Alice offering an even split of $500,000 each:

1. This is a fair offer at face value
2. However, this is the first round, and I have the opportunity to make a counter-offer
3. Due to inflation, if I accept now, I get $500,000 at full value
4. If I reject and we continue negotiating, future gains will be worth less to me (10% less each round)
5. While I could try to negotiate for more, there's risk in doing so, and the inflation penalty makes waiting costly

Given that:
- It's a fair initial offer
- I get full value in round 1
- Future rounds will be worth less to me
- There's risk in continued negotiation
