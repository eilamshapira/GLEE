125000.0,875000.0,"Bob, time is moneyâ€”literally. If you reject, you'll get to propose in round 4, but your share will suffer a 30% inflation penalty, effectively capping your value at around $700000. By accepting now, you secure an offer worth 80% of your nominal amount (i.e. $875000 nominal becomes $700000 in real terms). This deal matches your best alternative, so why risk further devaluation? Accept and let's close this.",Alice,3,
