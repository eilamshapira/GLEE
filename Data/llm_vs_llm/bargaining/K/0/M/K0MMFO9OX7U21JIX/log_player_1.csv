"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 1000000, ""bob_gain"": 0, ""message"": ""Bob, accepting this offer immediately is in your best interest. If you delay, the value of your share will drop by 10% each round, and in equilibrium you can expect nothing. I propose that you take this offer now to avoid further losses.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, a fair split! 60/40. The longer we wait, the less my share is worth. Accept now for a guaranteed 400k for you. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 125000, ""bob_gain"": 875000, ""message"": ""Bob, time is moneyâ€”literally. If you reject, you'll get to propose in round 4, but your share will suffer a 30% inflation penalty, effectively capping your value at around $700,000. By accepting now, you secure an offer worth 80% of your nominal amount (i.e. $875,000 nominal becomes $700,000 in real terms). This deal matches your best alternative, so why risk further devaluation? Accept and let's close this.""}"
