"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, accepting this offer immediately is in your best interest. If you delay, the value of your share will drop by 10% each round, and in equilibrium you can expect nothing. I propose that you take this offer now to avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 0 
# Alice gain: 1000000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Alice, a fair split! 60/40. The longer we wait, the less my share is worth. Accept now for a guaranteed 400k for you.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is moneyâ€”literally. If you reject, you'll get to propose in round 4, but your share will suffer a 30% inflation penalty, effectively capping your value at around $700000. By accepting now, you secure an offer worth 80% of your nominal amount (i.e. $875000 nominal becomes $700000 in real terms). This deal matches your best alternative, so why risk further devaluation? Accept and let's close this. 
# Bob gain: 875000 
# Alice gain: 125000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
