"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to make a fair offer that Bob will accept, but I should account for the inflation penalty I face. In each round, my share is worth 5% less, so it's in my interest to reach an agreement quickly.

Given this, I'll offer Bob a slightly higher amount to incentivize him to accept immediately.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing that I receive $550,000 and Bob receives $450,000. This gives Bob a significant share while still allowing me to secure a fair portion before inflation reduces its value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Bob has offered me $400,000 and wants to take $600,000 for himself.

If I reject and we go to round 3, my money will be worth another 5% less, meaning I'd only get 90.25% of the value compared to round 1. If I make an offer in round 3, Bob might reject again, leading to even more inflation penalties for me.

$400,000 now is worth more than potentially getting a higher amount that's significantly devalued by inflation in future rounds. Bob is not affected by inflation, so he has a strategic advantage in prolonging negotiations.

Given these considerations:
