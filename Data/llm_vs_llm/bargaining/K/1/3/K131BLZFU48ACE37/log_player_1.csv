We are getting very close to the end and Bob is still playing this game.  It seems likely that Bob is experiencing less inflation than I am, or perhaps none at all.  Holding out a bit longer might force him to give a better offer, as the game ending in a stalemate would be a loss for both of us."

I'm holding out hope that Bob will make a move toward a more equitable split in the last round. If he doesn't, this offer ensures I get slightly more than him even with the heavy inflation working against me."

It's the last round, and Bob is still sticking to his unfavorable split.  It's clear he's experiencing significantly less impact from inflation, if any at all. Accepting this offer is the only way to guarantee I get anything."
