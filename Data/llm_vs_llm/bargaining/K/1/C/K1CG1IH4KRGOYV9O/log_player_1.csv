"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a fair offer that takes into account the inflation effect that I'm experiencing.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering a slightly higher amount for myself because I know that with each passing round, the money becomes worth 5% less to me due to inflation. This is a fair split that gives you a substantial portion while accounting for my inflation risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
