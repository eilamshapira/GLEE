"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7917, ""bob_gain"": 2083, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I’m offering you $2083 while I take $7917. Considering that waiting further reduces the value of the money (5% per round for me and 20% per round for you), this offer reflects a fair split that acknowledges your higher discount rate. I believe this is a timely and mutually beneficial deal—please let me know if you accept.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but considering the different discount rates, I believe a fair split would be more balanced. I'm offering an equal split of $5000 each. This way, we both get an equal share, and it accounts for the different discount rates affecting us. Let's make a deal that benefits both of us equally. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 3330, ""bob_gain"": 6670, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for round 3. I’m suggesting that I take $3330 and you get $6670. With the current round’s discount factors (money for me is worth 90% of its face value and for you 60%), your share would effectively be worth about $4002 if you accept now. If you reject and wait until round 4, you’d have the chance to propose, but by then your money’s value will drop further (worth only 40% of its face value), which would leave you with an effective payoff around $4000 or less after having to make a concession to me. I believe this deal is efficient for both of us given the inflation penalties. I hope you agree to make a deal today!""}"
