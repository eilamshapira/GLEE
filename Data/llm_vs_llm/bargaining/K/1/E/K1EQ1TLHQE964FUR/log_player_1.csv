"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob in this first round, considering that inflation will reduce the value of money by 5% for me in each subsequent round.

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a fair split where I get $55 and you get $45. This is a reasonable offer that benefits both of us, and accepting now means we both avoid potential losses from inflation in future rounds.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I suggest we split the money equally, $50 each. This is fair and ensures neither of us loses more to inflation. Accepting this offer will keep the game short and beneficial for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
