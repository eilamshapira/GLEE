Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 42.5 
# Alice gain: 57.5 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This offer is better than the previous one and the impact of inflation on my potential earnings makes me want to accept sooner rather than later."
