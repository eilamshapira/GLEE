"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and end this quickly 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if this offer is fair given the game conditions.

Alice is proposing a 40-60 split in her favor. While not perfectly equal, accepting now means I get $40 right away. If I reject, we go to round 2 where I can make an offer, but the total amount will be worth 10% less (so $90 total to divide).

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2, even if I propose a more favorable split for myself, Alice might reject. Then we'd continue losing 10% each round.

This isn't an equal split, but it's reasonably fair and avoids the risk of further devaluation.
