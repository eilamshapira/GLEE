Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I think we should consider a more balanced split. Since you face a 5% inflation per round and I don't, I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. This is actually fair because if we continue negotiating, your share loses value while mine doesn't. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
