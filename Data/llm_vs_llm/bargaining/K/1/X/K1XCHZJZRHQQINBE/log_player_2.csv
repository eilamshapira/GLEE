"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, Bob. This is a good deal for you. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, I think we should consider a more balanced split. Since you face a 5% inflation per round and I don't, I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. This is actually fair because if we continue negotiating, your share loses value while mine doesn't.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, since you rejected my fair offer, let's try this. Still a good deal for you, considering the inflation I'm facing. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
