Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your concern about inflation, but I believe a more equitable split would be $55 for me and $45 for you. This is still a good deal for both of us, and we can avoid further inflation losses by agreeing now. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see that inflation is affecting you more severely than me. Let's make a fair deal now - $52 for me and $48 for you. This is better for you than your last offer given the increasing inflation rates, and it's reasonable for both of us. We should close this deal now before further value is lost. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This offer is barely acceptable. While not ideal, it's better to take a less favorable deal than risk losing everything to inflation."
