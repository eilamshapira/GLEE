"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I'm proposing I take $60 and you take $40. It's important to settle this early before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100, which means I would get 40% of the total amount. While this isn't exactly equal, she does make a valid point about inflation - if I reject this, my next offer would effectively be worth 10% less.

However, I think I can get a better deal. Even with the 10% inflation in the next round, I could propose a more favorable split for myself. Given that we have 12 rounds total, there's still room for negotiation without risking too much value loss.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while acknowledging the inflation concern.

{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your concern about inflation, but I believe a more equitable split would be $55 for me and $45 for you. This is still a good deal for both of us, and we can avoid further inflation losses by agreeing now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but inflation is hitting me hard. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ let's split it $55 for me and $45 for you. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:
1. Alice is offering me $45, but due to 19% inflation, it's actually worth about $36.45 to me
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the inflation will increase to 29% for me
3. Alice seems to be under even higher inflation pressure (36%)
4. We still have 9 rounds left, but the value is deteriorating quickly
5. Her current offer is actually worse for me than her first offer ($40 without inflation)

Given that the inflation is hitting harder with each round and Alice's inflation rate is even higher than mine, I think I can get a better deal in the next round. She might be more willing to compromise due to her higher inflation rate.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Given that Alice is experiencing higher inflation than me, and we both need to reach an agreement soon to avoid losing too much value, I'll make a balanced offer that should be attractive to both of us.

{""bob_gain"": 52,
""alice_gain"": 48,
""message"": ""Alice, I see that inflation is affecting you more severely than me. Let's make a fair deal now - $52 for me and $48 for you. This is better for you than your last offer given the increasing inflation rates, and it's reasonable for both of us. We should close this deal now before further value is lost.""}"
