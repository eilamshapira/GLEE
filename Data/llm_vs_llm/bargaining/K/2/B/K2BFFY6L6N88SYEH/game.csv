68.97,31.03,"Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $68.97 and you receive $31.03. Given that each round dilutes our shares (5% for me and 10% for you), accepting this offer now ensures you get the best possible outcome. Let’s agree now to avoid further losses.",Alice,1,

60.0,40.0,"Alice, your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor.  While I understand the impact of inflation, a 60/40 split feels more equitable in the long run.  What do you think?",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, I understand your proposal and the inflation dynamics in play. Accepting your offer now ensures I secure 60 dollars (albeit at a 5% discount, effective 57 dollars in Round 1 value) without risking further reductions by prolonging negotiations. I’m on board with your 60/40 division.",Alice,2,accept
