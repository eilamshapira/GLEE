"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 68.97, ""bob_gain"": 31.03, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $68.97 and you receive $31.03. Given that each round dilutes our shares (5% for me and 10% for you), accepting this offer now ensures you get the best possible outcome. Let’s agree now to avoid further losses.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor.  While I understand the impact of inflation, a 60/40 split feels more equitable in the long run.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Bob, I understand your proposal and the inflation dynamics in play. Accepting your offer now ensures I secure 60 dollars (albeit at a 5% discount, effective 57 dollars in Round 1 value) without risking further reductions by prolonging negotiations. I’m on board with your 60/40 division.""}"
