Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $68.97 and you receive $31.03. Given that each round dilutes our shares (5% for me and 10% for you), accepting this offer now ensures you get the best possible outcome. Letâ€™s agree now to avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 31.03 
# Alice gain: 68.97
