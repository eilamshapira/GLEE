"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to factor in the inflation rates for both myself (Alice) and Bob when making my offer. Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

My reasoning: I'm aiming for a split that is initially favorable to me but still attractive enough for Bob to accept, considering his lower inflation rate. If he rejects, the money will be worth less to both of us in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Before I make my decision, let's consider the inflation.

*   **Alice's perspective:** My potential gain of $40 is now worth 20% less than it would have been in Round 1. This means the effective value to me is $40 * (1 - 0.20) = $32.

*   **Bob's perspective:** His potential gain of $60 is worth 5% less than it would have been in Round 1. This means the effective value to him is $60 * (1 - 0.05) = $57.

Now, I need to decide if $32 is a reasonable amount to accept, given the alternative of moving to Round 3 where the money will be worth even less.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
