500000.0,500000.0,"I understand you face a 10% inflation penalty each round, which puts time pressure on you. However, a fair 50-50 split seems reasonable as a compromise. This way you'll get $500000 now rather than facing further depreciation if negotiations continue. This is a good deal considering your time constraints.",Bob,2,
