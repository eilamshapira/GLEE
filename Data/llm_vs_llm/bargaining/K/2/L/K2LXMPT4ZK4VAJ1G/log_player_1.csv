"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, considering that time pressure affects me more than you due to the 10% inflation penalty I face each round.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you face a 10% inflation penalty each round, which puts time pressure on you. However, a fair 50-50 split seems reasonable as a compromise. This way you'll get $500000 now rather than facing further depreciation if negotiations continue. This is a good deal considering your time constraints. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
