"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, considering that time pressure affects me more than you due to the 10% inflation penalty I face each round. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer of a 60-40 split, where I would get $400,000 and she would get $600,000.

Let me analyze this situation:
- Alice is correct that she faces a 10% inflation penalty each round, while I face 0% inflation
- If I reject and propose my own offer next round, Alice may reject it since her share would be worth 10% less to her
- The longer we negotiate, the worse it gets for Alice, so I actually have leverage
- $400,000 is a significant amount, but I could potentially get more

Given my strong negotiating position (I don't face inflation penalties), I believe I can get a more favorable split by making a counter-offer in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that acknowledges the inflation pressure Alice faces while giving myself a better position than the initial 40-60 split.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""I understand you face a 10% inflation penalty each round, which puts time pressure on you. However, a fair 50-50 split seems reasonable as a compromise. This way you'll get $500,000 now rather than facing further depreciation if negotiations continue. This is a good deal considering your time constraints.""}"
