"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, 60/40 seems reasonable 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I (Bob) get 4000$ while she gets 6000$. This is a 40/60 split in her favor.

If I reject and go to the next round, I can make my own proposal, but I'll be affected by 5% inflation, meaning the total value to me would be 9,500$ instead of 10,000$. That means even if I proposed a 50/50 split in the next round (which Alice might reject), my maximum potential gain would be 4,750$.

Since 4,000$ now is better than potentially getting nothing if negotiations break down, and not significantly worse than the maximum I could reasonably expect in the next round after inflation, I should accept this offer.
