"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 473684 
# Alice gain: 526316 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me 473,684$ and keeping 526,316$ for herself
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. For Alice, the money will be worth 10% less next round
4. This means in the next round, to match her current value of 526,316$, I would only need to offer her 585,907$ (526,316$ / 0.9)
5. I could potentially get a better deal by rejecting and offering something that takes advantage of this inflation effect

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice faces 10% inflation per round, I can use this to my advantage. I'll offer her slightly more in nominal terms, but it's worth less to her due to inflation, while giving myself a better deal.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

This is a strategic offer because:
1. For Alice, 400,000$ in this round is worth 360,000$ (due to 10% inflation)
2. It's still a substantial amount that should be attractive to accept
3. If she rejects, her next offer will be subject to even more inflation
4. The offer appears fair as it's a clean 60-40 split"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 565217 
# Alice gain: 434783 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me 565,217$ (worth full value to me)
2. She's keeping 434,783$ (worth only 81% of original value to her, so ~352,174$ in round 1 value)
3. If I reject:
   - Next round her money will be worth 29% less than round 1
   - I could make another offer, but she's already moved significantly in my favor
   - There's a risk she might offer less favorable terms if I reject

This is actually a good offer for me:
- I get more than my original share
- The nominal amount I'm getting (565,217$) is significantly higher than what I would have gotten in round 1
- Further negotiation might risk losing this favorable position
