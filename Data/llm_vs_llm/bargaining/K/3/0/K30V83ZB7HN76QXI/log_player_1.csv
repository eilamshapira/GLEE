"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your note regarding the future devaluation risk. To avoid additional rounds and potential further loss for you, I'm proposing a division where I receive $55 and you get $45. I believe this is a fair compromise given the circumstancesâ€”let's settle quickly to prevent further inflation impacts. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
