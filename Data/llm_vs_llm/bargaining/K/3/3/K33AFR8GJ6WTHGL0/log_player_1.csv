"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a fair offer to Bob, considering the inflation effect for me.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 50-50 split which is fair for both of us. With inflation affecting me by 20% each round, it's in both our interests to agree now rather than delaying.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're concerned about inflation, but I believe a 60/40 split is more in line with a fair outcome.  Let's settle this now and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider the offer carefully given the inflation effect on my potential gains.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 3, any amount I receive would be worth 40% less than in round 1 (20% less from round 1 to 2, and another 20% from round 2 to 3). So $50 in round 3 would only be worth $30 to me due to inflation.

Bob is offering me $40 now, which after the current 20% inflation is worth $32 to me. This is better than what I might get if we continue to the next round.
