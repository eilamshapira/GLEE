"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, the $4000 offered to me is actually worth $4000 * 0.95 = $3800.

Considering this, I think the offer is not in my favor.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Due to inflation, the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, and 10% less than in the first round (5% in round 1 + 5% in round 2). The money Bob gains is worth 40% less than in the first round (20% in round 1 + 20% in round 2).

Considering this, I'll make a new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 14.26% less, the $3500 offered to me is actually worth $3500 * 0.8574 = $3000.90.

Considering this, I think the offer is still not in my favor, and Bob is getting a large share.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Due to inflation, the money I gain is worth 19.28% less than in the first round (14.26% + 5% in the current round). The money Bob gains is worth 59.4% less than in the first round (48.8% + 10.6% -  slight difference due to compounding, in the current round, assuming same rate as before, 20% less in the previous round, and now 10.6% less, which is (100%-48.8%)*10% = 5.12% and (100%-59.4%)*10% = 4.06%, and 10.6% = 5.12% + 4.06% + 1.48%, 1.48% is due to compounding).

Considering this, I'll make a new offer, trying to get a larger share since the money is losing value for both of us:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 22.62% less, the $3000 offered to me is actually worth $3000 * 0.7738 = $2321.40.

Considering this, and the fact that the money is losing value rapidly, I think it's better to accept this offer rather than risking further inflation and potentially getting an even worse deal.
