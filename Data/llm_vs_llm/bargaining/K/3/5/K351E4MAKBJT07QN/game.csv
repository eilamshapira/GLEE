600000.0,400000.0,"Dear Bob, I'm offering $400000 for you and $600000 for myself. Given that every subsequent round will diminish the actual value—especially for you with a 20% depreciation per round—accepting this offer now is in both our best interests. Let's secure our gains immediately and avoid the penalties of delay.",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Dear Alice, considering the rapid depreciation of the money's value for me, I propose a split of $550000 for myself and $450000 for you. This offer is more balanced given the significant impact of each round on my share. Let's agree on this to avoid further loss in value.",Bob,2,
,,"Dear Bob, I appreciate your proposal, but I believe we can do better by moving to the next round. Given the upcoming opportunity for me to propose next and the fact that your share's depreciation is steep, I must respectfully reject your offer.",Alice,2,reject
390000.0,610000.0,"Dear Bob, I understand your desire to secure more because of the steep depreciation you face in later rounds. In round 3, my effective money is worth 90% of the nominal value while yours is only 60%. To make it in your interest to accept now rather than waiting for the next round (where you’d face an even harsher 40% loss), I propose a split of $390000 for me and $610000 for you. This way, your effective gain will be about $610000 × 0.60 = $366000, which I believe is competitive with what you might secure as the proposer in round 4, considering the risks and further depreciation. I look forward to a prompt agreement that saves us both from additional losses.",Alice,3,

400000.0,600000.0,"Dear Alice, given the significant depreciation I'm facing, with my share now worth only 48% of its initial value, I propose a split of $600000 for me and $400000 for you. This offer reflects the urgency for me to secure a larger portion now, as waiting further will drastically reduce my effective gain. Let's agree on this to ensure we both walk away with meaningful amounts before the value diminishes even more.",Bob,4,
,,"Dear Bob, thank you for your proposal. Given the depreciation we face—with my funds worth about 85.74% of nominal and yours only 51.2%—your offer provides me with an effective value of roughly $342960, which is considerably better than what I could secure by waiting for the next round. I appreciate your urgency in light of the rapid reduction in value, and I accept your offer.",Alice,4,accept
