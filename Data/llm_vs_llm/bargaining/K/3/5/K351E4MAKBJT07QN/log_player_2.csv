"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm offering $400000 for you and $600000 for myself. Given that every subsequent round will diminish the actual value—especially for you with a 20% depreciation per round—accepting this offer now is in both our best interests. Let's secure our gains immediately and avoid the penalties of delay. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Dear Alice, considering the rapid depreciation of the money's value for me, I propose a split of $550,000 for myself and $450,000 for you. This offer is more balanced given the significant impact of each round on my share. Let's agree on this to avoid further loss in value.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I understand your desire to secure more because of the steep depreciation you face in later rounds. In round 3, my effective money is worth 90% of the nominal value while yours is only 60%. To make it in your interest to accept now rather than waiting for the next round (where you’d face an even harsher 40% loss), I propose a split of $390000 for me and $610000 for you. This way, your effective gain will be about $610000 × 0.60 = $366000, which I believe is competitive with what you might secure as the proposer in round 4, considering the risks and further depreciation. I look forward to a prompt agreement that saves us both from additional losses. 
# Bob gain: 610000 
# Alice gain: 390000

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Dear Alice, given the significant depreciation I'm facing, with my share now worth only 48% of its initial value, I propose a split of $600,000 for me and $400,000 for you. This offer reflects the urgency for me to secure a larger portion now, as waiting further will drastically reduce my effective gain. Let's agree on this to ensure we both walk away with meaningful amounts before the value diminishes even more.""
