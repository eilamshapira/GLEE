"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to avoid inflation eating into our gains. If you reject, the money will be worth less in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $4,000 for me
2. If I reject and propose next round:
   * Money will be worth 5% less to me
   * Maximum I could get next round would be worth: $9,500 (10,000 Ã— 0.95)
   * But Alice would likely reject an extremely unfair offer
   * And we'd lose more value in subsequent rounds

The 60-40 split isn't ideal, but:
- It's a reasonable first offer
- The inflation penalty makes waiting costly
- Getting $4,000 now is better than risking further devaluation
