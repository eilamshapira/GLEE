"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this... 

If I reject, in the next round I can make a counter-offer, but the total value will be worth 20% less to me. So the $10,000 will effectively be worth $8,000 for my share.

Alice's current offer gives me $4,000. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, even if I asked for the full $8,000 (which Alice would likely reject), I'm already at a disadvantage due to inflation.

While a 40/60 split isn't exactly equal, it's a reasonable first offer and the inflation penalty makes waiting costly for me.
