"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to make a fair offer to Bob while considering the 20% inflation that affects me each round.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose an even 50-50 split of the $10,000. While I could potentially offer less to myself to ensure Bob accepts, a fair division seems reasonable for the first round. If Bob rejects this, inflation will reduce the value for me in the next round, but I'll have the opportunity to hear what Bob considers acceptable."
