"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. I'm Alice, and I need to make an offer to Bob, keeping in mind the inflation that affects me.

Here's my offer, designed to be appealing to Bob while still giving me a good portion considering the potential for future losses due to inflation:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

Explanation: I'm proposing I get $60 and Bob gets $40. I believe this is a fair offer that Bob might accept in the first round, avoiding further inflation losses for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob rejected my initial offer and has now proposed I get $45 while he gets $55.

Considering the 20% inflation that has affected *my* potential gains, I need to calculate if this is still a worthwhile offer.

*   **Value of $45 to me now:** $45 * (1 - 0.20) = $36

Essentially, Bob is offering me the equivalent of $36 in initial value. Given that I proposed $60 initially, this is a significant drop.

However, I have to consider the risk of further inflation if I reject this offer and potentially get an even worse deal later. Since I do not know how inflation effects Bob, he might take advantage of me even further.

Therefore, I will accept this offer.
