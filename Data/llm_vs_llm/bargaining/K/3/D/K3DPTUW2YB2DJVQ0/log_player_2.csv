"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer...

$40 for me and $60 for Alice. While it's not an even split, it's still a substantial amount, and I know that with each passing round, inflation won't affect my share (0% inflation for me). However, I might be able to get a better deal by making a counter-proposal in the next round.

Since the split isn't too unfavorable and there's no risk of inflation reducing my share, I could accept this. However, I believe I can negotiate for a fairer split.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Now it's my turn to make an offer. Since I rejected Alice's 40/60 split, I should propose something that's more favorable to me while still being reasonable enough for Alice to accept.

A close-to-even split might be more fair, but slightly in my favor since I'm making the offer:

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I think this is a reasonable counter-offer because:
1. It's closer to an even split than Alice's original offer
2. I'm only asking for a modest advantage (55%)
3. If Alice rejects this, we'll lose another round to inflation (though this doesn't affect my share, it might affect hers)"
