"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose taking $5500 for myself and giving you $4500. This seems fair considering the inflation affects me more. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Alice after each round, I'll take that into consideration for my offer.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, 
""alice_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a reasonable split. It's in your best interest to accept, as the value will decrease further for you in the next round.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time. It's fair and considers the inflation affecting both of us. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, an even split might not be as favorable to me as it seems, since the money is worth less to both of us, but more so to Alice. However, it's still a significant amount, and I should weigh the risks of further inflation.
