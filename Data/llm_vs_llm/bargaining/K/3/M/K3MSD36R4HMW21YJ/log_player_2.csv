"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, what do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. Alice is proposing I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000. While I appreciate the offer, this split favors her significantly without clear justification. Since I would be the next one to make a proposal if I reject, I believe I can negotiate for a more equitable distribution.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while maintaining a cooperative tone.
