"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. How about 50/50? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Let's see if Alice can do better in the next round. Since you lose 10% of the money's value each round, it's important to weigh the options carefully."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I need a bit more to make it worthwhile, considering the inflation. How about 60/40?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation and Bob's previous request, how about 45 for me and 55 for you? 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Even though the money is worth 19% less than in the first round, accepting this offer ensures you get more than the initial 50/50 split while minimizing further inflation losses."
