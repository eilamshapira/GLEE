4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, I'm proposing a fair split that considers our different positions. Due to the 5% inflation you face each round, it's in your interest to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. This offer gives you $4500 now, which is worth more than potentially getting more in future rounds but with inflation. If we continue to the next round, your money will be worth even less, so this is a reasonable compromise.",Bob,2,
