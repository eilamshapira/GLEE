"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm proposing a fair split that considers our different positions. Due to the 5% inflation you face each round, it's in your interest to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. This offer gives you $4500 now, which is worth more than potentially getting more in future rounds but with inflation. If we continue to the next round, your money will be worth even less, so this is a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
