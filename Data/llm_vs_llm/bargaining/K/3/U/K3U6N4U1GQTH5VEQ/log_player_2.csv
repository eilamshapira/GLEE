"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split, 90% for me, 10% for you. I'm sure we can both be happy with that. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $1,000 (10%) while she gets $9,000 (90%). That's quite a lopsided division in her favor.

Since there's no inflation penalty for me in future rounds (money is worth 0% less for me each round), but Alice faces a 5% depreciation per round, I have a strategic advantage by rejecting this offer and making my own proposal next round.

If I reject, I can propose a more favorable division in the next round, and Alice would have more incentive to accept since her money would be worth 5% less.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced proposal that acknowledges our different inflation situations.

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm proposing a fair split that considers our different positions. Due to the 5% inflation you face each round, it's in your interest to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. This offer gives you $4,500 now, which is worth more than potentially getting more in future rounds but with inflation. If we continue to the next round, your money will be worth even less, so this is a reasonable compromise.""}"
