"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. It's Round 1, and I need to make an offer to Bob, keeping in mind the declining value of the money as the rounds progress. I need to balance getting a good deal for myself with making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept, considering his lower depreciation rate.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

Rationale: I'm starting with a slight advantage for myself, offering myself $60 and Bob $40. This gives me a good initial return, while still offering Bob a decent amount considering his lesser depreciation. Hopefully, this will be enough to entice him to accept in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob rejected my initial offer and is now proposing a split of $40 for me and $60 for him.

Before making a decision, I need to consider the inflation. The money I receive is now worth 20% less than in round 1. Let's call the base value of $1 in round 1 as 1.0. Then the value of $1 in round 2 is 0.8.

If I accept, I get $40, which is worth $40 * 0.8 = $32 in round 1's value.

If I reject, I'll make a counter offer in round 3. The value of money in round 3 will be worth 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 of round 1's value for me, and 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 of round 1's value for Bob.

Given that I started by offering myself $60, and Bob is now only offering me $40, I think I can risk one more round.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, it's Round 3. The stakes are getting higher, and the money is depreciating. For me, the money is now worth 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 of the original value. For Bob, it's worth 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 of the original value.

I need to make an offer that's appealing enough for Bob to accept, but also maximizes my return, considering the depreciation. I'll aim for a slightly more balanced approach this time, factoring in Bob's smaller depreciation.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

Rationale: I'm offering myself $55 and Bob $45. My gain is worth 55 * 0.64 = 35.2. Bob's gain is worth 45 * 0.81 = 36.45. Although he is receiving less, it is worth more to him. This split hopefully gives Bob the incentive to accept the offer now and avoid further depreciation. I am getting more, but I'm hoping the incentive of getting something now will be better than gambling on a higher payoff later that may not happen."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob rejected my offer again and is now proposing a split of $35 for me and $65 for him. The depreciation is really starting to bite now.

If I accept, I get $35, which is worth $35 * (1 - 0.488) = $35 * 0.512 = $17.92 in round 1's value.

If I reject, I'll make a counteroffer in round 5. In Round 5, my depreciation would be 1 - (0.8^4) = 1 - 0.4096 = 0.5904, and Bob's depreciation would be 1 - (0.9^4) = 1 - 0.6561 = 0.3439.

$17.92 is not great. But let's consider what could happen in Round 5. It's very likely Bob would demand more, and my depreciation would be even worse.

Given the circumstances, I'm leaning towards accepting this offer, despite it being low.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
