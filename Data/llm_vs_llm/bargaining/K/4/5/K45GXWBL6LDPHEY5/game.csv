950000.0,50000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose I get $950000 and you get $50000. This is fair because if we go to the next round, the total value decreases by 5% for me, meaning we'd only be dividing $950000 of effective value from my perspective. This way, we both get the maximum possible value without any loss to inflation.",Alice,1,

500000.0,500000.0,"Let's split it equally. This way, neither of us is affected by inflation, and we both get a fair share.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
902500.0,97500.0,"Bob, I'm adjusting my offer to give you more. Due to the 10% inflation I've experienced over two rounds, the fair value split would be 902500 for me and 97500 for you. This accounts for the declining value of money to me while preserving its full value for you. If we continue to the next round, I'll lose another 5% to inflation, so this is the optimal time to agree.",Alice,3,

440000.0,560000.0,"Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I think that my offer is still fair. The value of the money does not decrease for me. Let's compromise, and I will take $560000 and you will take $440000.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
857375.0,142625.0,"Bob, I'm offering you a significantly larger share now. Due to the 15% cumulative inflation I've experienced over four rounds, I need 857375 to maintain fair value. This offer gives you 142625, which is much more than my original proposal. If we move to another round, I'll face another 5% inflation, further eroding the value for me while you lose nothing. This is a fair compromise that accounts for our different inflation experiences.",Alice,5,
