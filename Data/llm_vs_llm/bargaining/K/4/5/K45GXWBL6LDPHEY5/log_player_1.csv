"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose I get $950,000 and you get $50,000. This is fair because if we go to the next round, the total value decreases by 5% for me, meaning we'd only be dividing $950,000 of effective value from my perspective. This way, we both get the maximum possible value without any loss to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it equally. This way, neither of us is affected by inflation, and we both get a fair share. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 902500, ""bob_gain"": 97500, ""message"": ""Bob, I'm adjusting my offer to give you more. Due to the 10% inflation I've experienced over two rounds, the fair value split would be 902,500 for me and 97,500 for you. This accounts for the declining value of money to me while preserving its full value for you. If we continue to the next round, I'll lose another 5% to inflation, so this is the optimal time to agree.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I think that my offer is still fair. The value of the money does not decrease for me. Let's compromise, and I will take $560000 and you will take $440000. 
# Alice gain: 440000 
# Bob gain: 560000

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 857375, ""bob_gain"": 142625, ""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you a significantly larger share now. Due to the 15% cumulative inflation I've experienced over four rounds, I need 857,375 to maintain fair value. This offer gives you 142,625, which is much more than my original proposal. If we move to another round, I'll face another 5% inflation, further eroding the value for me while you lose nothing. This is a fair compromise that accounts for our different inflation experiences.""}"
