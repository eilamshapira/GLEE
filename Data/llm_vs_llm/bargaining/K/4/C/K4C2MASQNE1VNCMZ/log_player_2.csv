"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $3000 for me, $7000 for Alice
2. If I reject, we move to next round where:
   * The total value decreases (5% for me, 10% for Alice)
   * I get to make the next proposal
3. This is a very uneven split (30/70)
4. Given the inflation rates, I could propose a better split next round and Alice would still get more value by accepting than waiting further

I'll reject this offer because it's too unbalanced, and I can make a better proposal next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer, considering the inflation rates.

Since we're in round 2:
- For me (Bob), the money is worth 95% of original value
- For Alice, it's worth 90% of original value

I'll propose a more equitable split, but slightly in my favor since Alice's inflation rate is higher, making her more likely to accept:

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

This is a reasonable 55/45 split. For Alice, $4,500 at 90% value is better than risking another round where her money would be worth even less (80% of original value). The split is also much fairer than her initial 30/70 proposal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $4500
   * With 9.75% inflation, this is worth about $4,061 in round 1 value
2. Current split is 45/55
3. If I reject:
   * Next round will have even more inflation (14.75% for me, 29% for Alice)
   * I can make another offer, but the total value keeps decreasing
4. This is a much more reasonable offer than her first one (30/70)
5. Given the increasing inflation and that this is a fair split, continuing might lead to worse outcomes for both of us

Since this is a reasonable offer and the inflation is becoming significant, I'll accept.
