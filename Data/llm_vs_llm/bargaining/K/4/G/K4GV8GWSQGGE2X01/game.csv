6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering we both need to reach an agreement quickly due to inflation affecting our gains.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Let's split it fairly, considering the inflation, I'm being generous with 55-45. Accepting this offer will ensure we both get a good deal before the money devalues further.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, since inflation is affecting you more severely (20% vs my 5% per round), we should reach an agreement soon. I'm offering you a reasonable 45% share - this is actually better for you than waiting more rounds due to your higher inflation rate.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Equal split is the fairest, considering my higher inflation rate, I'm taking a bigger risk by waiting. Let's end this with a 50-50 split before I lose even more value.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"Bob, let's be practical. Your money is already worth less than half its original value, while mine has only lost about 15%. A 60-40 split now is much better for you than waiting further rounds where your share will continue to devalue dramatically faster than mine.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"I understand the inflation impact, but I'm not giving up yet. A 48-52 split is still reasonable, considering I'm taking a huge risk with each passing round. Let's find a middle ground before it's too late.",Bob,6,
