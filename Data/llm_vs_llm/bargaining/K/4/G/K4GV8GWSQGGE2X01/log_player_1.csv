"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it fairly, considering the inflation, I'm being generous with 55-45. Accepting this offer will ensure we both get a good deal before the money devalues further. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The inflation impact on my gains is lower than Bob's, so I have a stronger negotiating position. I can make a better offer in the next round where I propose the split."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Bob, since inflation is affecting you more severely (20% vs my 5% per round), we should reach an agreement soon. I'm offering you a reasonable 45% share - this is actually better for you than waiting more rounds due to your higher inflation rate.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Equal split is the fairest, considering my higher inflation rate, I'm taking a bigger risk by waiting. Let's end this with a 50-50 split before I lose even more value. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Given that Bob's money is devaluing much faster (48.8% vs my 14.26%), I still have a stronger negotiating position. Even a 50-50 split now is not optimal for me since I can propose a more favorable split in the next round, knowing that Bob's position weakens more quickly than mine."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical. Your money is already worth less than half its original value, while mine has only lost about 15%. A 60-40 split now is much better for you than waiting further rounds where your share will continue to devalue dramatically faster than mine.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the inflation impact, but I'm not giving up yet. A 48-52 split is still reasonable, considering I'm taking a huge risk with each passing round. Let's find a middle ground before it's too late. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because:
1. While I might get a better percentage in later rounds, my money is now worth 22.62% less
2. We're halfway through our rounds, and the risk of getting nothing if we don't agree increases
3. Getting 5200 now (worth about 4024 after my inflation) is better than risking further devaluation
4. Bob is offering me the larger share (52%) despite their desperate situation, which is reasonable"
