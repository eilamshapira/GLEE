Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, since inflation is affecting you more severely (20% vs my 5% per round), we should reach an agreement soon. I'm offering you a reasonable 45% share - this is actually better for you than waiting more rounds due to your higher inflation rate.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical. Your money is already worth less than half its original value, while mine has only lost about 15%. A 60-40 split now is much better for you than waiting further rounds where your share will continue to devalue dramatically faster than mine.
