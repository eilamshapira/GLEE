"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly and end the game quickly to avoid losing value""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to be fair, but I need a better deal than that. This offer accounts for the money losing value. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I need to consider that when evaluating the offer.

The original amount I would have gotten is $6000, but now it's $5200, which is a bit less than I initially proposed. However, considering the 5% decrease in value, $5200 is equivalent to approximately $5474 in the previous round (since 5200 / 0.95 â‰ˆ 5474). This is still less than my initial proposal, but it's a reasonable offer given the circumstances.
