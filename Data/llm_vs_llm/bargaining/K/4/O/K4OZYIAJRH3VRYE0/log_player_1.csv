"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly and avoid losses due to inflation!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose an equal split of $5000 each. This is fair for both of us and avoids further inflation losses. With inflation affecting me more (10% vs your 5%), we both benefit from agreeing now. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and Bob's message, I think an equal split is reasonable, especially since the money is worth less with each passing round.
