"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly and avoid losses due to inflation! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's offer:

Alice is proposing that I get $4000 while she gets $6000.

This doesn't seem like a fair split. Since I'll lose more value to inflation (10% per round) compared to Alice (5% per round), I do have incentive to reach an agreement quickly. However, this initial offer gives Alice a significantly larger portion.

If I reject and propose in the next round, I could suggest a more equitable division, though both of us would lose some value due to inflation.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more balanced while acknowledging the inflation pressures we both face.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""I propose an equal split of $5000 each. This is fair for both of us and avoids further inflation losses. With inflation affecting me more (10% vs your 5%), we both benefit from agreeing now.""}"
