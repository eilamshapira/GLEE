"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split it 60-40. This way, we both get a good amount before inflation affects us too much. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100
2. If I reject, the next round will have 20% inflation, so the $100 will be worth $80 to me
3. A 50-50 split in the next round would give me $40, the same as now but with inflation risk
4. Alice might not accept a 50-50 split anyway

While a 60-40 split isn't perfectly equal, it's a reasonable first offer and accepting it avoids inflation risk. Getting $40 now is better than risking further negotiations with inflation.
