Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""How about we adjust it a bit? I'll take 55 and you get 45. It's only fair considering the inflation impact on me.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand inflation impacts you, but 55/45 is a bit too much of a shift. Let's meet in the middle at 52/48. It's still a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52
