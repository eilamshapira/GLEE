"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I need to consider the decreasing value of the money each round. Since it's round 1, I'll make a generous offer to try and secure a deal quickly.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. I need to consider the inflation. Bob's offer is 500,000 for me. In round 1 I proposed 550,000. I need to decide if the 50,000 difference is worth the risk of further inflation in round 3.

My initial gain would be 550,000. Now 500,000.
The money is worth 10% less.

Let's calculate the effective value of Bob's offer:

*   Bob's offer: $500,000
*   Inflation for Alice: 10%
*   Effective value for Alice: $500,000 * (1 - 0.10) = $450,000

Since the value is $450,000 now. I will reject.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, round 3. Inflation is definitely a factor now. The money I receive will be worth 20% less than in round 1. The money Bob receives will be worth 10% less than in round 1.

I need to make an offer that's attractive enough for Bob to accept, but also gives me a reasonable return considering the inflation. I will slightly decrease the amount I want and hope for the best.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 530000,
""bob_gain"": 470000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, round 4. Let's analyze Bob's offer.

*   Bob's offer: $450,000
*   Inflation for Alice: 27.1%
*   Effective value for Alice: $450,000 * (1 - 0.271) = $328,950

That's significantly less than I initially proposed. I'm getting worried about the rapid depreciation of the money. Even though it's a bad offer relatively speaking, I'm going to accept it to avoid losing even more in the future.

""decision"": ""accept""
