"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let me propose a division that takes into account the inflation pressure on both sides.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose this split because:
1. It's slightly in my favor but still fair enough to be acceptable
2. Bob faces higher inflation (10% vs my 5%), so he has more incentive to accept early
3. A 55-45 split isn't too greedy and shows willingness to compromise"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Due to inflation, if I accept now:
   * My $50 is worth $47.50 (5% less)
   * Bob's $50 is worth $45 (10% less)

2. If I reject and we continue:
   * Future rounds will be worth even less for both of us
   * I'll get another chance to make an offer, but with further reduced value

3. This is actually a reasonable offer considering:
   * It's an equal split of the nominal amount
   * The inflation effect makes it slightly in my favor in real terms
   * The risk of further value loss in future rounds
