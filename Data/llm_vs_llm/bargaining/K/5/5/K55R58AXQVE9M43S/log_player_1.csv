Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering we both want to avoid the 5% inflation penalty in future rounds.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's keep it simple and split evenly. A fair deal ensures we both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 5% inflation, if I accept this offer:
* I would get $5000, but it's worth 5% less = $4750 in round 1 value
* Bob would get $5000 at full value

If I reject and we go to round 3:
* I'll face another 5% inflation (total 10% less value)
* I might be able to propose a better split, but Bob could reject again
* The risk of further devaluation is significant

Even though this isn't optimal for me due to inflation, the risk of getting an even worse deal in future rounds makes this acceptable.
