"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it evenly, no need to gamble 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With a 50-50 split, I would get $500,000. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the money will be worth 10% less to me (effectively $450,000 for the same amount). While I could try to negotiate for more, there's a risk that Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to further depreciation of value for me.

The even split is fair, and considering the inflation penalty I face, it's better to secure a good deal now rather than risk getting less value in later rounds.
