"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split, considering that Bob faces a 5% depreciation per round while I don't.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is slightly in my favor but still quite fair, considering Bob can accept now and avoid any depreciation of his share."
