5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, let's be practical. With your 20% inflation rate versus my 10%, time hurts you more than me. I'm offering you $4500, which is worth more now than a larger amount later will be. If we keep going back and forth, we both lose significantly. This is a fair compromise considering our different inflation rates.",Alice,3,

4200.0,5800.0,"I understand your point about inflation, but I still think the split should be closer to even. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more than your last offer.",Bob,4,

5400.0,4600.0,"Bob, we're already in round 5, and your money is now worth less than half of its original value due to your 20% inflation rate. My offer of $4600 to you now is worth more than what you'd get after more rounds, even if the nominal amount were higher. Let's stop this back-and-forth that's hurting us both, but especially you with your higher inflation rate.",Alice,5,
