"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll consider the inflation rates and aim for a fair proposal.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation rate is higher for me, I think this is a fair split. We should settle now to minimize losses. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical. With your 20% inflation rate versus my 10%, time hurts you more than me. I'm offering you $4500, which is worth more now than a larger amount later will be. If we keep going back and forth, we both lose significantly. This is a fair compromise considering our different inflation rates.""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I understand your point about inflation, but I still think the split should be closer to even. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more than your last offer.

Round 5

""bob_gain"": 4600,
""message"": ""Bob, we're already in round 5, and your money is now worth less than half of its original value due to your 20% inflation rate. My offer of $4600 to you now is worth more than what you'd get after more rounds, even if the nominal amount were higher. Let's stop this back-and-forth that's hurting us both, but especially you with your higher inflation rate.""}"
