"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm proposing an even split of $5000 each. This is fair, and accepting now maximizes our combined value since the money loses value with each round.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical. With your 20% inflation rate versus my 10%, time hurts you more than me. I'm offering you $4500, which is worth more now than a larger amount later will be. If we keep going back and forth, we both lose significantly. This is a fair compromise considering our different inflation rates.

# Alice gain: 5500

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're already in round 5, and your money is now worth less than half of its original value due to your 20% inflation rate. My offer of $4600 to you now is worth more than what you'd get after more rounds, even if the nominal amount were higher. Let's stop this back-and-forth that's hurting us both, but especially you with your higher inflation rate. 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400
