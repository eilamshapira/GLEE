"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for the division of $10,000. I'll propose a split that is slightly in my favor, anticipating potential inflation concerns and Bob's potential desire for a larger share.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Before inflation, my gain would have been $5500. With 5% inflation, $5500 * 0.05 = $275. My expected gain from my previous proposal is effectively $5500 - $275 = $5225.

Bob is now offering $4000.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, considering Bob rejected my initial offer and the inflation impacting my gains, I need to adjust my strategy. I'll offer a split that's more favorable to Bob while still ensuring I get a reasonable amount. I'll aim for something slightly above the midpoint, factoring in the perceived value loss due to inflation on my end. Remember, my gain is worth 10% less now (5% in round 1, 5% in round 2).

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100 
# Bob gain: 9900 
Do you accept this offer?","Absolutely not. Bob's offer is outrageous.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, Bob is being unreasonable. I suspect he might be trying to push me to accept very little, hoping I'll cave due to the accumulating inflation. I need to make a reasonable offer, but I'm also concerned about further devaluation of my potential gains. My loss is now 14.26%.

I will make a final offer, which I think is pretty generous given the circumstances.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I'm losing a significant portion of my potential gain due to inflation (22.62%). Bob is now offering me $4800.

Let's calculate what $5000 was worth to me in round 1. It is now worth $5000 * (1 - 0.2262) = $3869.

I will accept the $4800.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
