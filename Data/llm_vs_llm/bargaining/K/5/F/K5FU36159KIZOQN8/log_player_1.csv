"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering you lose 10% value each round if you reject.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. It's a more equitable distribution considering the inflation you're not facing. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept, I get $45
2. If I reject:
   - Next round I can make a new offer
   - Bob's money will be worth another 10% less
   - My next offer might be rejected again
   - We could lose more rounds to negotiation

While $45 is less than my initial offer, it's still a decent amount. Bob's proposed split is relatively fair, and continuing the negotiation might lead to a worse outcome if we keep going back and forth with rejections.
