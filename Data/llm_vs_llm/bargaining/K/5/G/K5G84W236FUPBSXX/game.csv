5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. This gives us both an equal share of $5000 each. Since time works against me due to the 10% inflation penalty, accepting this fair offer now would be beneficial for both of us.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Hi Alice, considering the inflation penalty you face, I'm willing to take a bit more. This offer still gives you a substantial amount, and accepting now would save you from further losses due to inflation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm proposing a more balanced split of $4500 for me and $5500 for you. This acknowledges the inflation penalty I face while still being fair. If we continue to the next round, I'll lose more value and might need to propose an even less favorable split for myself. This offer gives you more than half while still being reasonable for both of us.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
3500.0,6500.0,"Alice, considering the increasing impact of inflation on your share, I'm willing to take a bit more. You've already lost 19% of the value, and it will only get worse. This offer still gives you a significant amount, and accepting now would prevent further losses.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
4200.0,5800.0,"Bob, we're both losing value by prolonging this negotiation. I'm now offering you $5800, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and substantially more than half. If we continue, I'll face even greater inflation penalties, which might force me to accept an even less favorable deal later. This is a reasonable compromise that acknowledges your stronger position while still being fair to both of us. Let's conclude this now before further rounds erode the total value for me.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"Alice, the inflation penalty is significantly impacting your share, and it will only worsen. I'm willing to take a larger portion, considering the decreasing value of your share. This offer still provides you with a substantial amount, and accepting now would prevent further losses. Prolonging the negotiation will only decrease the value of your share, making it more reasonable for you to accept this offer.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
3800.0,6200.0,"Bob, I see we're at an impasse. With inflation already reducing my share's value by over 40%, I'm offering you $6200 - which is a substantial portion of the total. This acknowledges your stronger position in the negotiation while still leaving me with a reasonable amount. If we continue further, inflation will erode my share even more, and I'll likely be forced to accept an even worse deal. This offer represents a fair compromise given the circumstances and the inflation penalty I face. Let's conclude this negotiation now.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
2500.0,7500.0,"Alice, considering the significant impact of inflation on your share, I'm willing to take an even larger portion. Your share has already lost nearly 47% of its value, and it will only continue to decrease. This offer still provides you with some value, but I believe it's reasonable given the circumstances. Prolonging the negotiation will only further erode the value of your share, making it more sensible for you to accept this offer.",Bob,8,
