"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I need to make a fair offer to Bob, considering that with each passing round, the money is worth 10% less for me but not for Bob. This gives Bob some leverage since delay affects me more than him.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. This gives us both an equal share of $5000 each. Since time works against me due to the 10% inflation penalty, accepting this fair offer now would be beneficial for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation penalty you face, I'm willing to take a bit more. This offer still gives you a substantial amount, and accepting now would save you from further losses due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I need to be strategic here. The money is now worth 20% less to me due to inflation, so I should adjust my offer accordingly while still making it attractive enough for Bob to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm proposing a more balanced split of $4500 for me and $5500 for you. This acknowledges the inflation penalty I face while still being fair. If we continue to the next round, I'll lose more value and might need to propose an even less favorable split for myself. This offer gives you more than half while still being reasonable for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the increasing impact of inflation on your share, I'm willing to take a bit more. You've already lost 19% of the value, and it will only get worse. This offer still gives you a significant amount, and accepting now would prevent further losses. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I need to be more strategic now. The money is worth about 27.1% less to me due to inflation after 3 rounds, and it will continue to decrease if we keep going.

{""alice_gain"": 4200, 
""bob_gain"": 5800, 
""message"": ""Bob, we're both losing value by prolonging this negotiation. I'm now offering you $5800, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and substantially more than half. If we continue, I'll face even greater inflation penalties, which might force me to accept an even less favorable deal later. This is a reasonable compromise that acknowledges your stronger position while still being fair to both of us. Let's conclude this now before further rounds erode the total value for me.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the inflation penalty is significantly impacting your share, and it will only worsen. I'm willing to take a larger portion, considering the decreasing value of your share. This offer still provides you with a substantial amount, and accepting now would prevent further losses. Prolonging the negotiation will only decrease the value of your share, making it more reasonable for you to accept this offer. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I need to be more realistic now. The money is worth nearly 41% less to me due to inflation after 5 rounds, and Bob has shown he's willing to wait me out.

{""alice_gain"": 3800, 
""bob_gain"": 6200, 
""message"": ""Bob, I see we're at an impasse. With inflation already reducing my share's value by over 40%, I'm offering you $6200 - which is a substantial portion of the total. This acknowledges your stronger position in the negotiation while still leaving me with a reasonable amount. If we continue further, inflation will erode my share even more, and I'll likely be forced to accept an even worse deal. This offer represents a fair compromise given the circumstances and the inflation penalty I face. Let's conclude this negotiation now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the significant impact of inflation on your share, I'm willing to take an even larger portion. Your share has already lost nearly 47% of its value, and it will only continue to decrease. This offer still provides you with some value, but I believe it's reasonable given the circumstances. Prolonging the negotiation will only further erode the value of your share, making it more sensible for you to accept this offer.

# Bob gain: 7500
