"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this.

*   **My Perspective (Alice):** Due to inflation, the $100 now feels like $90 to me. Bob's offer gives me $45. So, in terms of its value to me, I am receiving $45.
*   **Decision:**
    ```json
    {
      ""decision"": ""accept""
    }
    ```"
