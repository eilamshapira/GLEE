"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4871 
# Alice gain: 5129 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. Alice has offered me $4,871 out of the $10,000, while keeping $5,129 for herself. This is slightly less than 50% for me.

If I reject and go to the next round, I can make my own offer. However, due to inflation, the money will be worth 10% less to me then, meaning the total effective value to me would be $9,000 instead of $10,000.

If I reject and make my own offer in the next round, even if I propose to take all $10,000 (which Alice would likely reject), the maximum value to me would be $9,000 due to inflation.

Since $4,871 is greater than 50% of $9,000 ($4,500), accepting this offer makes financial sense.
