"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly with a slight advantage to me for proposing first. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $4900, which is very close to a 50-50 split
2. The difference is only $200 in Alice's favor
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
4. However, there's no guarantee Alice will accept my counter-offer
5. This is a reasonable first offer, and since there's no inflation for me, I'm not losing value by accepting now

Given these considerations, I'll accept the offer. While I could try to negotiate for a perfectly even split, the current offer is fair enough and accepting it avoids the risk of a worse outcome through continued negotiation.
