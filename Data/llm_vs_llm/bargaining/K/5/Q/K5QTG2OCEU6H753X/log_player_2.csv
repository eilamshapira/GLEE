"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $400,000 while she takes $600,000 of the $1,000,000 total.

If I reject this and move to the next round, I'd get to make an offer, but the money would be worth 10% less to me due to inflation. This means the entire $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $900,000 to me in the next round.

Since the current offer gives me $400,000, I should reject only if I believe I can secure more than $444,444 in the next round (which would be equivalent to $400,000 now, accounting for 10% inflation).

I believe I can make a better offer in the next round, so I'll reject.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a counteroffer that's better for me while still being reasonably attractive to Alice.

Since Alice initially offered me 40% of the money, I'll propose a more balanced split that favors me slightly, while acknowledging that she has leverage due to the inflation affecting me.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

This offer gives me a better share while still giving Alice a substantial portion. I'm proposing this because if Alice rejects and we go to round 3, I'll face another 10% inflation, making the money worth even less to me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's new offer in light of the inflation affecting me.

Alice is now offering me $420,000, but due to the 19% inflation affecting me, this $420,000 is actually worth only $340,200 to me (calculated as $420,000 Ã— 0.81).

In the previous round, Alice rejected my offer where I would have received $550,000. If we go to the next round, inflation will increase further for me, making each dollar worth even less.

Also, I notice Alice has increased her offer from $400,000 to $420,000, showing some willingness to compromise. Given the inflation pressure on me and the fact that Alice seems to understand she needs to improve her offers somewhat, I should accept this offer rather than risk further devaluation.
