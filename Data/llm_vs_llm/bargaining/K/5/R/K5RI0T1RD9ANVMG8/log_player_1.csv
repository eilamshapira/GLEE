"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split, taking into account that future rounds will reduce the value due to inflation for me.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose this split because I want to offer Bob a reasonable amount while protecting myself from the 20% inflation penalty if we go to another round. If Bob rejects this offer, my potential gains in the next round would be worth less to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept this offer now, I get $40, but it's worth 20% less due to inflation, so effectively I get $32
- If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount I get will be worth another 20% less
- My initial offer of $60 for me was rejected, suggesting Bob is driving a hard bargain
- Further negotiation will continue to reduce the real value of my gains more than Bob's

Given these factors, I should accept this offer as further rounds will only decrease my purchasing power more significantly than Bob's.
