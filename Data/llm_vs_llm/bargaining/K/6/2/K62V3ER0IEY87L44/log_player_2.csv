"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair split, considering I'm the one making the first offer.  Let's get this done! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Alice's offer of a 40-60 split in her favor.

While I could reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, there's risk in prolonging the negotiation. I'd receive $40 which is a significant portion, and accepting now guarantees this amount rather than risking potential breakdown in negotiations.
