"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer carefully:

Alice is proposing an equal split of the $100:
- $50 for me (Bob)
- $50 for Alice

This is a perfectly fair division that gives us both equal shares. If I reject, we'll move to the next round where I can make an offer, but the total amount will decrease by 20% to $80 total, meaning even if I proposed a more favorable split for myself, the maximum I could get would be less than $80.

Since 50% of $100 is better than any percentage of $80, accepting this offer is the rational choice.
