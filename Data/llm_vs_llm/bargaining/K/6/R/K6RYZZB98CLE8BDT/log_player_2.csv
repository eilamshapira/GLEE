Alice's offer:

Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is literally money for me in this game!  I'm willing to compromise, but this offer considers the time pressure we're both under. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

I'm holding out for a better deal. Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation, even though I don't know the exact percentage.  My turn to propose next, and I'll try to nudge her closer to a more even split."
