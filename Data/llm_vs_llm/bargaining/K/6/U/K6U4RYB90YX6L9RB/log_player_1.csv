"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,

""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split, which is fair considering future discounting""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it equally. Considering the discount, I'm at a disadvantage, so this is fair. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. If I accept Bob's 50-50 offer:
   * I get $50 (full value)
   * Bob gets $50 (but worth 10% less to him = $45 in round 1 value)

2. If I reject and make another offer in round 3:
   * Bob will face a 20% discount in that round
   * But Bob might reject again, leading to further rounds

The current offer gives me a fair share, and considering Bob is already accepting a loss due to inflation, this seems reasonable. If I reject, I risk a less favorable outcome in future rounds.
