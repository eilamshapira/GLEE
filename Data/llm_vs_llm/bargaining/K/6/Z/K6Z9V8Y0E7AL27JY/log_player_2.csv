"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, but slightly in my favor to incentivize accepting this round. Think of the inflation! 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

The offer is slightly in Alice's favor (52.5% vs 47.5%), but she makes a valid point about inflation. If I reject:
- Next round I can make an offer
- But the total value will be reduced by 5% (worth $950,000)
- Even if I propose a better split for myself, Alice could reject and the cycle continues

$475,000 is still a very substantial amount. While not perfectly equal, the difference of $50,000 is less than what we'd lose to inflation in just one round. It's a reasonable first offer.
