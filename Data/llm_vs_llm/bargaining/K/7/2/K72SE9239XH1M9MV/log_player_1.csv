"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me think strategically about this. Since Bob loses more value (10%) than I do (5%) each round, he has more incentive to accept an early offer. However, I don't want to be too greedy and risk rejection.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, considering that if Bob rejects this, the total value will decrease more significantly for him than for me in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept now:
   * I get $400,000 at 95% value = $380,000 effective value
   * Bob gets $600,000 at 90% value = $540,000 effective value

2. If I reject and propose in next round:
   * Values will decrease further (to 90% and 80% of original)
   * I could propose a different split, but Bob might reject again
   * Further delays reduce value for both of us, but more for Bob

The current offer gives me less than my initial proposal, but considering the inflation effect, prolonging the negotiation might lead to worse outcomes for both parties.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer as I believe I can get a better deal in the next round, given that Bob faces higher inflation pressure."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In this round, any money I receive is worth 90% of the original value, and any money Bob receives is worth 80% of the original value. Bob's position is weakening faster than mine, so I can be a bit more aggressive, but still need to make it worthwhile for him to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}

I'm proposing a 65-35 split. For Bob, $350,000 at 80% value equals $280,000 effective value. If he rejects this, the next round will reduce his value to 70% of original, making any future gains significantly less valuable for him. This should make accepting now more attractive than continuing the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept now:
   * I get $450,000 at 85.74% value = $385,830 effective value
   * Bob gets $550,000 at 72.9% value = $400,950 effective value

2. If I reject and propose in next round:
   * Values will decrease further
   * I lose another 5% (to about 81% of original value)
   * Bob loses another 10% (to about 63% of original value)
   * The total pie is shrinking significantly

Bob has improved his offer from last time ($450K vs $400K), and the inflation is really starting to eat into our potential gains. While I might be able to get a slightly better deal in the next round, the risk and guaranteed value loss might not be worth it.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because the inflation costs are becoming significant, and this is a reasonable compromise from Bob's previous position."
