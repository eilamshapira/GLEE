"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $40 while she gets $60. 

Since the rules state that with each round, money is worth 5% less for Alice but 0% less for me, I have some negotiating leverage. If we go to the next round, I can make a counter-offer, and the $100 would still be worth the full $100 to me, but would only be worth $95 to Alice.

I think I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a counter-offer that takes into account the inflation affecting Alice while being fair.

Since the money is now worth 5% less to Alice, I can offer her a bit less than she offered me while still providing her with good value. I'll propose a more balanced split that favors me slightly.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

For my explanation to Alice: I'm proposing a more balanced split where I get $55 and you get $45. Since the money is worth 5% less to you this round, this offer is still valuable for you while being more fair to me."
