"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate this offer considering the inflation factor.

While $300,000 is a substantial amount, I need to think strategically. If I reject now, I can make a counter-offer, but I'll face 5% inflation. However, I believe I can secure a more favorable distribution.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more balanced offer that accounts for inflation and provides a fair distribution.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I suggest we split the money equally. This is fair to both of us and allows us to resolve this quickly before inflation reduces the value further. A 50-50 split is the most equitable solution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer with inflation in mind.

Alice has increased her offer to me from $300,000 to $350,000. However, with 9.75% inflation for my share, $350,000 now is worth about $315,875 in original value. This is only slightly better than her first offer.

If I reject and we go to round 4, I'll face even more inflation. However, I could still potentially negotiate a better deal. But Alice doesn't face inflation, so she has less pressure to agree quickly.

Given the increasing inflation risk for me and Alice's modest improvement in the offer, I'll accept this deal.
