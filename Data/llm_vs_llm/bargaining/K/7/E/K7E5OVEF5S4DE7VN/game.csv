4685.59,5314.41,"Bob, I propose a division right now to avoid any future devaluation on your side. In this offer, you would receive $5314.41 and I would receive $4685.59—this is the result of a fair, backward‐induction reasoning over our 12 rounds (given your 10% per round discount and my constant valuation). I believe accepting this now is in both our best interests.",Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your backward-induction reasoning, but I believe a slightly more favorable split for me is fair in this early round. I'm proposing $5500 for me and $4500 for you. This still gives you a substantial portion while recognizing that I should receive a bit more in earlier rounds to offset my time disadvantage. If we keep rejecting offers, we both risk losing value - especially me with the 10% depreciation. Let's reach an agreement quickly and ensure we both benefit.",Bob,2,

4800.0,5200.0,"Bob, as we enter round 3, the cost of delay becomes even clearer. Every passing round reduces the value of the money you receive by an extra 10%—so while my share remains constant, your share’s present value declines: what you’d get in round 3 is effectively 81% of the nominal amount. To avoid further loss, I propose a division of $5200 nominal for you and $4800 for me. This offer gives you an effective value of about $4212 if accepted now, which is more favorable than waiting for your turn in round 4 (when your money would drop further in value). I believe this is a fair deal given the circumstances—let’s settle now before further discounting hurts both of us.",Alice,3,
