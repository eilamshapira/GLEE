"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 4685.59, ""bob_gain"": 5314.41, ""message"": ""Bob, I propose a division right now to avoid any future devaluation on your side. In this offer, you would receive $5314.41 and I would receive $4685.59—this is the result of a fair, backward‐induction reasoning over our 12 rounds (given your 10% per round discount and my constant valuation). I believe accepting this now is in both our best interests.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your backward-induction reasoning, but I believe a slightly more favorable split for me is fair in this early round. I'm proposing $5500 for me and $4500 for you. This still gives you a substantial portion while recognizing that I should receive a bit more in earlier rounds to offset my time disadvantage. If we keep rejecting offers, we both risk losing value - especially me with the 10% depreciation. Let's reach an agreement quickly and ensure we both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 4800, ""bob_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Bob, as we enter round 3, the cost of delay becomes even clearer. Every passing round reduces the value of the money you receive by an extra 10%—so while my share remains constant, your share’s present value declines: what you’d get in round 3 is effectively 81% of the nominal amount. To avoid further loss, I propose a division of $5200 nominal for you and $4800 for me. This offer gives you an effective value of about $4212 if accepted now, which is more favorable than waiting for your turn in round 4 (when your money would drop further in value). I believe this is a fair deal given the circumstances—let’s settle now before further discounting hurts both of us.""}"
