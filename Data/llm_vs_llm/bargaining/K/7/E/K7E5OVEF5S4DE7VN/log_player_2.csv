"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I propose a division right now to avoid any future devaluation on your side. In this offer, you would receive $5314.41 and I would receive $4685.59—this is the result of a fair, backward‐induction reasoning over our 12 rounds (given your 10% per round discount and my constant valuation). I believe accepting this now is in both our best interests. 
# Bob gain: 5314.41 
# Alice gain: 4685.59 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to analyze Alice's offer carefully. 

She's proposing that I get $5,314.41 and she gets $4,685.59. She claims this is based on backward-induction reasoning considering my 10% discount per round.

Let me think about this: With each passing round, the money is worth 10% less to me, while Alice faces no depreciation. This means my bargaining power decreases over time, so there's merit in accepting a fair offer early.

However, I should verify if this split truly represents a fair equilibrium solution. In the final round (round 12), I would be desperate to accept almost anything, so Alice could offer me very little. Working backward, this affects earlier rounds' equilibrium points.

The offer seems reasonable given my disadvantage, but I believe I could get slightly more in the first round.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable given our positions while acknowledging the time pressure I face.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your backward-induction reasoning, but I believe a slightly more favorable split for me is fair in this early round. I'm proposing $5,500 for me and $4,500 for you. This still gives you a substantial portion while recognizing that I should receive a bit more in earlier rounds to offset my time disadvantage. If we keep rejecting offers, we both risk losing value - especially me with the 10% depreciation. Let's reach an agreement quickly and ensure we both benefit.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, as we enter round 3, the cost of delay becomes even clearer. Every passing round reduces the value of the money you receive by an extra 10%—so while my share remains constant, your share’s present value declines: what you’d get in round 3 is effectively 81% of the nominal amount. To avoid further loss, I propose a division of $5200 nominal for you and $4800 for me. This offer gives you an effective value of about $4212 if accepted now, which is more favorable than waiting for your turn in round 4 (when your money would drop further in value). I believe this is a fair deal given the circumstances—let’s settle now before further discounting hurts both of us. 
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to analyze this offer carefully.

Alice is offering me $5,200, which after accounting for the 19% inflation in this round (round 3), would be worth about $4,212 to me now.

If I reject and we move to round 4, my effective discount would increase to 27.1% (1 - 0.9^3), meaning my bargaining position would weaken further. If I were to counter with the same nominal amount I just offered ($5,500), it would only be worth about $4,010 to me after the additional round of inflation.

Alice's offer has improved from her initial proposal and is actually fairly reasonable considering my declining position. The longer we negotiate, the more value I lose relative to Alice. While I might ideally want more, further delays will only hurt my position more significantly.
