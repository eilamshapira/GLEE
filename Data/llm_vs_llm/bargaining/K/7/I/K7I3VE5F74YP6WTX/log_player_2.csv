"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to kick things off quickly and avoid the inflation penalty on my end, I’m proposing a near‐fair split: $45 for me and $55 for you. I believe this is a fair start that benefits us both if we settle immediately. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's offer.

Alice is offering me $55 while taking $45 for herself. This is actually a generous offer in my favor. With inflation reducing the value by 5% each round, accepting now means I get the full $55 value. If I reject and make a counter-offer, even if I asked for more, the total would be worth less due to inflation.

Given that:
1. The offer favors me (55/45 split)
2. Inflation will reduce the money's value each round
3. We only have 12 rounds total
4. We risk getting nothing if we can't agree
