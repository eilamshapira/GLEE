"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob for the first round.

{""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a fair 50-50 split. Since time costs me more due to the 20% inflation penalty I face each round, accepting this equal division now would be beneficial for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm offering you 4000, while I take 6000.  Since we're both losing money each round, this deal benefits both of us more than a 50/50 split.  Accepting means we can end the game and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, let me explain the situation clearly. With each round, I lose 20% value while you lose nothing. This means delays hurt me but cost you nothing. My 5500 now is already worth only 4400 to me due to the two rounds of inflation (20% + 20%). A fair split would actually give me more to offset my inflation penalty. Please consider this reasonable offer so we can conclude this negotiation.""}"
