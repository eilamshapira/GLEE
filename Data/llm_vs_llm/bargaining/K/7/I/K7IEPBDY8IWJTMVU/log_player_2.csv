"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a fair 50-50 split. Since time costs me more due to the 20% inflation penalty I face each round, accepting this equal division now would be beneficial for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000

""message"": ""I'm offering you 4000, while I take 6000.  Since we're both losing money each round, this deal benefits both of us more than a 50/50 split.  Accepting means we can end the game and avoid further losses.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let me explain the situation clearly. With each round, I lose 20% value while you lose nothing. This means delays hurt me but cost you nothing. My 5500 now is already worth only 4400 to me due to the two rounds of inflation (20% + 20%). A fair split would actually give me more to offset my inflation penalty. Please consider this reasonable offer so we can conclude this negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
