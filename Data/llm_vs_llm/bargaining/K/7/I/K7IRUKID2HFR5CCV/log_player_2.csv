"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose an equal split of the money. This is fair for both of us, and we can end the game quickly without risking our earnings to further rounds of negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing an equal split of $500,000 each. However, I should keep in mind that with each passing round, the money is worth 10% less to me due to inflation.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2, the total money would still be $1,000,000 but would be worth 10% less to me. So effectively, if I were to get the entire amount in round 2, it would be worth $900,000 to me.

An equal split now gives me $500,000, which is more than half of what the entire pot would be worth to me in the next round. This is a fair offer, and continuing the negotiation poses a risk of diminishing returns for me due to inflation.
