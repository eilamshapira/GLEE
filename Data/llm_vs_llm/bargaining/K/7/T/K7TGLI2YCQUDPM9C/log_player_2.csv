"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a counter-offer in the next round. 100,000$ is too low for me, especially considering Alice is taking 90% of the total amount. Even with 10% inflation, I can still propose a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I propose a more equitable split, where I get $550,000 and Alice gets $450,000. This is a fair offer that gives me a reasonable share while still leaving Alice with a substantial amount. Since Alice isn't affected by inflation but I am, it's important for me to secure a good deal now, as any future rounds will reduce the real value of my share by 10%."
