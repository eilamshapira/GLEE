"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a slightly favorable split for myself, considering inflation might affect future rounds. I'll offer a 60-40 split to start negotiations.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'd like to accompany this offer with: ""I propose a 60-40 split, which is fair considering the time value of money."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 47 
# Bob gain: 53 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Due to 10% inflation, if I accept this offer of $47, it's actually worth $42.30 to me (47 * 0.9)
2. If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount I get will be worth 20% less due to inflation
3. My previous offer of $60 was rejected, so Bob is unlikely to accept a similar high offer in the next round
4. $42.30 is better than risking further inflation and potential lower offers
