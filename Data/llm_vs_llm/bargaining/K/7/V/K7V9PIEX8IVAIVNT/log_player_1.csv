"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a slightly favorable split for me, but fair enough that Bob might accept to avoid losing value through inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

Let me explain to Bob: I propose I get $5,500 and you get $4,500. This is a reasonable split, and if you reject it, we'll both lose 10% of the total value in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4737 
# Bob gain: 5263 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Bob's offer would give me $4,737, which due to the 10% inflation is actually worth $4,263.30 in original value.
If I reject, we go to another round where I can make an offer, but everything will be worth another 10% less.

Even though this split favors Bob slightly, the inflation penalty makes accepting the better choice. If I reject, I'd need to secure a significantly better deal in the next round just to break even, which might be difficult.
