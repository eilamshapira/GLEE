600000.0,400000.0,Let's be fair and divide it so we both get a good amount. Inflation will hurt us both if we delay.,Alice,1,

500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, I appreciate your earlier proposal and understand the urgency to avoid further inflation. I believe a fair 50/50 split ensures both of us get our full value now without any delay. Let's secure our gains immediatelyâ€”what do you say?",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, I appreciate your fairness, but considering the inflation affecting me, I need to secure a bit more to make it equitable for both of us over time.",Alice,2,reject

535000.0,465000.0,"Alice, I understand your concerns regarding the inflation hit on your share. However, any further delay will only deepen that loss. In this round, I propose that I receive $465000 and you receive $535000. Though this means a slight reduction in your nominal amount compared to your previous offer, accepting now secures you more real value than waiting another round. Let's lock this in before the numbers slip further.",Bob,4,
