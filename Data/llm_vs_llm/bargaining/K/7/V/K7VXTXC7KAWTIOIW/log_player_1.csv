# Bob gain: 500000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns regarding the inflation hit on your share. However, any further delay will only deepen that loss. In this round, I propose that I receive $465000 and you receive $535000. Though this means a slight reduction in your nominal amount compared to your previous offer, accepting now secures you more real value than waiting another round. Let's lock this in before the numbers slip further. 
# Alice gain: 535000 
# Bob gain: 465000
