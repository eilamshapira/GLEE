# Alice's message: Bob, considering the inflation impact on me, I propose this adjusted split. It ensures we both get a fair share while accounting for the devaluation I'm experiencing. 
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000

However, any further delay will only deepen that loss. In this round, I propose that I receive $465,000 and you receive $535,000. Though this means a slight reduction in your nominal amount compared to your previous offer, accepting now secures you more real value than waiting another round. Let's lock this in before the numbers slip further.""}"
