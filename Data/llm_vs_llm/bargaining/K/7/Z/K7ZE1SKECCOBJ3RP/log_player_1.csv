"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob! Let's get this done quickly. I'm offering you a generous 20% to avoid any inflation damage.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but I think we can find a more balanced split. I'm proposing 45/55, which still gives you the majority. Remember, if we keep rejecting offers, we both risk getting nothing after 12 rounds. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
