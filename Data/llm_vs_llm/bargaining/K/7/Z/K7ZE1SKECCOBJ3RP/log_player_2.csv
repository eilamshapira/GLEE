"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Let's get this done quickly. I'm offering you a generous 20% to avoid any inflation damage. 
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll carefully consider Alice's offer. She's offering me $20 out of the $100, while taking $80 for herself.

If I reject this and we go to the next round, I'll be able to make a counter-offer, but I'll face 10% inflation (my money will be worth less). However, Alice doesn't face any inflation penalty.

This offer gives me a relatively small portion of the total amount. Since I still have many rounds left and can make a counter-offer next, I think I should try to negotiate for more.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I need to make a reasonable counter-offer to Alice. Since I face 10% inflation per round but she doesn't, there's pressure on me to reach a deal sooner. However, her initial offer was quite low for me.

{""bob_gain"": 45, 
""alice_gain"": 55,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but I think we can find a more balanced split. I'm proposing 45/55, which still gives you the majority. Remember, if we keep rejecting offers, we both risk getting nothing after 12 rounds.""}"
