"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the 10% depreciation you face each round, $40 now is better than waiting for a potentially better offer that would be worth less to you. This is a fair offer given our different inflation rates. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
