"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's start with a fair split that acknowledges the inflation I'm facing. 55 for me, 45 for you. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Since Alice faces 10% depreciation per round and I face no depreciation:
- If I reject now and propose next round, Alice's $55 would only be worth $49.50 to her
- This gives me negotiating leverage in the next round
- I could propose a more favorable split for myself

Given this dynamic, it makes sense to reject this initial offer and make a counter-proposal where I get a larger share.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice faces 10% depreciation per round while I don't, I can propose a split that gives me more while still being acceptable to Alice, as waiting would cost her more.

Her $55 from last round would only be worth $49.50 to her now. If she rejects my offer, in the next round any amount would be worth even less to her (another 10% decrease).

I'll propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which is still better for her than waiting another round.
