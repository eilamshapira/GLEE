"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if this offer is fair. Alice is proposing I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000. While not an even split, it's not terribly unfair. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer, but we'll lose 10% of the total value, meaning we'd be dividing $9,000 in the next round.

Given the diminishing value, I should carefully consider whether to accept now or try for a better deal with less total money.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more balanced counter-offer while acknowledging the decreasing value from inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an even 50-50 split, which gives us both $5,000. This is a fair division that maximizes our collective benefit. Since we've already lost 10% of the value due to inflation, accepting this balanced offer now would be in both our interests rather than continuing to negotiate with further decreasing returns."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this carefully. Alice has improved her offer from the first round, now offering me $4,500 instead of $4,000, with her taking $5,500. 

We've already gone through 2 rounds, and the money has lost 19% of its value since the beginning. If I reject again, we'll lose even more value to inflation in the next round.

While I could counter with another offer, the diminishing returns suggest we should come to an agreement soon. Alice has moved toward a more balanced split, and $4,500 is a reasonable amount.
