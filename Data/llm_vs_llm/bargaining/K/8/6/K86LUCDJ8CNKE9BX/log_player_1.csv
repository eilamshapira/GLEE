"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making an offer that considers both the inflation factor and a fair division.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

Since I face a 20% devaluation each round while Bob doesn't, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This accounts for the time pressure I face and still gives Bob a substantial portion. If we go to the next round, the total value will be worth less to me, so it's beneficial for both of us to reach an agreement now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to make a more strategic offer considering the inflation pressure I'm facing.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split. Since we're now in round 3, my money is worth 36% less than in round 1 due to compounding inflation (20% each round). If we continue to the next round, I'll face even greater devaluation. This offer gives Bob a better deal than my initial proposal while still accounting for the disadvantage I face from inflation. Let's reach an agreement now to avoid further losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
