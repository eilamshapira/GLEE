"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you can still make a good profit.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think a 55-45 split is more fair.  It's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a bit more for my efforts.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Due to 5% inflation, my $45 is actually worth $42.75 now
2. If I reject, I can make another offer, but the money will be worth even less in the next round
3. Bob's offer is reasonable, and the inflation penalty means delaying could hurt me more
4. We still have many rounds, but getting a decent amount now might be better than risking further devaluation
