"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer that's fair but slightly advantageous to me.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because it's reasonably balanced while giving me a slight advantage as the first mover. If Bob rejects this offer, we'll move to the next round where the total amount will decrease by 5% to $950,000, which means we'd both potentially get less."
