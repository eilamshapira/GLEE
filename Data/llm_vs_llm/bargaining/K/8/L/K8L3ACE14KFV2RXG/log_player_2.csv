"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. I'm being offered $450,000 out of $1,000,000
2. This is a 45-55 split, slightly in Alice's favor
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer, but the total value will decrease by 5%
4. The next round would involve $950,000 total
5. While I could try to negotiate for more, the risk of losing value might not be worth it
6. $450,000 is a substantial amount and fairly close to an even split

Given that the money will lose 5% of its value if I reject, and the current offer is reasonably fair (though slightly in Alice's favor), I'll accept this offer.
