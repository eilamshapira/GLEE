"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a fair offer from Alice, where we split the $100 equally. Since this is the first round, the full value is still available. If I reject, I'll get to make an offer next round, but the total will be worth 10% less (only $90 total), which means even if I tried to get more, it would be from a smaller pot.
