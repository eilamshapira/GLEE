"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6897, ""bob_gain"": 3103, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'd like to settle this now. Considering how waiting hurts both of us – especially you with a 10% loss per round – I propose that I get $6897 and you get $3103. This split reflects our differing discounts and ensures you don't lose additional value by delaying. Looking forward to your acceptance so we can both secure our best possible outcomes.""}"
