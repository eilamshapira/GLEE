"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here’s my proposal: I’ll receive $357142 and you’ll get $642858. This split reflects our future bargaining power (with my money depreciating 20% per round and yours 10%), so accepting now avoids further loss. I believe this is fair—let’s agree and wrap it up! 
# Bob gain: 642858 
# Alice gain: 357142 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Current offer: I get $642,858, Alice gets $357,142
2. If I reject:
   * The total value will depreciate
   * My money will be worth 10% less
   * Alice's money will be worth 20% less
   * I'll get to make the next proposal

The offer Alice made is actually quite close to the optimal split considering our different depreciation rates. If I reject:
* My $642,858 would be worth $578,572 next round
* Alice's $357,142 would be worth $285,714 next round

Given that:
1. The offer is mathematically fair considering our depreciation rates
2. Rejecting would lead to both of us losing value
3. I'm getting the larger share (64.3%)
