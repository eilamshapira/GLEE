"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
- Alice is proposing I get $400,000 while she gets $600,000
- This is clearly not an even split
- Since I get to make the next offer if I reject, I can propose a more favorable split
- There's a strategic advantage in rejecting this uneven split

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split while being strategic:

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I propose a more balanced split. While slightly in my favor, it's fairer than your 60-40 proposal.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meeting in the middle 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this new offer:
- Alice has moved significantly from her initial 60-40 split
- The current offer is very close to 50-50 (47.5% - 52.5%)
- If I reject, we'll lose another round, and back-and-forth negotiation might not yield much better results
- This is a reasonable compromise that's close to fair
- The difference ($50,000) may not be worth the risk of further negotiation
