"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to think about this carefully. 

Alice is offering a 50-50 split, which is $50 for each of us. This appears fair at first glance.

However, I should consider the inflation aspect. If I reject and we go to another round:
- For me, the money doesn't lose value (0% inflation)
- For Alice, the money loses 10% value

This means in the next round, I could propose a split that seems better to me but might still be acceptable to Alice due to her inflation penalty. If I make an offer like $60 for me and $40 for Alice in the next round, that $40 would be worth only $36 to her (after 10% inflation).

I'll reject this first offer to make a counter-proposal that should still be acceptable to Alice given her inflation constraint.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'd like to offer $45 to Alice and keep $55 for myself. This is a reasonable adjustment considering that in this round, Alice experiences 10% inflation on the money's value."
