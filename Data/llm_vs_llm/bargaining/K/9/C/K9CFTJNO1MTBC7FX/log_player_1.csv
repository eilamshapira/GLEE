"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn, a bit more balanced! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is still worth the same, but Bob's offer gives him more than I proposed in Round 1, and considering the inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll think carefully about this.

For me, $4500 is a bit less than I initially proposed ($6000), but it's still a significant amount. However, I should also consider that if I reject this offer, the money will be worth even less to Bob in the next round, which could give me an advantage.

My decision:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was rejected, it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, the money Bob gains is now worth 20% less than the original amount (10% less in Round 1 + 10% less in Round 2).

I'll make a new offer, taking into account the decreasing value of the money for Bob:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500,
  ""message"": ""Inflation is on my side, let's be reasonable!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Split it evenly, before inflation eats more! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","An even split! Considering the inflation, Bob's gain is now worth 27.1% less than the original amount, which means he's effectively getting $3659 (5000 * (1 - 0.271)) in value, while I would get the full $5000.

Given this, an even split is actually favorable to me. I should accept this offer, as it gives me a better deal than what I would get if I were to reject it and make another offer in the next round.

My decision:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
