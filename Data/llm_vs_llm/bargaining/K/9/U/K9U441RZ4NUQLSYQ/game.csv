55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $55 and you receive $45. Accepting this offer today avoids further losses from inflation—while my share would drop by 20% in the next round, yours would only drop by 5%, making delays less attractive for me. I think this is a fair and efficient way to settle. What do you say?",Alice,1,

16.67,83.33,"Alice, I appreciate your earlier proposal. In round 2, I can do better by settling now. If you wait until your turn in round 3, you'll face a further 20% discount, leaving you with roughly $16.67 in value. To avoid that loss, I propose that I receive $83.33 and you receive $16.67 today. I believe this is a fair deal given the discounting effects—let's conclude this game efficiently.",Bob,2,

20.88,79.12,"Hi Bob, in round 3 the discounting is starting to bite even more. To ensure you get at least what you’d expect if you waited to propose in the next round, I’m offering you $79.12 while I take $20.88. This division matches your continuation value (since if you reject, as proposer in round 4 you'd secure roughly the same effective benefit after your 5% discount) and it spares both of us further losses. I believe this is a fair proposal given the inflation effects. What do you say?",Alice,3,
