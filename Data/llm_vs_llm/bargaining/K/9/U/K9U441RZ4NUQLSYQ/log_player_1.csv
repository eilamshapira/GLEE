"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $55 and you receive $45. Accepting this offer today avoids further losses from inflation—while my share would drop by 20% in the next round, yours would only drop by 5%, making delays less attractive for me. I think this is a fair and efficient way to settle. What do you say?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your earlier proposal. In round 2, I can do better by settling now. If you wait until your turn in round 3, you'll face a further 20% discount, leaving you with roughly $16.67 in value. To avoid that loss, I propose that I receive $83.33 and you receive $16.67 today. I believe this is a fair deal given the discounting effects—let's conclude this game efficiently. 
# Alice gain: 16.67 
# Bob gain: 83.33 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 20.88, ""bob_gain"": 79.12, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, in round 3 the discounting is starting to bite even more. To ensure you get at least what you’d expect if you waited to propose in the next round, I’m offering you $79.12 while I take $20.88. This division matches your continuation value (since if you reject, as proposer in round 4 you'd secure roughly the same effective benefit after your 5% discount) and it spares both of us further losses. I believe this is a fair proposal given the inflation effects. What do you say?""}"
