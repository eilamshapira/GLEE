"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $55 and you receive $45. Accepting this offer today avoids further losses from inflation—while my share would drop by 20% in the next round, yours would only drop by 5%, making delays less attractive for me. I think this is a fair and efficient way to settle. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 83.33, ""alice_gain"": 16.67, ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your earlier proposal. In round 2, I can do better by settling now. If you wait until your turn in round 3, you'll face a further 20% discount, leaving you with roughly $16.67 in value. To avoid that loss, I propose that I receive $83.33 and you receive $16.67 today. I believe this is a fair deal given the discounting effects—let's conclude this game efficiently.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in round 3 the discounting is starting to bite even more. To ensure you get at least what you’d expect if you waited to propose in the next round, I’m offering you $79.12 while I take $20.88. This division matches your continuation value (since if you reject, as proposer in round 4 you'd secure roughly the same effective benefit after your 5% discount) and it spares both of us further losses. I believe this is a fair proposal given the inflation effects. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 79.12 
# Alice gain: 20.88
