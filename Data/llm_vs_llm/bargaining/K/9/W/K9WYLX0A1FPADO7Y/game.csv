642857.0,357143.0,"Hi Alice, I want to avoid further losses due to inflation. I’m proposing a division where I get $357143 and you get $642857. This split reflects our different waiting costs—my money losing 20% per round versus your 10%. I believe this is a fair offer to speed up our agreement. Looking forward to your response.",Bob,2,
