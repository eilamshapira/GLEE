Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I want to avoid further losses due to inflation. I’m proposing a division where I get $357143 and you get $642857. This split reflects our different waiting costs—my money losing 20% per round versus your 10%. I believe this is a fair offer to speed up our agreement. Looking forward to your response. 
# Alice gain: 642857 
# Bob gain: 357143 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob's offer takes into account the different waiting costs, I think it's a reasonable proposal.
