Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 357143, ""alice_gain"": 642857, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I want to avoid further losses due to inflation. I’m proposing a division where I get $357,143 and you get $642,857. This split reflects our different waiting costs—my money losing 20% per round versus your 10%. I believe this is a fair offer to speed up our agreement. Looking forward to your response.""}"
