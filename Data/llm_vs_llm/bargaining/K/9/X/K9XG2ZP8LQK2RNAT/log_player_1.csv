"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making a proposal. (For transparency—though in a real negotiation I might not reveal the reasoning—here’s a brief summary of the idea behind my offer.)

We are playing an alternating‐offers game with depreciation: each round delayed, the money “shrinks” by 5% for me (Alice) and 10% for Bob. Using backward induction (thinking ahead to what each of us would get if we waited until later rounds), a subgame‑perfect equilibrium can be computed. In such an equilibrium, when I’m proposing in Round 1 the “pie” of $1,000,000 should be split in a way that leaves Bob just as well off accepting now as he would be by waiting and proposing in Round 2. In the calculations that follow (using each player’s discount rate from round to round), the result comes out to roughly an allocation where Bob would need to get about $579,763 (nominal dollars) and I would get about $420,237 in Round 1. (Because Bob’s money depreciates faster when waiting, his “outside option” in Round 2 is lower in present‐value terms than mine, so he must receive a relatively larger share if I propose right now.) 

Thus, my offer in JSON is:

{""alice_gain"": 420237, ""bob_gain"": 579763}

Let the negotiation begin!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Based on the depreciation adjustments, my $400,000 in Round 2 is worth only 95% of that (i.e. $380,000 in Round‑1 value for me). In the earlier equilibrium reasoning I derived for Round 1, I would have aimed for roughly $420,237 (in Round‑1 value) for myself. Since $380,000 is clearly less than what I can secure by waiting and making my own offer (given there’s still time and the structure of the game), I must decline this proposal.

My answer is:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Based on standard alternating‑offers logic (adjusted for the fact that at each round the pie’s worth drops by 5% for me and 10% for Bob), here’s one way to think about it:

At any stage the proposer can “buy” agreement by offering the responder just what he’d get by waiting one extra round (when his own discounting comes into play). In our game the per‐round discount factors are
  δA = 0.95 for me (Alice)  and  δB = 0.90 for Bob.

In equilibrium it turns out that when I’m proposing the following conditions (with fractions of the pie) must hold:
  • Bob must be indifferent between accepting my offer and waiting to propose in the next round. That is, his share today (nominal dollars) must equal what he would get next round as proposer after his extra waiting discount.
  • Similarly, if Bob later became proposer he’d design his offer to make me just indifferent using my discount of 0.95 if I were to wait.

A simple derivation (see, for example, standard treatments of two‐player alternating–offers bargaining) shows that if we denote by x the equilibrium fraction for the proposer (Alice) and (1 – x) for the responder (Bob) then these conditions imply

  x = (1 – δB)⁄(1 – δA·δB)
  and
  1 – x = δB(1 – δA)⁄(1 – δA·δB).

Plugging in δA = 0.95 and δB = 0.90 we get

  x = (1 – 0.90)/(1 – 0.95×0.90) = 0.10/0.145 ≈ 0.68966,
  1 – x = 0.90×(1 – 0.95)/0.145 = (0.90×0.05)/0.145 ≈ 0.31034.

Thus, as the round‑3 proposer (Alice) my equilibrium offer is to take about 68.97% of the pie and to give Bob about 31.03% (nominally).

When applied to $1,000,000 this suggests:

  Alice: 0.68966 × 1,000,000 ≈ $689,655
  Bob:   0.31034 × 1,000,000 ≈ $310,345

So in JSON format my round‑3 offer is:

{""alice_gain"": 689655, ""bob_gain"": 310345}

Let the game continue!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 380000 
# Bob gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let’s compare the value of Bob’s round‑4 offer to my expected continuation value if I reject it.

In round 4, due to inflation the actual present‐value (round‑1 equivalent) multipliers are:
 • For me (Alice): 1 – 0.1426 = 0.8574
 • For Bob: 1 – 0.271 = 0.729

Bob’s offer gives me a nominal 380,000 dollars. In round‑1 terms that is:
 380,000 × 0.8574 ≈ 325,812

If I reject this offer, I’ll be the proposer in round 5. In our setup the per‐round discount factors remain δ_A = 0.95 for me and δ_B = 0.90 for Bob. (Indeed, in round 4 these discount factors have compounded so that my round‑4 multiplier is 0.95³ ≈ 0.8574 and Bob’s is 0.90³ = 0.729; in round 5 my multiplier will be 0.95⁴ ≈ 0.8145, and Bob’s 0.90⁴ ≈ 0.6561.)

From standard alternating‑offers logic (which we applied in round 3), when I am the proposer my equilibrium share (in nominal dollar terms) would be about 68.97% of the pie. In round 5 the nominal pie is still $1,000,000, but its real value to me is reduced by the additional discount:
 My round‑5 payoff (in round‑1 dollars) ≈ 0.95⁴ × 0.68966 × 1,000,000
  ≈ 0.8145 × 689,660
  ≈ 561,730  

Comparing:
 • Accepting Bob’s offer in round 4 gives me about $325,812 (round‑1 value).
 • Rejecting gives me an expectation of roughly $561,730 (round‑1 value) in round 5.

Clearly, 561,730 is much better than 325,812.

Thus, I must decline Bob’s offer.

My answer is:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll now propose a division based on the standard alternating‑offers reasoning with constant per‑round discount factors (for each new proposal the same one‑round discount factors apply: δA = 0.95 for me and δB = 0.90 for Bob). In such reasoning the proposer’s equilibrium share is:

 Proposer share x = (1 – δB) / (1 – δA · δB)
  = (1 – 0.90) / (1 – 0.95 × 0.90)
  = 0.10 / 0.145 ≈ 0.68966

Thus, as the round‑5 proposer, I (Alice) would claim about 68.97% of the pie, leaving Bob about 31.03%. Expressed in nominal dollars that is approximately:

 Alice: 0.68966 × 1,000,000 ≈ $689,655
 Bob:   0.31034 × 1,000,000 ≈ $310,345

So my round‑5 offer in JSON is:

{""alice_gain"": 689655, ""bob_gain"": 310345}

Let the negotiation continue!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 360000 
# Bob gain: 640000 
Do you accept this offer?","If I accept Bob’s round‑6 proposal, I’d receive 360,000 nominal dollars. However, because of inflation my money is now worth only 77.38% of its round‑1 value. That makes the effective value of my share about:

 360,000 × 0.7738 ≈ 278,568

If I reject and move to round 7, I would be in the position to propose a division. Under our standard alternating‑offers equilibrium (with a per‑round discount factor of 0.95 for me and 0.90 for Bob), as proposer I can secure roughly 68.97% of the pie in nominal dollars. Even though the pie will be discounted further (with my round‑7 multiplier being 0.95⁶ ≈ 0.7351), my expected effective value would be approximately:

 0.68966 × 1,000,000 × 0.7351 ≈ 689,660 × 0.7351 ≈ 507,000

Clearly, 507,000 (round‑1 equivalent) is much higher than 278,568.

Thus, I must reject Bob's offer.

My answer is:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 7 I’m the proposer. In our alternating‑offers bargaining problem (with per‑round discount factors of δA = 0.95 for me and δB = 0.90 for Bob), the idea is to offer Bob just enough so that he’s indifferent between accepting right now and waiting to propose in round 8. (In every round when the “pie” is $1,000,000 in nominal dollars, the equilibrium “nominal” split by backward‐induction turns out to be the same—in this case about 68.97% for the proposer and 31.03% for the responder—even though the effective (present‑value) payouts are discounted further as rounds pass.) 

Thus, following that reasoning, my round‑7 offer is to take roughly 68.97% of $1,000,000 and give Bob about 31.03%. In dollars that amounts to approximately

 Alice: 0.68966 × 1,000,000 ≈ $689,655  
 Bob:  0.31034 × 1,000,000 ≈ $310,345

I now send my round‑7 proposal in the required JSON format:

{""alice_gain"": 689655, ""bob_gain"": 310345}

Let the negotiation continue!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's round‑8 offer gives me a nominal $450,000, but due to inflation my money is now worth only about 69.83% of its round‑1 value. In round‑1 terms that is roughly

 450,000 × 0.6983 ≈ 314,235.

If I reject this offer, I become the proposer in round 9. Using our standard equilibrium reasoning with discount factors δA = 0.95 and δB = 0.90, as proposer I can secure about 68.97% of the pie nominally. However, in round 9 my money is further discounted (by 0.95⁸ ≈ 0.6634). My expected effective payoff in round 9 would then be approximately

 0.68966 × 1,000,000 × 0.6634 ≈ 458,000

in round‑1 value.

Since 458,000 greatly exceeds 314,235, I reject Bob’s offer.

My answer is:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 9 I am the proposer. To determine my offer I rely on the equilibrium reasoning we’ve been applying—with the one‐round discount factors remaining δA = 0.95 for me and δB = 0.90 for Bob. In that framework the equilibrium prescription is to offer the responder just enough so that he is indifferent between accepting now or waiting to propose in the next round. This reasoning yields for the proposer an equilibrium nominal share of

  x = (1 – δB) / (1 – δA · δB)
    = (1 – 0.90) / (1 – 0.95 × 0.90)
    = 0.10 / 0.145 ≈ 0.68966

That is, as proposer I would take about 68.97% of the $1,000,000, leaving Bob about 31.03%.

Thus, my round‑9 offer is approximately:

 Alice: $689,655  
 Bob:  $310,345

I now send my round‑9 proposal in JSON format:

{""alice_gain"": 689655, ""bob_gain"": 310345}

Let the negotiation continue!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer in round 10 gives me a nominal $500,000. However, due to inflation my money in round 10 is worth only 63.02% of its round‑1 value, so in round‑1 terms I get about:

 500,000 × 0.6302 ≈ 315,100

If I reject and move to round 11, I will be the proposer. Under our equilibrium reasoning, as the proposer I can secure about 68.97% of the $1,000,000 nominally. In round 11 (one more round of 5% discount relative to round 1), the multiplier for me will be 0.95¹⁰ ≈ 0.5987. That yields an expected round‑11 value of:

 0.68966 × 1,000,000 × 0.5987 ≈ 689,660 × 0.5987 ≈ 413,000

Clearly, 413,000 (in round‑1 value) is much higher than 315,100.

Thus, I reject Bob’s round‑10 offer.

My answer is:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","At this stage the game’s backward‐induction logic forces a very steep allocation when I propose. Here’s the reasoning:

• In round 11 I am the proposer. If Bob rejects my proposal, we move to round 12—the final round—in which Bob will propose. In that final round Bob can allocate nearly the entire pie to himself knowing that if Alice rejects she gets nothing. 

• Let’s denote by xB the nominal dollars Bob would receive in round 11 if he accepts. In round 11 the effective (round‑1) value of a dollar for Bob is given by his discount multiplier: δB^(10) ≈ 0.9¹⁰ ≈ 0.34868. Thus, Bob’s effective payoff from receiving xB in round 11 is xB × 0.34868.

• On the other hand, if Bob rejects in round 11, then in round 12 he becomes the proposer. In round 12 his discount multiplier falls further to δB^(11) ≈ 0.9¹¹ ≈ 0.31381, and he can secure nearly the entire $1,000,000. That gives him an effective (round‑1) payoff of roughly 1,000,000 × 0.31381 ≈ 313,810.

To make Bob just indifferent between accepting in round 11 and waiting until round 12, we must have:
  xB × 0.34868 = 313,810
Solving for xB:
  xB = 313,810 / 0.34868 ≈ 900,000

Thus, to secure Bob’s acceptance in round 11, I must offer him a nominal share of about $900,000. That leaves me with $100,000 nominal.

So my round 11 proposal is:

{""alice_gain"": 100000, ""bob_gain"": 900000}

This is the offer I send in round 11."
