"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it 55-45 in my favor. It's my turn to propose, and a fair compromise considering the loss of value with each round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While it's slightly in Bob's favor, the 20% inflation penalty means further negotiations would reduce the total value significantly. Getting $45 now is better than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds."
