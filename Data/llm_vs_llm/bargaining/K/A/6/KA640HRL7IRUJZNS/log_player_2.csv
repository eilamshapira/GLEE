"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer. She's proposing that I get $40 while she gets $60. This isn't an equal split, but it's also not terribly unfair. I need to decide if I should accept this or make a counter-offer.

Since we have 12 rounds total, I have plenty of opportunities to negotiate. I'll reject this initial offer to see if we can reach a more equitable distribution.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a more balanced split while still acknowledging that Alice made a reasonable first offer.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I suggest we split the money equally. A 50-50 division is fair to both of us and allows us to conclude the negotiation amicably."
