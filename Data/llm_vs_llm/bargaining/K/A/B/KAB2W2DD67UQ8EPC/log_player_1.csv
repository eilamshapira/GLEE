Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money more evenly.  I propose 55 for me and 45 for you.  This is a more balanced division, and we still have time to negotiate before the inflation hurts us both. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer since even with 10% inflation impact on my side, I can still make a better counter-offer in the next round. The 45-55 split in Bob's favor is less favorable than my initial proposal, and I believe we can find a better middle ground."
