"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to conclude this quickly to avoid inflation losses. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if Alice's offer is reasonable given the inflation penalty I face.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total money will effectively be worth 8,000$ to me (due to 20% inflation). Even if I proposed a very favorable split for myself in the next round, Alice might reject it, leading to further rounds and more inflation.

The current offer gives me 4,000$ immediately, which is better than risking further depreciation. Since I don't know how inflation affects Alice, she might be more willing to wait if her inflation rate is lower than mine.
