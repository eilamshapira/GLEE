"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's keep this simple, Bob. I'll take the lion's share, and you still get a decent chunk. It's a win-win! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $100,000 while keeping $900,000 for herself
2. If I reject, we move to next round where:
   * My money will be worth 10% less
   * Her money will be worth 5% less
   * I get to make the next proposal

This is a very uneven split (90-10) in Alice's favor. Since the depreciation rates are different (10% vs 5%), and I get to make the next proposal, I believe I can get a better deal by rejecting this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer, considering that Alice faces a 5% depreciation if she rejects:

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is a fair split that gives us both a substantial amount. If you reject, your share will be worth 5% less next round, while better splits will be hard to achieve. Let's conclude this reasonably.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Alright Bob, let's try a truly fair split this time. 50/50. Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering a 50-50 split ($500,000 each)
2. Due to inflation:
   * My $500,000 is actually worth $405,000 (19% less)
   * Her $500,000 is worth $451,250 (9.75% less)
3. If I reject:
   * Next round my money will be worth 29% less
   * Her money will be worth 14.75% less
   * I get to make the proposal

While this appears to be a fair 50-50 split, the different inflation rates mean I'm actually getting less real value. However, if I reject, the further inflation will hurt me more than it hurts Alice. The difference in our inflation rates (10% vs 5% per round) means my negotiating position gets worse each round.

Given this dynamic, I should accept now before the value deteriorates further.
