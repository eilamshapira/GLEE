"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm trying to find a balance between maximizing my potential gain and securing a deal before inflation eats away too much of my share.  I hope Bob sees this as a fair offer."
