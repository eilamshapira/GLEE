Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"":60,""bob_gain"":40,""message"":""Let's start with a fair split. You get 40, I get 60.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Consider that if you reject this, we'll move to round 3 where your money will be worth 20% less due to inflation. This offer gives you more value now than a potentially better split would give you later. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
