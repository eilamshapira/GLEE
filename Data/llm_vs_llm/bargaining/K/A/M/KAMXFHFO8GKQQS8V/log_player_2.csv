"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. You get 40, I get 60. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Alice's offer of a 40-60 split in my favor. While I gain $40, I need to analyze whether this is the best outcome.

Since I face no inflation (money worth 0% less each round), while Alice faces 20% inflation per round, I have a strategic advantage in later rounds. If I reject and make a counter-offer, Alice's share will be worth less to her in the next round.

This suggests I might get a better deal by rejecting and making my own proposal in round 2.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since I'm not affected by inflation but Alice loses 20% value each round, I should propose a deal that accounts for this asymmetry while still being reasonable enough for Alice to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 60,

""message"": ""Alice, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Consider that if you reject this, we'll move to round 3 where your money will be worth 20% less due to inflation. This offer gives you more value now than a potentially better split would give you later.""}"
