"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a fair offer that gives both of us substantial amounts while acknowledging the inflation pressure I face.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, as I'm facing 5% inflation per round and need to secure a good deal relatively early. This still gives you a substantial $400,000 while allowing me to address my inflation concerns."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I see that Bob is also facing inflation, and it's even higher at 20% per round compared to my 5%. This explains why he's pushing for a larger share. Let me make a more balanced offer considering our different inflation rates.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose an equal 50-50 split. With your higher inflation rate of 20% per round, delaying further would cost you more than it costs me. This fair split gives us both substantial amounts and prevents further value erosion from inflation for both of us."
