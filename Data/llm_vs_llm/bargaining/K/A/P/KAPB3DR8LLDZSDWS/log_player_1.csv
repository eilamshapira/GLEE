"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make my offer for dividing the $100. Since this is the first round and I need to consider the 10% inflation per round that affects me, I'll propose a fair division while keeping in mind that delay would cost me.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

This is a fair, equal split of the money. I propose we each take $50, which is an equitable division that respects both our interests. Since inflation will reduce the value of my share by 10% each round, it makes sense to agree on a reasonable split now rather than prolonging negotiations."
