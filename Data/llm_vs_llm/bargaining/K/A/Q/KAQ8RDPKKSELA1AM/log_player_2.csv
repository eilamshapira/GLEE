"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and end this quickly 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $45 while taking $55
2. While not perfectly equal, it's a reasonable first offer
3. If I reject, the money will be worth 5% less next round ($95 total)
4. Even if I counter with a better offer next round, we risk further devaluation
5. The difference of $10 might not be worth the risk of losing value

I think it's best to accept this offer. It's fairly reasonable, and the risk of losing value through inflation outweighs the potential gain from negotiating.
