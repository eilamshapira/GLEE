Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, Alice. It's fair and we both walk away with a good deal. Consider the impact of inflation on me if you decline.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this offer is still generous considering inflation is working against you. Don't let greed get the best of us. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, I need to compensate for the inflation. This is still a good deal for you, and we can both walk away happy.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but I need you to meet me halfway. This offer is still good for you considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

However, I feel that we could have come to a more balanced agreement earlier if Alice had considered the impact of inflation on my share. I accept this offer because the risk of getting nothing is higher than the reward of trying to get the bigger share."
