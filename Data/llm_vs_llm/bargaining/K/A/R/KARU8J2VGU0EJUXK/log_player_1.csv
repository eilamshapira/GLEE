"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair initial offer, considering that inflation will reduce the value by 20% each round if we don't reach an agreement. A fair split would give us both a good amount while encouraging quick acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

This is a reasonable offer where I get a slightly higher amount to account for the inflation risk I face, but Bob still gets a substantial portion. I'm proposing this split to encourage a quick agreement and avoid value loss from inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
- If I accept now, I'll get $4000, but due to 20% inflation, it's actually worth $3200 to me
- If I reject and we continue, any future gains will be worth even less due to compounding inflation
- Bob seems to be trying to take advantage of our different inflation rates
- However, if I reject, the next round I can make an offer but the money will be worth even less to me

While this offer isn't great, the inflation penalty is significant and waiting longer will only reduce my purchasing power further. Making a new offer might not lead to a better outcome given the inflation pressure.
