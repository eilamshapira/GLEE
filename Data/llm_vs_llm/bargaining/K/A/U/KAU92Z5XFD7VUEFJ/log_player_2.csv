"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is extremely unfair, giving me only $1 out of $1,000,000. Even with the 10% inflation risk per round, it's worth making a counter-offer to seek a more equitable distribution."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a reasonable offer that gives both parties a substantial amount while accounting for the fact that I'm facing inflation pressure in future rounds. It's much more equitable than Alice's initial extremely unfair offer, and should give her good incentive to accept rather than risk further inflation effects."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. Here's why:
1. With 19% inflation for me, the $400,000 is actually worth $324,000 in round 1 terms
2. If I reject, the next round will have 29% inflation for me, making any future gains worth even less
3. While this isn't as good as my previous proposal, it's still a reasonable split considering the circumstances
4. Alice has moved significantly from her initial unfair offer of $1, showing good faith negotiation
5. Continuing to negotiate might lead to worse outcomes due to increasing inflation on my side"
