Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is ticking and that money is shrinking.  My offer is still generous, but I can't go much lower. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

I need to push Alice a bit more. While the deal is getting worse due to inflation, accepting a lower amount now might make her think I'm desperate.  There's still time for a better agreement."

Round 4

{
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""Alice, this seems like a fair compromise. We both need to be realistic about the shrinking pot.  Let's close this deal and come out ahead.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but this back and forth is costing us both money.  Meet me in the middle here. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This offer is barely better than my last, but the inflation is eating into the pot significantly. Accepting now is better than risking a worse offer later or getting nothing at all."
