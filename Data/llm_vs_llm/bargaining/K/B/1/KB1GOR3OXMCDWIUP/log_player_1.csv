"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer that accounts for the different inflation rates while being fair.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you $4,500 which is close to 50-50. Since inflation affects me more severely (20% vs your 5%), this split acknowledges our different positions while still being quite fair. If we continue to future rounds, we'll both lose value due to inflation.""
