"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you $4500 which is close to 50-50. Since inflation affects me more severely (20% vs your 5%), this split acknowledges our different positions while still being quite fair. If we continue to future rounds, we'll both lose value due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I should carefully consider Alice's offer. She's offering me $4500 of the $10,000, leaving her with $5500.

She makes a valid point about inflation - if I reject, my money is worth 5% less next round, while hers is worth 20% less. This actually gives me some negotiating leverage in future rounds, as delaying hurts her more than me.

If we go to round 2, the $10,000 would be worth $9,500 to me and only $8,000 to Alice. This suggests I might be able to get a better deal by making a counter-offer.

However, Alice's initial offer of $4500 is quite reasonable - it's close to 50-50. Given that we could both lose value through continued negotiation, I'll accept this offer.
