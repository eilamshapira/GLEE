"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5250 
# Bob gain: 4750 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** It's crucial to remember that the value of the money decreases each round.  I need to be increasingly assertive in gaining a larger share to offset this.
* **Bob's rejection:** Bob rejecting my previous offer suggests he might be aiming for a larger portion than 4750. 
* **Finding middle ground:** This offer is a middle ground between my first offer and his.  It's a strong offer for me, but still gives Bob a reasonable amount considering the declining value."
