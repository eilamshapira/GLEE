Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer, considering the 20% inflation for me and the 5% for Alice.

In Round 2, my share is worth 80% of its face value, and Alice's is worth 95%. I need to account for that when making my offer.

Since the money is worth less to me, I will try to get a larger share to compensate.

Here's the offer in JSON format:
