"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer would give me $400,000 while she takes $600,000. Since this is the first round and I have the opportunity to make a counter-proposal without much inflation impact yet, I'll reject this offer to propose a more equitable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split, taking into account the 5% inflation that has already occurred.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I'm offering an equal 50-50 split of the money. This is the fairest division for both of us, and with inflation already affecting the total value, it makes sense to reach an agreement quickly to maximize what we both receive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has increased her offer to me by $20,000 from her first proposal, but it's still significantly in her favor. The inflation has already reduced the real value by 9.75%. If I reject, we'll move to round 4 with even more inflation.

Let me calculate: $420,000 now is worth more than potentially getting $500,000 in the next round with additional inflation. I should consider accepting this to avoid further value loss.
