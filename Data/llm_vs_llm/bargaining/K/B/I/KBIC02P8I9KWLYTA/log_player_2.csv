"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: A fair start, Bob. Let's split it reasonably. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
- Alice is offering me $45 while taking $55
- If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
- However, due to 5% inflation, $100 will be worth $95 next round for me
- 95% of $100 = $95, so my maximum potential gain next round would be less
- $45 now is better than potentially getting slightly more from a depreciated total
