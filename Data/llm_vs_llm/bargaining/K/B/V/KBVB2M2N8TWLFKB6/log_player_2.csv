"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this... 
$400,000 is a substantial amount, but Alice is trying to take the larger share. Given there are many rounds left and the 20% inflation penalty isn't too severe in early rounds, I think I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more equitable split, but still giving Alice a decent portion to make it appealing.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering Alice a substantial $450,000 while keeping a slightly larger share for myself. This is more balanced than her initial offer, and given the inflation pressure, it would be rational for her to accept this."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this...

After 36% inflation, if I accept this offer:
My actual gain would be: $420,000 * 0.64 = $268,800

This is significantly less than what I could have gotten in round 1 ($400,000). Alice's new offer is only slightly better than her first one, and with inflation eating away at the value, I'm getting a worse deal. However, further delays will lead to even more value loss.

Still, since we have 9 rounds left and the reduction isn't devastating yet, I think I can still get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since we're now dealing with significant inflation effects and Alice has shown she's willing to hold out, I'll make a more compromising offer while still maintaining a fair position.

{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000}

This offer is more balanced than my previous one, giving Alice a very reasonable $480,000 while still maintaining a slight advantage for myself. Given the mounting inflation pressure (the next round will have even more value decay), this should be an attractive offer for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

After 59.04% inflation, if I accept this offer:
My actual gain would be: $440,000 * 0.4096 = $180,224

The situation is getting serious. While Alice's offer still favors her, continuing to reject will lead to even more severe value loss. With each round, we're both losing significant value due to inflation. We've already gone through 5 rounds, and the remaining value is diminishing quickly.

Given that:
1. The real value is rapidly decreasing
2. Alice has shown she's willing to hold out
3. Getting $180,224 is better than risking further devaluation
4. We've already lost more than half the original value
