"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance. However, I should keep inflation in mind - if I reject and we go to the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, I'd have to ask for more than 50% to make up for the 20% inflation I'm experiencing. But then Alice might reject my offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation for me.

Given that this is a fair starting offer and inflation will hurt me in future rounds, I'll accept.
