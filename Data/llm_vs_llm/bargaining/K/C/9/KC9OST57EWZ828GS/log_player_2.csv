"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 49 
# Alice gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me consider Alice's offer. Alice is proposing that I (Bob) get $49 while she gets $51.

Given that there's a 5% inflation penalty for me each round, if I reject and we move to round 2, the $100 would effectively be worth $95 to me. So my maximum potential gain in round 2 would be less than in this round.

While I could counter-offer in the next round, I'd be starting from a position where the total value to me is already reduced. The current offer of $49 is quite fair, nearly a 50-50 split, and the risk of losing value through inflation outweighs the small potential gain from negotiating further.
