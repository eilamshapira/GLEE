"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In this first round, I want to propose a fair split that also acknowledges the inflation factor. Since inflation doesn't affect me but might affect Bob, a balanced approach seems reasonable.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I suggest we split the money equally - $500,000 each. This is a fair division that gives us both substantial value without delay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer since there's no disadvantage to me from inflation, and I can make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I notice that Bob tried to take a larger share despite facing inflation pressure. Let me propose a new division that acknowledges the inflation effect on Bob's side while maintaining fairness.

{""alice_gain"": 480000, ""bob_gain"": 520000}

I'm offering you a slightly higher amount ($520,000) to compensate for the inflation effect you're experiencing, while I take $480,000. This is a fair compromise that recognizes your inflation constraint while still giving me a reasonable share."
