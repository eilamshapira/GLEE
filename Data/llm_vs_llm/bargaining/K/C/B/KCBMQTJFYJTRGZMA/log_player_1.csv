"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to consider the dwindling value of the money for me each round due to inflation. To maximize my potential gain while also making the offer appealing enough for Bob to accept, I'll propose the following:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **My Perspective:** I'm prioritizing securing a larger portion of the money early on, as its value diminishes rapidly for me. 600,000$ now is worth much more than a smaller share later.
*   **Bob's Perspective:** 400,000$ is still a significant amount and a good starting point for negotiation. I hope Bob will find this acceptable rather than risk further rounds with potentially smaller gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is completely unacceptable. 10,000$, even with the 20% inflation hit to my perceived value, is far too little. I'm confident I can negotiate a much better deal by making a counter-offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I need to make a reasonable offer considering the inflation is hurting me, but I don't know how inflation effects Bob. I'll try to make this a bit more appealing while still prioritizing my gains.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **Compromise:** I'm reducing my share slightly from my initial offer, hoping this will be seen as a genuine attempt to meet Bob in the middle.
*   **Inflation Consideration:** My gain is now effectively worth even less to me (20% less than in round 1, or effectively 40% less than the original value). This offer reflects my awareness of this decreasing value.
*   **Bob's Incentive:** 450,000$ is a substantial sum for Bob. Given the limited rounds, he should be incentivized to accept this offer.

I hope this shows a willingness to negotiate and secures a reasonable return for me before inflation further erodes my potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 999999 
# Bob gain: 1 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is clearly a troll offer and completely unacceptable. Bob is not negotiating in good faith. Accepting 0.0001% of the money is absurd. I will continue to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, Bob's offers are...unhelpful. I need to make a significant adjustment to my strategy. I'm going to propose something that *strongly* incentivizes acceptance, even if it means a slightly lower personal gain. Inflation is really starting to bite for me.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 510000,
  ""bob_gain"": 490000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **Desperation:** My perceived value is dwindling quickly (48.8% less than round 1).
*   **Strong Incentive:** 490,000$ is a very attractive offer for Bob. It's *almost* a 50/50 split and significantly more generous than his previous offers.
*   **Risk Mitigation:** I'm prioritizing securing something now rather than risking further rounds where my inflation adjusted value will be even lower.

I truly hope Bob sees this as a genuine and fair offer and accepts. Continuing this game will very likely result in a bad outcome for me."
