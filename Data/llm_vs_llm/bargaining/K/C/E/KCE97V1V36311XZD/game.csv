55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob! I'm proposing a slightly higher share for myself because I face a 5% inflation penalty each round. If we go to the next round, we both lose value - you'd need to offer me more to compensate for my inflation loss, and we'd both end up with less overall. This is a fair deal considering the circumstances.",Alice,1,

40.0,60.0,"I rejected your offer because I believe I deserve a larger share. Since I don't know your inflation rate, I'm taking a chance. If you reject this, the value will decrease for me, so let's end this quickly.",Bob,2,

52.0,48.0,"Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but I need to account for my 5% inflation penalty per round. We're now in round 3, and I've already lost about 10% of my purchasing power. This offer is fair - you get almost half, and we both avoid further devaluation. If we continue to the next round, we both lose more value. Let's conclude this reasonably.",Alice,3,
