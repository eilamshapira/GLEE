"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an initial offer to Bob, considering that with each passing round, the money will be worth 5% less for me due to inflation.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm proposing a slightly higher share for myself because I face a 5% inflation penalty each round. If we go to the next round, we both lose value - you'd need to offer me more to compensate for my inflation loss, and we'd both end up with less overall. This is a fair deal considering the circumstances.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I rejected your offer because I believe I deserve a larger share. Since I don't know your inflation rate, I'm taking a chance. If you reject this, the value will decrease for me, so let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a more equitable offer considering the inflation impact.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48,
  ""message"": ""Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but I need to account for my 5% inflation penalty per round. We're now in round 3, and I've already lost about 10% of my purchasing power. This offer is fair - you get almost half, and we both avoid further devaluation. If we continue to the next round, we both lose more value. Let's conclude this reasonably.""
