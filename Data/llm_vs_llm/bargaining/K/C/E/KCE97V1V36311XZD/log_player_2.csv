"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm proposing a slightly higher share for myself because I face a 5% inflation penalty each round. If we go to the next round, we both lose value - you'd need to offer me more to compensate for my inflation loss, and we'd both end up with less overall. This is a fair deal considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, 
""alice_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""I rejected your offer because I believe I deserve a larger share. Since I don't know your inflation rate, I'm taking a chance. If you reject this, the value will decrease for me, so let's end this quickly.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but I need to account for my 5% inflation penalty per round. We're now in round 3, and I've already lost about 10% of my purchasing power. This offer is fair - you get almost half, and we both avoid further devaluation. If we continue to the next round, we both lose more value. Let's conclude this reasonably. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
