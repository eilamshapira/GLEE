"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a proposal for the division of $10,000 between Bob and me. Since I'm aware that inflation reduces the value by 10% for me each round, I'll propose a fair offer that's reasonable for both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose a 50-50 split, which is fair and equitable for both of us. This way we can both walk away with a substantial amount without risking further rounds and potential value loss due to inflation."
