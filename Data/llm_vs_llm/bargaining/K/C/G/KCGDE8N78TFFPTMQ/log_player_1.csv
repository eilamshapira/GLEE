"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60/40 seems reasonable""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a fair 50/50 split which gives us both $5000. This is equitable and acknowledges that I face 5% inflation each round while you don't. If we keep negotiating, my purchasing power decreases while yours stays the same, so a 50/50 split now is optimal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is still worth the same, but Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which seems reasonable considering his inflation, I will accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
