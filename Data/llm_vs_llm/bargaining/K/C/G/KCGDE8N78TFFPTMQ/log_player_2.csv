"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, 60/40 seems reasonable 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's offer carefully, considering the inflation penalty I face in future rounds.

Alice is offering me $4,000 out of the $10,000, which is 40% of the total.

If I reject and we go to the next round, I'll face a 5% inflation penalty, meaning every dollar will be worth 5% less to me. If I make a counter-offer in round 2, I'd need to factor this in.

Since I have the disadvantage of inflation while Alice doesn't, and we only have 12 rounds total, I should be strategic about when to accept.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I need to make a reasonable counter-offer while considering the 5% inflation penalty I'm facing.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50/50 split which gives us both $5,000. This is equitable and acknowledges that I face 5% inflation each round while you don't. If we keep negotiating, my purchasing power decreases while yours stays the same, so a 50/50 split now is optimal for both of us.""}"
