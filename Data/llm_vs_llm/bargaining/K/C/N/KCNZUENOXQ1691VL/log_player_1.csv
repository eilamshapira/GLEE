"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair initial offer, but considering that inflation will affect my gains in future rounds, I'll propose a slight advantage for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I would explain to Bob: ""I propose a reasonable split where I get $5,500 and you get $4,500. This is close to 50-50 and gives us both a substantial amount. Let's avoid the impact of inflation by agreeing now."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that:
1. This is a better offer for me than my previous proposal ($6000 vs $5500)
2. Even with 5% inflation, I'd get $5700 in real value
3. Continuing to next round would mean another 5% loss
4. We don't know if future rounds will yield better offers
5. We're still early in the game but unnecessary delays risk both of us getting nothing
