"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 42.63 
# Alice gain: 57.37 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether I should accept this offer, I need to consider the potential outcomes of rejecting it and moving to the next round, taking into account the 10% decrease in value due to inflation.

In this round, Alice offers me $42.63, and she would take $57.37.

If I reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, the total amount available would be 10% less due to inflation, making it $90.

However, without knowing the exact offer I could make in the next round or how Alice would respond, it's difficult to calculate the optimal decision precisely. But generally, in such games, the first offer is often accepted if it's not significantly biased towards one player, as the risk of losing value due to inflation can outweigh the potential benefits of negotiating a better split.

Given that Alice's initial offer gives her a larger share but not an overwhelmingly large one, and considering the risk of inflation reducing the total amount in subsequent rounds, I might lean towards accepting this offer to secure a known amount rather than risking a potentially lower amount in future rounds.
