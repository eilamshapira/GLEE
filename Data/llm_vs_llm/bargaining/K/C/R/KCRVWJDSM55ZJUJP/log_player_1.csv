"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since the value of money decreases for you each round, I propose 55% for me and 45% for you. It's a fair adjustment considering the inflation impact on your side. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
