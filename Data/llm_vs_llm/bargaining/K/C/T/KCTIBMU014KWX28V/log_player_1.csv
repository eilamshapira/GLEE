"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair first offer, considering that inflation will affect future rounds. Since we both need to agree, I'll propose a slightly favorable split for Bob to encourage acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 4800, ""bob_gain"": 5200}

This is a reasonable split where Bob gets slightly more than half. I'm offering this deal because I want to reach an agreement quickly, avoiding the 20% inflation penalty on my share in future rounds."
