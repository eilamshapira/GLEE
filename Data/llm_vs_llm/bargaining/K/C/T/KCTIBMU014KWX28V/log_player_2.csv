"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
- She's offering me $5,200 (52%) and taking $4,800 (48%)
- It's a fairly balanced split, slightly in my favor
- Being the first round, I have 11 more chances if needed
- However, there's uncertainty about how inflation affects Alice's position
- Getting a better deal isn't guaranteed in later rounds

While I could try to negotiate for more, this is actually a pretty reasonable offer. I'm getting the slightly better end of a nearly even split, and accepting early avoids any inflation risk.
