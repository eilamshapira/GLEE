"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60/40 seems reasonable""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it equally, it's fair and simple. Next round the money will be worth less for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, I need to consider that when evaluating Bob's offer.

Bob's offer is 5000, but due to inflation, it's worth 10% less to me, so the actual value I'd get is 5000 * 0.9 = 4500.

Considering this, I think I can get a better deal if I wait.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less to me and 20% less to Bob in each round, I'll try to take advantage of that.

In Round 3, the money is worth 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 to me and 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 to Bob.

Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6500, 
""bob_gain"": 3500, 
""message"": ""Considering inflation, this split favors you, Bob. Don't let it slip away""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a bit more risk. This offer is still good for you considering inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of Bob's offer considering inflation.

The money I gain is worth 27.1% less, so the value I'd get is 4500 * (1 - 0.271) = 4500 * 0.729 = 3280.5.

The money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less, but that's his problem, not mine.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is not in my favor, and I can try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 27.1% less to me and 48.8% less to Bob, I'll try to make an offer that takes advantage of this.

Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 7000, 
""bob_gain"": 3000, 
""message"": ""Bob, your losses are mounting, don't let it get worse. This is a reasonable offer considering the inflation""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the risk, but I believe this is still a good deal for you considering inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of Bob's offer considering inflation.

The money I gain is worth 40.95% less, so the value I'd get is 4000 * (1 - 0.4095) = 4000 * 0.5905 = 2362.

The money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less, but that's his problem, not mine.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is not in my favor, and I'd rather try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40.95% less to me and 67.23% less to Bob, I'll try to make an offer that takes advantage of this.
