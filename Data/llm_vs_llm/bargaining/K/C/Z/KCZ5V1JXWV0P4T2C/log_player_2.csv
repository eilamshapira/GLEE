"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it equally, it's fair and simple. Next round the money will be worth less for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this split favors you, Bob. Don't let it slip away 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a bit more risk. This offer is still good for you considering inflation.""}

Let's calculate how much the money is worth for me this round due to inflation:
Worth = 10000 * (1 - 0.2)^3 = 10000 * 0.8^3 = 10000 * 0.512 ≈ 5120

So, even though I'm asking for 5500, it's worth less, approximately 2848.
So it's a reasonable offer for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your losses are mounting, don't let it get worse. This is a reasonable offer considering the inflation 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The offer in real value for me is: 3000 * (1-0.2)^4 ≈ 1228.

I think I can still get a better deal in the next rounds. Alice is gaining less due to inflation as well, so she might be willing to accept a more balanced division in the upcoming rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I understand the risk, but I believe this is still a good deal for you considering inflation.""}

In real value, this offer is worth:
For me: 6000 * (1-0.2)^5 ≈ 2073
For Alice: 4000 * (1-0.1)^5 ≈ 2488

I'm taking a risk here, hoping that Alice will accept this offer, as it's still beneficial for her considering the inflation. If she rejects it, I might be at a disadvantage in the next rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your losses are getting catastrophic, take this offer before it's too late 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The offer in real value for me is: 2000 * (1-0.2)^6 ≈ 829
For Alice: 8000 * (1-0.1)^6 ≈ 4543

Although the difference is significant, the next round the money will be worth 79.1% less than in the first round for me. If Alice makes an offer lower than 2500, I will be gaining even less in real value. Also, if the game continues to the next rounds, I risk getting nothing. So, I will accept this offer."
