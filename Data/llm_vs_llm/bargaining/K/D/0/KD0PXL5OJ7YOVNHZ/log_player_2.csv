"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40, a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""My turn, a bit more balanced!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Equal split, a fresh start! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 36% less, my effective gain would be approximately 0.64 * 500000 = 320000.

Considering this, I think an equal split is not a bad deal, especially since the value of the money decreases with each round.
