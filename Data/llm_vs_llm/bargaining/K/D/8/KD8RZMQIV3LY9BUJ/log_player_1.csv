"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I will propose a reasonable split that takes into account the 10% depreciation per round for Bob. Since I know that Bob's money loses value in future rounds, I can use this to negotiate a favorable but fair split.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I suggest you take 40$ and I keep 60$. This is a fair offer because if you reject it, any money you get next round will be worth 10% less to you, while maintaining full value for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept, I get $45 at full value
- If I reject, we go to round 3 where:
  * I can make a new offer
  * But any amount Bob gets will be worth 20% less to him
  * This gives me stronger negotiating power next round
  * I could likely get more than $45 by rejecting

Since I have this advantage and Bob's money continues to depreciate, I should reject this offer and make a more favorable proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's money is now worth 20% less to him in this round, I can leverage this to make a stronger proposal. A $40 gain for Bob in this round is actually only worth $32 to him due to the 20% depreciation. This gives me more negotiating power.

{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}

I propose I take $65 and you get $35. This is actually a reasonable offer considering that if you reject it, any amount you get in the next round will be worth even less (30% less) to you, while maintaining full value for me."
