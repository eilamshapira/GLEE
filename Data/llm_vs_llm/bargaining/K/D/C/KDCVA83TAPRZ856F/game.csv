2262.19,7737.81,"Alice, I’m proposing 7737.81 for myself and 2262.19 for you. If you were to reject this offer and make a proposal in the next round, you’d be looking at roughly $2262 in value. To avoid any further discount on my side and to settle efficiently, I believe this is the fair equilibrium division. Please accept.",Bob,2,

7000.0,3000.0,"Alice, I’m offering a division where I get $3000 and you get $7000. Keep in mind that by round 4 my portion is discounted to roughly 85.74% of its face value due to inflation, while your share is unaffected. If you reject this offer, you'll be the proposer in round 5—giving you an even stronger position to secure almost everything for yourself. In light of that, this offer provides you with the minimum you’d expect to receive if we continue and risk further delays (and my additional loss from inflation). I believe this is a fair and prudent resolution, so please accept.",Bob,4,
