"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Since we both lose value each round (you lose 10% and I lose 5%), it makes sense to agree now. I'm offering you a slight advantage with $5200 which recognizes that waiting would hurt you more than me. Let's avoid inflation and settle this fairly. 
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, since I lose more value per round than you do, I believe it's fair for me to propose a split that compensates for the higher inflation rate I'm facing. My offer of $5500 to me and $4500 to you reflects this need to settle quickly while still being equitable. Let's end this before our shares lose even more value.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concern about the higher inflation rate. However, I also face inflation, and by rejecting my first fair offer, we've both already lost value. Let's be completely fair with a 50-50 split. This avoids further losses for both of us. If we continue negotiating, you'll lose even more due to your higher inflation rate, so this equal split is actually advantageous for you when considering future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""Alice, with each round, the value of the money diminishes more for me than for you. My offer of $5800 to me and $4200 to you reflects the urgency to settle due to the disproportionate impact of inflation on my share. Let's agree now to avoid further losses, especially since my losses are accelerating. This proposal is fair considering our different inflation rates.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we've now gone through multiple rounds, and the value is significantly decreasing for both of us - but especially for you with your 10% inflation rate. At this point, you've lost over 27% of value while I've lost about 14%. If we continue, you'll lose even more. This offer actually gives you more real value than continuing to negotiate. My offer of $4800 to you now is worth more than $5800 would be after several more rounds. Let's end this cycle of declining value. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200
