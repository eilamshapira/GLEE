"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a reasonable offer that gives me a slight advantage but is still fair enough that Bob might accept it.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose this split because it gives me a small advantage while still offering Bob a substantial portion. Given that I know inflation will reduce my gain by 20% each round if we continue, it's important to try to reach an agreement early. This offer is fair enough that Bob might accept it rather than risk losing value through inflation in subsequent rounds."
