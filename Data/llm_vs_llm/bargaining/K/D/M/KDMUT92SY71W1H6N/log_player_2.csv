"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40, a fair start 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $400,000 for me
2. If I reject, next round I can make an offer, but:
   - The money will be worth 20% less for me ($800,000 effective total)
   - Only 5% less for Alice ($950,000 effective total)
   - This significant difference in inflation rates puts me at a disadvantage

While 40/60 isn't ideal, if I reject:
- My maximum potential gain in the next round would be worth less due to the steep 20% inflation
- Alice would still have strong negotiating power due to her lower inflation rate
- She might reject my counter-offer, leading to even worse outcomes

Given these factors, especially the harsh inflation rate for me, I should accept this reasonable first offer rather than risk getting less in future rounds.
