"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that Alice is offering me $200,000 out of the $1,000,000 total, which means she would get $800,000, I'll carefully consider this offer.

While I want to maximize my share, I should be strategic. The instructions mention that with each passing round, inflation makes the money worth 0% less for me (which actually means there's no inflation penalty for me). However, I don't know how inflation affects Alice, which might give me leverage in future rounds.

Since I can make a counter-offer in the next round and there's no penalty for me to continue negotiating, I'll reject this initial offer that gives me only 20% of the total amount.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more balanced offer that gives me a fair portion while still being attractive enough for Alice to potentially accept.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I suggest a 50-50 split which is fair to both of us. This balanced division respects the principle of equality and gives us both a significant amount."
