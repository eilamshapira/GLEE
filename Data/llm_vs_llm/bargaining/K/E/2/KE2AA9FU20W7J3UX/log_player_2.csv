"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer...

Alice is offering me $40 while keeping $60 for herself. While this isn't an even split, a few factors to consider:
1. If I reject, we move to next round where the total value decreases by 5% (down to $95 total)
2. I would need to offer a better deal that Alice would accept
3. $40 is still a substantial portion and not an unfair offer

However, since I will have the opportunity to make a counter-offer next round, and $40 vs $60 feels a bit too uneven, I'll try to negotiate for a better split.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll propose a more balanced split, but still giving Alice a slight advantage to make it more likely she'll accept. A 45-55 split seems fair and reasonable, considering that if she rejects, the next round will only have $95 total to split.

{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55}

I propose this split because:
1. It's more balanced than the previous 40-60 split
2. Alice still gets the larger share, which might make her more likely to accept
3. If she rejects, we'll both lose value due to the 5% inflation
4. This represents a good compromise between fairness and practicality"
