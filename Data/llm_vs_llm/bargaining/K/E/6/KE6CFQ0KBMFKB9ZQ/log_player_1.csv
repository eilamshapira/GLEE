"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Based on a backward‐induction analysis for this alternating‐offer game (with 12 rounds) – where in every round Bob’s dollars lose a further 20% of their value while Alice’s value stays constant – the (subgame perfect) equilibrium outcome in round 1 is for Alice to propose that she gets 737,856 dollars and Bob gets 262,144 dollars (which sum to 1,000,000). In equilibrium Bob is exactly indifferent between accepting this offer in round 1 (getting 262,144 dollars at full value) and waiting one round so that by his own discounting his eventual gain would be worth the same in today’s dollars.

Below is the JSON representation of the round‐1 proposal:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000
