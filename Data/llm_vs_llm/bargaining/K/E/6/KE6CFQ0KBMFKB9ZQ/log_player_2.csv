"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 262144 
# Alice gain: 737856 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether I should accept this offer, I need to consider the value of the money I would receive compared to the potential value in future rounds, taking into account the 20% decrease in value for me with each round.

Given that the money is worth 20% less to me with each passing round, I should calculate the present value of accepting this offer versus waiting.

However, since this is the first round, I haven't lost any value yet. Alice's offer gives me $262,144, and her $737,856.

Considering the significant difference and the fact that I haven't yet suffered from the inflation penalty, I should evaluate if this offer is reasonable enough to accept or if I can negotiate for a better split in subsequent rounds.

Given the rules, my best strategy would likely involve trying to get as close to an even split as possible or aiming for the highest amount I can reasonably negotiate, considering the inflation factor.

For now, I'll reject this offer to see if I can get a better deal in the next round, hoping that Alice will consider the inflation factor affecting me and propose a more balanced split or that I can negotiate a better split when it's my turn.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that the money is now worth 20% less to me due to the inflation penalty, the actual value I perceive is $800,000 (since 20% of $1,000,000 is $200,000).

To maximize my gain while also considering Alice's perspective (since she doesn't suffer from inflation), I should aim for a split that reflects the reduced value to me but is still reasonable for Alice to accept.

Aiming for a split that is as fair as possible under these conditions, I'll propose a division where I get slightly less than half, considering the inflation hit I've just taken.

Let's propose a 45% to 55% split in favor of Alice, given the circumstances.

45% of $1,000,000 is $450,000 for me, and 55% is $550,000 for Alice.

However, considering the inflation penalty, the value to me is actually 45% of $800,000, which is $360,000, but this is the value after applying the inflation penalty, so I'm proposing based on the original $1,000,000 for simplicity in negotiation.

My offer is:
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 327680 
# Alice gain: 672320 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that the money is now worth 36% less to me due to the inflation penalty (20% in the first round and another 20% of the remaining 80% in the second round, which is 16%, totaling 36% less value), I need to evaluate Alice's offer carefully.

Alice's offer gives me $327,680 and her $672,320.

Considering the inflation penalty, the actual value of $327,680 to me is 64% of $327,680 (since it's worth 36% less), which equals $209,792.

However, to make a decision, I should compare this to what I could potentially get in future rounds, taking into account the continued decrease in value due to inflation.

Given that Alice's offer is more generous than her initial one and considering the significant impact of inflation on my perceived value of the money, I need to weigh the benefits of accepting this offer against the risks of waiting for a potentially better deal.

Since the value to me decreases substantially with each round, and Alice's offer, while not ideal, represents a significant portion of the total, I should consider accepting this offer to avoid further erosion of the money's value to me.
