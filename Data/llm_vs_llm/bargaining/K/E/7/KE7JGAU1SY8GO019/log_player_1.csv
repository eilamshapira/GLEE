"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my first offer to divide the $10,000. Given that money loses 20% of its value for me each round, I should aim for a fair division that takes this inflation into account.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an equal split of the money. This seems fair to both of us, and since I face a 20% inflation penalty if we move to the next round, it would be beneficial to reach an agreement now."
