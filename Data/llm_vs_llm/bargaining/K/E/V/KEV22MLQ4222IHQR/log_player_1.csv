"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the inflation hit is on me this round, so to avoid further loss I propose a quick agreement. I'm offering a split of 520000 for me and 480000 for you—this compensates for the delayed value on my side while still giving you a fair share. Let’s settle now to save us both from additional erosion in value. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
