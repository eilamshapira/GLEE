"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. A slightly better deal for me in the first round seems reasonable considering the inflation.

# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand the inflation hit is on me this round, so to avoid further loss I propose a quick agreement. I'm offering a split of 520,000 for me and 480,000 for you—this compensates for the delayed value on my side while still giving you a fair share. Let’s settle now to save us both from additional erosion in value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the sentiment in your last offer.  Let's wrap this up. I'm willing to accept the split we would have reached after your initial rejection, accounting for one round of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
