5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, I'm proposing an equal 50-50 split which is fair to both of us. We're already facing 20% inflation from the first round, so the total is effectively worth $8000 now. Let's not lose more value - an equal division respects both our interests and maximizes our combined outcome.",Bob,2,
