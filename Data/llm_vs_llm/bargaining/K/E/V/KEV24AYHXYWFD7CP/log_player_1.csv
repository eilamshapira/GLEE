Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"":8000,""bob_gain"":2000,""message"":""I believe this is a fair offer. Let's take this deal and avoid inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm proposing an equal 50-50 split which is fair to both of us. We're already facing 20% inflation from the first round, so the total is effectively worth $8000 now. Let's not lose more value - an equal division respects both our interests and maximizes our combined outcome. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
