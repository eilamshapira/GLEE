"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I believe this is a fair offer. Let's take this deal and avoid inflation. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is proposing that I get $2,000 while she gets $8,000 out of the total $10,000. This is a 20-80 split, which heavily favors her. 

While she's correct that rejecting would lead to inflation (reducing the total value by 20% to $8,000 for the next round), I would be able to make a counter-offer in that case. Even after inflation, a fairer split of the remaining money would likely benefit me more than accepting just $2,000 now.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced division that addresses the inflation concern while being fairer to both parties.

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm proposing an equal 50-50 split which is fair to both of us. We're already facing 20% inflation from the first round, so the total is effectively worth $8,000 now. Let's not lose more value - an equal division respects both our interests and maximizes our combined outcome.""}"
