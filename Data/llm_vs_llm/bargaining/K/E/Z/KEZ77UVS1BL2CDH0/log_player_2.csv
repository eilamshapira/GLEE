"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

If I reject this offer:
- The $1M total will be worth 10% less to me in the next round ($900K effective value)
- I'll get to make the next proposal
- But Alice has no time pressure (no inflation for her)

Current offer gives me $400K, which is less than half but still substantial. If I reject, even if I propose a 50-50 split next round, my $500K would only be worth $450K due to 10% inflation.

Since I would likely end up with less value by rejecting and making a counter-offer, I should accept this offer.
