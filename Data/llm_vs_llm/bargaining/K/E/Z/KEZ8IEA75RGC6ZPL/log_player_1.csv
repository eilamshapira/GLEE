I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This seems fair given I'm the one initiating the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split. Since we're both taking a risk by rejecting offers, I think a fair and equal distribution is the best way to move forward."
