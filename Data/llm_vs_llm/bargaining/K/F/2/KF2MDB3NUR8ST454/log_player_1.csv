"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This way we both still benefit and keep some value before inflation hits harder. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

My $45 with 5% inflation is worth $42.75 to me now.
If I reject and we go to round 3, any amount will be worth another 5% less.
My initial offer of $60 was rejected, so Bob is clearly not willing to accept less than 50%.

This offer gives me a decent amount and avoids further value loss from inflation. While it's less than my initial proposal, the inflation impact makes it reasonable to accept now rather than risk further devaluation.
