"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This seems like a fair starting point, as I'm initiating the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5250, ""bob_gain"": 4750}
```

I'm proposing a 52.5/47.5 split in my favor.  This is still a fair offer considering the inflation, and hopefully, Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4200

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4750, ""bob_gain"": 5250}

I'm proposing a 47.5/52.5 split in my favor. This is a compromise, considering Bob's last offer, and the increasing inflation."
