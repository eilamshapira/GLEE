"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. 

Alice is offering me $4,000 out of the $10,000, which is 40% of the total. If I reject and move to the next round, I'll make a counter-offer, but the total value will decrease by 5% for me (so the $10,000 becomes worth $9,500 to me). For Alice, the decrease is more significant at 20%.

If I reject now, I can make a better proposal in the next round, and Alice will have stronger incentives to accept since her money will be worth significantly less (the $10,000 would only be worth $8,000 to her in round 2).

Given these inflation rates, I should reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that takes into account our different inflation rates. Since Alice faces a higher inflation rate (20% vs my 5%), she has a stronger incentive to reach an agreement quickly.

In this round, the $10,000 is worth $9,500 to me and only $8,000 to Alice. If we go to another round, Alice will lose even more value. I should propose a division that gives me a bit more than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable enough that she'll accept rather than moving to another round.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer considering our inflation rates.

Current situation:
- Alice is offering me $4,200 (up from her initial $4,000)
- Due to inflation, money is worth 9.75% less to me than in round 1
- For Alice, money is worth 36% less than in round 1

If I reject and move to round 4:
- I'll face additional 5% inflation (total ~14.75% from original)
- Alice will face additional 20% inflation (total ~56% from original)
- Alice's bargaining position will weaken significantly due to her higher inflation rate

Let me calculate the real value of her offer to me:
$4,200 with 9.75% inflation = $4,200 × (1 - 0.0975) = $3,790.50 in round 1 terms

This is still less than her original offer in real terms. Given Alice's much higher inflation penalty, I should reject and make a better counter-offer in round 4.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Now we're in round 4, and our inflation penalties have increased. Alice is facing much steeper inflation (56% from the original value) compared to my 14.75%. This gives me a stronger negotiating position.

Given that Alice already increased her previous offer to me from $4,000 to $4,200, she's showing some willingness to compromise. However, with her severe inflation penalty, I can now propose a more favorable split for myself while still making it rational for her to accept rather than continuing to the next round where she'll lose even more value.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully analyze this situation.

Current inflation effects:
- My money is worth 18.55% less than round 1
- Alice's money is worth 59.04% less than round 1

Alice's offer of $4,400 to me, adjusted for my inflation:
$4,400 × (1 - 0.1855) = $3,583.80 in round 1 terms

Alice's previous offers:
- Round 1: $4,000 (equivalent to $4,000)
- Round 3: $4,200 (equivalent to $3,790.50 in round 1 terms)
- Round 5: $4,400 (equivalent to $3,583.80 in round 1 terms)

Despite the nominal increase to $4,400, inflation means each offer is actually decreasing in real value to me.

If we go to round 6:
- My inflation increases by another 5% (to ~23.55%)
- Alice's inflation increases by another 20% (to ~79.04%)

Given Alice's severe inflation penalty, she's approaching a point where almost any deal is better than continuing. If I reject, I can make a much more favorable offer in round 6 that she would likely accept due to her extreme inflation rate.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","We're now in round 6, and the inflation effects have become extremely significant:
- My money is worth ~23.55% less than round 1
- Alice's money is worth ~79.04% less than round 1

This means for every additional round, Alice loses a tremendous amount of value - she's now only getting about 21% of the original value of any money allocated to her. This gives me very strong negotiating leverage.

Given Alice's extreme inflation penalty, almost any reasonable offer would be rational for her to accept rather than move to round 7 where she would lose another 20% of value. I'll propose a split that's heavily in my favor but still gives Alice enough incentive to accept rather than continuing.
