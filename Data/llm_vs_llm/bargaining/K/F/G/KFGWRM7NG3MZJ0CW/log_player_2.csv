"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's go with a fair share for both of us. How about I take 60% and you take 40%? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100
2. If I reject, we go to next round where:
   - I can make a counter-offer
   - But my money will be worth 5% less
   - $40 now is better than $42 in next round (which would be worth $39.90 after 5% inflation)

While a 50-50 split might seem more fair, considering the inflation penalty for delaying, accepting $40 now is better than risking a negotiation where my purchasing power decreases.
