5500.0,4500.0,"Alice, I'm proposing a more balanced split. While I understand your strategic position with the inflation factor, a 90/10 split was extremely uneven. This proposal gives you a majority share (55%) while still giving me a fair portion. If we continue to the next round, the inflation will reduce the total value of our split by another 10%, leaving us both with less overall. This is a win-win offer.",Bob,2,
