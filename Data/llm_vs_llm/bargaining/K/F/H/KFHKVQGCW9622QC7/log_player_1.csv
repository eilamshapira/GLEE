"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm proposing a more balanced split. While I understand your strategic position with the inflation factor, a 90/10 split was extremely uneven. This proposal gives you a majority share (55%) while still giving me a fair portion. If we continue to the next round, the inflation will reduce the total value of our split by another 10%, leaving us both with less overall. This is a win-win offer. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
