"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my first offer. I think it's fair, considering the inflation will affect you more than me in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","Looking at Alice's offer, I notice she's proposing I receive $1,000 while she gets $9,000 of the $10,000. This is a very uneven split in her favor.

I need to consider that if I reject, the money will be worth 10% less to me in the next round, but I'll be able to make a counter-offer. Even with the 10% inflation penalty, I should be able to propose a much more equitable division.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer that accounts for the inflation factor.

{""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""message"": ""Alice, I'm proposing a more balanced split. While I understand your strategic position with the inflation factor, a 90/10 split was extremely uneven. This proposal gives you a majority share (55%) while still giving me a fair portion. If we continue to the next round, the inflation will reduce the total value of our split by another 10%, leaving us both with less overall. This is a win-win offer.""}"
