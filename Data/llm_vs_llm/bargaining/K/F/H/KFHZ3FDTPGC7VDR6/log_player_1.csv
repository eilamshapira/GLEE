"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. I want to start with a reasonable offer, considering the inflation effect on my potential gains in later rounds.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I see Bob's offer. Considering the inflation, I need to calculate the real value of his offer to me.

*   **Original Value:** $55
*   **Inflation:** 5% less than round 1.
*   **Adjusted Value:** $55 * (1 - 0.05) = $52.25

I will accept the offer, since it's still a reasonable amount.
