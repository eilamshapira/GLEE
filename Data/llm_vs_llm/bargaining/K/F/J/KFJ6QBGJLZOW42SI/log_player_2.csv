"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Let's see if Alice can do better in the next round. Since the value of the money decreases more for her, she might be willing to offer more to reach an agreement sooner."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

With this offer, I'm aiming to get a bit more than half, considering that the value of the money decreases faster for Alice than for me. Let's see if Alice accepts this offer or makes a counteroffer in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is still not generous enough, considering the inflation rate for her is higher than mine. Let's see if she can offer more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200}

Given that the value of money is decreasing faster for Alice, I'm willing to take more risk and ask for a higher amount. Let's see if Alice accepts this offer or makes a counteroffer in the next round."
