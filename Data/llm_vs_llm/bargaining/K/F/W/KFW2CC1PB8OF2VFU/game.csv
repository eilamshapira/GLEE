1000000.0,0.0,"Hi Bob, here's my offer: I take all $1000000 and you get nothing. Note that because money loses 5% of its value for you each round while my value is unaffected, delaying won’t help your situation. I’m confident that you’ll see that accepting today is your best (and only) option.",Alice,1,

55555.0,944445.0,"Hi Bob, here's my proposal for round 3. Given that in every round you lose an extra 5% of nominal value, waiting only hurts your position. In round 3 your money is worth 90% of its face value, so 944445 dollars gives you an effective 850000—roughly what you could expect as proposer next round. Meanwhile, I receive 55555 dollars (full value for me). This split reflects your strong position if you waited, but since delaying further only devalues your gains, I believe this offer is rational and fair. Let's settle now.",Alice,3,
