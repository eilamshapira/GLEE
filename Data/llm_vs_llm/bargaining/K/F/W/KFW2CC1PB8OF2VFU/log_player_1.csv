"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 1000000, ""bob_gain"": 0, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my offer: I take all $1,000,000 and you get nothing. Note that because money loses 5% of its value for you each round while my value is unaffected, delaying won’t help your situation. I’m confident that you’ll see that accepting today is your best (and only) option.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's split it 50/50. It's the fairest way, and better than risking losing more value by delaying. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55555, ""bob_gain"": 944445, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal for round 3. Given that in every round you lose an extra 5% of nominal value, waiting only hurts your position. In round 3 your money is worth 90% of its face value, so 944,445 dollars gives you an effective 850,000—roughly what you could expect as proposer next round. Meanwhile, I receive 55,555 dollars (full value for me). This split reflects your strong position if you waited, but since delaying further only devalues your gains, I believe this offer is rational and fair. Let's settle now.""}"
