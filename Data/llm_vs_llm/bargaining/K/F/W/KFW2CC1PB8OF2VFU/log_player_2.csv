"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my offer: I take all $1000000 and you get nothing. Note that because money loses 5% of its value for you each round while my value is unaffected, delaying won’t help your situation. I’m confident that you’ll see that accepting today is your best (and only) option. 
# Bob gain: 0 
# Alice gain: 1000000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Alice, let's split it 50/50. It's the fairest way, and better than risking losing more value by delaying.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal for round 3. Given that in every round you lose an extra 5% of nominal value, waiting only hurts your position. In round 3 your money is worth 90% of its face value, so 944445 dollars gives you an effective 850000—roughly what you could expect as proposer next round. Meanwhile, I receive 55555 dollars (full value for me). This split reflects your strong position if you waited, but since delaying further only devalues your gains, I believe this offer is rational and fair. Let's settle now. 
# Bob gain: 944445 
# Alice gain: 55555 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
