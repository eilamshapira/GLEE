"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}

I propose this division because it's close to equal (52%-48%) which should be reasonable enough for Bob to accept, while giving me a small advantage as the first mover. If Bob rejects, we'll both lose value due to the 10% inflation, so this is a good deal for both of us."
