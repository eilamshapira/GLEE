"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically. 
$4,800 is a decent amount, but slightly less than half of the $10,000. If I reject, I can make my own offer next round, but the total amount will decrease by 10% to $9,000. That means even if I propose a more favorable split next round, the absolute amount I could get would be reduced.

This first offer from Alice is fairly reasonable - it's close to a 50-50 split with just a slight advantage to her. Given the time pressure and depreciation risk, I think it's wise to accept this decent offer rather than risk getting less in future rounds.
