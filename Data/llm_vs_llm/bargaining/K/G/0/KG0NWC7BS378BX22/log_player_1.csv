"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, considering I need to make it attractive enough for Bob to accept and avoid inflation eating into my gains.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I would explain to Bob: ""I propose a 55-45 split, giving me $550,000 and you $450,000. This is a fair offer that gives both of us a substantial amount, and accepting now means we avoid losing value to inflation in subsequent rounds."""
