"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 0, ""bob_gain"": 100, ""message"": ""Bob, since waiting only reduces my share’s value while yours remains intact, I propose we conclude now: you get the full $100 and I take nothing. I know that if you reject and we move to Round 2, you—as the proposer—can secure the entire $100 anyway. To avoid delays and needless complexity, please accept my offer.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, since the money's value decreases for you with each round, it's in your best interest to accept a reasonable offer now. I'm offering you $20, which is a significant portion considering the diminishing value for you. Let's conclude the game here. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
