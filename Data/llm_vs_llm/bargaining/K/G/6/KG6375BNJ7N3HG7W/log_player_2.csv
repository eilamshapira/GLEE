"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, since waiting only reduces my share’s value while yours remains intact, I propose we conclude now: you get the full $100 and I take nothing. I know that if you reject and we move to Round 2, you—as the proposer—can secure the entire $100 anyway. To avoid delays and needless complexity, please accept my offer. 
# Bob gain: 100 
# Alice gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 80, 
""alice_gain"": 20, 
""message"": ""Alice, since the money's value decreases for you with each round, it's in your best interest to accept a reasonable offer now. I'm offering you $20, which is a significant portion considering the diminishing value for you. Let's conclude the game here.""}"
