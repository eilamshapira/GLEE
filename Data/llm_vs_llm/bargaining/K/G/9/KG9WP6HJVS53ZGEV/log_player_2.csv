"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll carefully consider Alice's proposal to split the $100 evenly, with $50 for each of us.

This is a fair 50-50 split, which is objectively equitable. However, I need to consider the inflation factor in this game. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total amount will be worth 20% less (only $80 worth of value). That means even if I managed to get a larger percentage in the next round, the absolute value might be lower than $50.

Since this is the first round with the full $100 value, and Alice has offered an equal split, this is a reasonable offer.
