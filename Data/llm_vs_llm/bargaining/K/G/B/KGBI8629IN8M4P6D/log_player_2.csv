"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this... 

Alice has offered a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance. However, with the inflation effect, if I accept now, my $50 would be worth the full value. If I reject and we continue to later rounds, my share would be worth less due to the 20% inflation per round.

Since this is the first round and I'm being offered half of the total amount with no inflation penalty, this is actually a pretty good deal. If I reject, I might end up with less value even if I get a larger nominal amount in later rounds.
