"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
- Alice proposes a 50-50 split, which is fair
- If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
- However, due to 5% inflation, if I wait:
  * Next round the $50 would only be worth $47.50 to me
  * I would need to get at least $52.63 next round to match current value
- A fair split now is better than risking value loss through inflation
