"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer is a 50-50 split, dividing the $10,000 equally between us. This is a fair and equitable division where we both get $5,000.

Given that the money loses 5% of its value each round, if I reject this offer:
- In round 2, we'd only be dividing $9,500 (95% of $10,000)
- Even if I proposed a better split for myself in the next round, the total amount would be less
- There's also no guarantee Alice would accept my counter-offer

A 50-50 split is generally considered fair in these situations, and accepting now maximizes our collective value.
