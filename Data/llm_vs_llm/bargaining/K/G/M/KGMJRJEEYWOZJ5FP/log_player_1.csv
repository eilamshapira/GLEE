"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair offer considering both our interests, keeping in mind that inflation affects Bob more than me.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm proposing a slightly favorable split for me, but one that still gives Bob a substantial portion. Since inflation affects Bob more than me, it makes sense for him to accept a reasonable offer now rather than waiting for future rounds where his share would be worth less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll adjust my offer to find a more acceptable middle ground.

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}

I'm offering Bob a larger share than my previous proposal. This is a fair compromise that recognizes both our interests. With inflation affecting Bob more each round, this offer should be more attractive to him now than waiting for future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","I see we're having difficulty reaching an agreement. Let me propose a more balanced split.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm offering an even 50-50 split. This is completely fair and equitable. Given that inflation continues to affect Bob's gains (now over 27% less value for him), accepting this equal division now would be in his best interest rather than continuing further rounds where his money will be worth even less."
