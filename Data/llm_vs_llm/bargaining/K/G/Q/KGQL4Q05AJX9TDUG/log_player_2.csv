"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly and avoid inflation losses 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate this offer from Alice.

Alice is proposing an even split of the $100, giving each of us $50. Since we're told that inflation doesn't affect me (0% inflation for me), there's no particular advantage for me to wait for future rounds.

This is a fair offer that gives me half of the total amount. Without knowing how inflation affects Alice, I can't be certain if waiting would put me in a better position. A 50-50 split is generally considered equitable in these types of games.
