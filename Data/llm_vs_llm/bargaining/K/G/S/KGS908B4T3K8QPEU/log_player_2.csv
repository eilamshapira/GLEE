"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly. I get 40, you get 60. 
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $60, which is more than half
2. If I reject, the total amount will decrease by 20% to $80 in the next round
3. Even if I propose a more favorable split next round, I'd need to get most of the $80 to beat the current $60 offer
4. This is actually a generous first offer from Alice

Given these factors, I should accept this favorable offer.
