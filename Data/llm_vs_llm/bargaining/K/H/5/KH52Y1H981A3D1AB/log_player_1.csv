Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I rejected your offer because it felt a bit one-sided. Let's go for a 50/50 split this time. It's fair and square, considering the value is decreasing for me with each round. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
