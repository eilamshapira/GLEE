"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split while considering that inflation will affect future rounds for me. Since this is the first round, I'll offer a balanced division that should be attractive to Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split of the money. This is a fair and equitable division that respects both parties equally and should be appealing to Bob. Given that inflation will reduce the value of money in future rounds for me, this immediate equal split is a reasonable starting point."
