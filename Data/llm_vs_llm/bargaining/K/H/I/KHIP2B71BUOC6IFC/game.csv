1.0,9999.0,"Alice, every extra round costs you 20% in value. If you reject now, you'll be making an offer next round but will be forced to concede nearly everything to Bob to get him to accept. I'm giving you $1 now—a better outcome than nothing in the future. Accept this offer and let's close the deal.",Bob,2,

4000.0,6000.0,"Bob, this is your last chance. I'm losing value every round. Take this or I will have to offer even less next time.",Alice,3,

1.0,9999.0,"Alice, every additional round further devalues your share—in round 4, your dollars are worth just over 50% of their original value, and if you wait until round 5 you’ll be forced into an almost zero outcome. I'm offering you $1 nominal now, which gives you an effective value of about $0.51. This is better than the future alternative. Accept this offer and let’s conclude the game.",Bob,4,

1000.0,9000.0,"Bob, I'm at the point where I have to give you almost everything. Please just accept this.",Alice,5,

1.0,9999.0,"Alice, time is not on your side. In round 6, your $1 is worth about $0.33—far better than the fate you face if you wait. If you reject, you'll be forced into making your own offer in round 7, where the discount drops your share even further to roughly 26% of its nominal value. I'm giving you a tiny, yet relatively better, amount now. Accept this deal, and we both end this costly game.",Bob,6,

100.0,9900.0,"Bob, this is all I can offer. Please, please, just accept it. I'm practically giving you everything.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
200.0,9800.0,"Alice, every moment we delay further, your share loses significant value—in round 8, each dollar for you is only worth about 21 cents. If you reject this offer, you'll be in the proposer’s seat next round but will be forced to concede nearly everything to me, leaving you with almost nothing in effective terms. I'm offering you $200 now, which, though it may seem small nominally, is worth roughly $42 in real value for you. This is your best chance to avoid an even worse outcome. Please accept this offer and let's conclude the game.",Bob,8,
