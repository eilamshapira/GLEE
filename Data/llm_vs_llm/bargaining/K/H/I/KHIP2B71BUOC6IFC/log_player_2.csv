Accept this offer and let's close the deal.""}"

I'm offering you $1 nominal now, which gives you an effective value of about $0.51. This is better than the future alternative. Accept this offer and let’s conclude the game.""}"

If you reject, you'll be forced into making your own offer in round 7, where the discount drops your share even further to roughly 26% of its nominal value. I'm giving you a tiny, yet relatively better, amount now. Accept this deal, and we both end this costly game.""}"

If you reject this offer, you'll be in the proposer’s seat next round but will be forced to concede nearly everything to me, leaving you with almost nothing in effective terms. I'm offering you $200 now, which, though it may seem small nominally, is worth roughly $42 in real value for you. This is your best chance to avoid an even worse outcome.
