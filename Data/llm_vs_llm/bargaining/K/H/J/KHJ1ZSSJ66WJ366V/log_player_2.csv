"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a fair 50-50 split. With inflation reducing the value by 20% each round for me, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement now rather than later. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Alice's offer is a fair 50-50 split and considering the inflation, it's a reasonable proposal. Given that I don't know the exact inflation rate for Alice but she mentioned it's 20% for her, and for me, it's 10%, accepting this offer seems like the best option to avoid further devaluation of the money.
