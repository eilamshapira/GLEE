"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer is a 40/60 split in Alice's favor
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 5% less for me next round
3. However, it will be worth 10% less for Alice
4. I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer, since Alice has more pressure from inflation
5. 4000$ is too low considering I have the advantage of lower inflation pressure

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll propose a more favorable split for me, but still reasonable enough that Alice might accept given her higher inflation pressure:

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

This is a 55/45 split which is more equitable than Alice's initial offer, and considering that Alice faces higher inflation pressure (10% vs my 5%), she might be motivated to accept rather than continue negotiating while the money loses more value for her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice is now offering a 50/50 split, which is more equitable than her first offer
2. For me, $5000 with 9.75% inflation means I'd effectively get $4,512.50
3. For Alice, $5000 with 19% inflation means she'd effectively get $4,050
4. If I reject:
   - Next round my inflation goes to ~15%
   - Alice's inflation goes to ~29%
   - The gap widens significantly

Since Alice is already feeling more inflation pressure and is offering an equal split, this is actually a good deal for me. If we continue, we both lose more value and Alice might become more aggressive in her demands to compensate for her higher inflation losses.
