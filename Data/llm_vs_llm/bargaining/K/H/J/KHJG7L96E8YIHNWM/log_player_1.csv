"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll send an offer that takes into account the asymmetric inflation rates between Bob and me. Since Bob faces a 10% devaluation each round while I face no inflation, I have a stronger position as rounds progress.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose a split where I receive $5,500 and Bob receives $4,500. This is a fair offer considering the inflation dynamics - Bob has incentive to accept reasonably early since his money loses value with each round, while mine doesn't."
