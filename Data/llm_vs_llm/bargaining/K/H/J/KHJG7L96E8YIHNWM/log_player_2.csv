"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $4,500 out of $10,000
2. If I reject, we move to round 2, where:
   * I can make a counter-offer
   * My money will be worth 10% less
   * $4,500 in this round is better than $5,000 in the next round (which would be worth $4,500 after 10% inflation)

While the split isn't exactly 50-50, it's a reasonable offer considering I face inflation pressure and Alice doesn't. If I reject, I'll have less negotiating power in future rounds due to inflation, and Alice knows this.
