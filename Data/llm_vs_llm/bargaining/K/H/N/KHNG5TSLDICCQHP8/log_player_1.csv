Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the inflation puts me at a disadvantage, but your initial offer was too low. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer as it's a reasonable compromise. While I could potentially get more by rejecting and continuing negotiations, the risk of further rounds and potentially getting nothing if we can't agree isn't worth it. This is a fair split considering the circumstances."
