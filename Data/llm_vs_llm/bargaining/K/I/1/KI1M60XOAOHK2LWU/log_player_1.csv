"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I need to consider the actual value of the offer. 
The original value of $500,000 is now worth $500,000 * 0.8 = $400,000 to me.
Considering this, I think the offer is not in my favor.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 20% * 2 = 40% less than the original value (20% less in round 1 and another 20% less in round 2, which is equivalent to 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64). 
The money Bob gains is worth 10% * 2 = 20% less than the original value (10% less in round 1 and another 10% less in round 2, which is equivalent to 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81).

To make a fair offer, I'll consider these values.
Let's say I offer $550,000 to myself and $450,000 to Bob. 
The actual value of my gain would be $550,000 * 0.64 = $352,000, and the actual value of Bob's gain would be $450,000 * 0.81 = $364,500.

However, I want to make a more favorable offer for myself. 
Let's try $580,000 for myself and $420,000 for Bob.
The actual value of my gain would be $580,000 * 0.64 = $371,200, and the actual value of Bob's gain would be $420,000 * 0.81 = $340,200.

{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 48.8% less, I need to consider the actual value of the offer. 
The original value of $550,000 is now worth $550,000 * (1 - 0.488) = $550,000 * 0.512 = $281,600 to me.

Considering this, I think the offer is not extremely unfavorable, but I should weigh my options.
