"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100 
# Alice gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice is offering me the entire $100, I need to consider what's fair and what she might accept in future rounds.

Given that Alice faces a 5% loss per round, she still has incentives to reach a deal. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer that gives both of us something reasonable.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a more balanced split that gives Alice a decent amount while still being advantageous to me.

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I'm suggesting a 60-40 split in my favor. This gives Alice a substantial portion while still being favorable to me. Since time affects Alice's money value but not mine, this should be a reasonable offer that acknowledges her declining position while still being fair enough that she might accept rather than prolonging negotiations."
