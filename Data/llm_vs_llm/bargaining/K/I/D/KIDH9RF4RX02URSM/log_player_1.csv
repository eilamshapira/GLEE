"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a proposal that considers the inflation rates for both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose a 55-45 split in our favor. Since my inflation rate is higher (20% vs your 5%), it's in both our interests to resolve this quickly. This split acknowledges the slightly more urgent position I'm in while still being fair to you, Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
