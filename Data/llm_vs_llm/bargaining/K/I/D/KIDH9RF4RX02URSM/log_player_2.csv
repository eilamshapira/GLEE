"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering me $45 and keeping $55 for herself. Given that inflation affects me at 5% per round and affects Alice at 20% per round, I need to consider whether waiting for a better deal would be advantageous.

If I reject now, I can make a counter-offer next round, but Alice's 20% inflation penalty means she might be more eager to settle sooner rather than later. At the same time, my 5% penalty is relatively small.

I think I can get a better deal by making my own offer in the next round, so I'll reject this initial offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer that accounts for our different inflation rates. Since Alice faces a much higher inflation rate (20% per round) compared to mine (5% per round), she should be more motivated to reach an agreement sooner. I'll propose a more balanced split that's still advantageous to me.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'm offering a division where I get $55 and Alice gets $45. This is fair considering that if Alice rejects, her next potential earnings will be worth significantly less due to her higher inflation rate. This offer gives us both a substantial portion while acknowledging our different time preferences."
