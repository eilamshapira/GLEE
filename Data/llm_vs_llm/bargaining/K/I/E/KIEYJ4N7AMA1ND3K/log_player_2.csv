"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's offer of $40 for me and $60 for her.

While I could reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, I need to consider that Alice might then reject my offer, leading to further rounds. The offer gives me 40% of the total sum, which is less than half but still substantial.
