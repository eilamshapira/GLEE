"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

My reasoning: I'm starting with a slightly more favorable offer to myself, but still giving Bob a reasonable amount. I'm hoping this will be accepted quickly, avoiding the inflation penalty I'll incur in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I'll consider Bob's offer in light of the inflation. My $ is now worth 95% of what it was in round 1.

Let's calculate: If I accept, I get $45, which is worth $45 * 0.95 = $42.75 in round 1 dollars.

Given the rapidly decreasing value of my potential gains, I'll accept this offer.
