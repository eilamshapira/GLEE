"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $45 while she gets $55. I should keep in mind that with each round, the money is worth 5% less to Alice but stays the same value for me. This gives me some negotiating leverage in later rounds, but I also don't want to drag this out too long.

Given that this is just the first round and I have room to negotiate for a better deal, I'll make a counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more favorable to me while still being reasonable enough that Alice might accept it.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'm offering a split where I get $55 and Alice gets $45. This is a mirror of her initial offer, giving me the larger share. Since Alice faces a 5% devaluation per round, she has some incentive to accept sooner rather than later, while I don't face that same pressure."
