"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split the $100 as $60 for me and $40 for you. Considering that each round delays value, accepting this offer now ensures we both benefit from an immediate and fair agreement. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'd like to propose an even split of $50 each. This way, we both benefit equally and immediately, avoiding any further loss in value due to inflation. Let's settle this fairly and move on! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your fair offer. Given that my share in round 2 is worth 20% less than in round 1, settling now with $50 each is a wise choice to avoid further loss from inflation. I'm happy to accept your proposal!""}"
