"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to think about this offer carefully. 

Alice is offering me $4,500 while she keeps $5,500. If I reject, I'll get to make a counteroffer next round, but the total value will be worth 20% less to me (so the $10,000 becomes worth $8,000 from my perspective).

If I reject and propose in the next round, even if I ask for the entire $10,000, it would only be worth $8,000 to me due to inflation. That's worse than taking $4,500 now.

Even if I propose something like a 6000/4000 split in my favor next round, that $6,000 would only be worth $4,800 to me after inflation, which is only slightly better than the current offer.

Given the inflation penalty, it makes sense to accept this reasonable offer now.
