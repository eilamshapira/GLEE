"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split that gives me a slight edge. This is a good starting point for negotiations, Bob! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer...

She's offering me $4,500 while taking $5,500 for herself. While this isn't an equal split, it's reasonably close to 50-50. Since there's no inflation affecting my share and we have many rounds left, I can try to negotiate for a better deal.

However, there's always the risk that future negotiations could lead to worse outcomes, and $4,500 is a substantial amount. But I think I can get a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a perfectly equal split, which is fair and reasonable for both parties.

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""I believe a 50-50 split is the fairest solution for both of us. This way, we both walk away with an equal share, and there's no need for further negotiation.""}"
