This is fair considering we both need to reach an agreement quickly. The 5% inflation is already affecting my potential earnings, so I hope we can agree soon.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, let's meet in the middle. I'm offering you $4500 and I'll take $5500. This is actually more favorable to you than my first offer, and we both need to agree soon as inflation is eating away at our gains. Each round costs us money - let's be practical and settle this now.",Alice,3,
