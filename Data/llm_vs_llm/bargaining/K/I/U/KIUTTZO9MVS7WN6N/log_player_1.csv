Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a more balanced split. I'm proposing I get $5500 and you get $4500. This is fair considering we both need to reach an agreement quickly. The 5% inflation is already affecting my potential earnings, so I hope we can agree soon. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
