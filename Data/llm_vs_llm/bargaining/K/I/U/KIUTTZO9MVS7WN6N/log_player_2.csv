"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to agree quickly due to inflation affecting our gains. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's first offer gives me $4,000 while she takes $6,000. While this is less than half, I need to consider the 5% inflation per round that affects me. If I reject and make a counter-offer, I'll already be facing some depreciation.

Let me think strategically. If I reject, I can propose a more favorable split in the next round, but the total value to me will be reduced by 5%. I should consider whether waiting and negotiating is worth the decreasing value.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I need to balance fairness with the fact that inflation is affecting me by 5% each round. I'll propose a more even split while acknowledging the time pressure we both face.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a more balanced split. I'm proposing I get $5,500 and you get $4,500. This is fair considering we both need to reach an agreement quickly. The 5% inflation is already affecting my potential earnings, so I hope we can agree soon.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's meet in the middle. I'm offering you $4500 and I'll take $5500. This is actually more favorable to you than my first offer, and we both need to agree soon as inflation is eating away at our gains. Each round costs us money - let's be practical and settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is now offering me $4,500, which is an improvement from her initial $4,000 offer. Due to inflation, my gains are now worth 9.75% less than in round 1, which means this $4,500 is effectively worth about $4,061 compared to round 1 value.

If I reject and we continue to round 4, I'll face even more inflation, and there's no guarantee Alice will accept my next offer. Since Alice moved significantly from her initial position and we're already experiencing substantial inflation, accepting now seems reasonable.
