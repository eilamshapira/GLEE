"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm offering you a sizable portion to end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer since there's no downside for me to continue negotiating (my money doesn't lose value due to inflation), and I believe I can get a better deal. The initial 50-50 split I proposed was more fair, and Bob's position is actually weaker due to their inflation penalty."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Bob, since your money loses 20% value each round due to inflation, you should accept this offer now. If we continue, your position will only get worse. This is actually a better deal for you than waiting.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it's clear we both want a larger share.  This is my final offer, take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer because my position is getting stronger with each round. Since I'm not affected by inflation while Bob's share loses significant value each round (now almost 50% less valuable for them), I can negotiate for a better deal. There's no incentive for me to accept less than my original 50-50 proposal, especially when Bob's effective value is diminishing."

""message"": ""Bob, your money has lost nearly 50% of its value due to inflation. Even this smaller nominal amount I'm offering you is better than continuing further negotiations where your share will lose even more value. This is your best option now.""
