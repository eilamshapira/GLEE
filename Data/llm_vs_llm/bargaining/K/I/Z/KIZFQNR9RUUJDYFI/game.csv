60.0,40.0,"Let's make a deal! I take $60, you take $40. It's a good offer for you in the long run.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
9.0,91.0,"Alice, I know you might be tempted to counter in the next round, but remember that with each round your $ devalues by 20% while mine only by 10%. If you reject, you'll have to offer me almost everything in round 3 to get my acceptance – leaving you with hardly any real value. Accept this offer now: you get $9 (worth $7.2 in today’s terms) and I get $91 (worth $81.9 today). It's in both our interests to settle immediately.",Bob,2,

15.0,85.0,"Bob, I understand the impact of inflation, but your last offer was far too low.  Let's be reasonable. I'll take $15, which is worth significantly less now, and you get the lion's share with $85.  This deal makes sense for both of us.",Alice,3,
