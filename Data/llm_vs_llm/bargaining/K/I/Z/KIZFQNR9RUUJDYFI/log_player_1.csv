"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know you might be tempted to counter in the next round, but remember that with each round your $ devalues by 20% while mine only by 10%. If you reject, you'll have to offer me almost everything in round 3 to get my acceptance – leaving you with hardly any real value. Accept this offer now: you get $9 (worth $7.2 in today’s terms) and I get $91 (worth $81.9 today). It's in both our interests to settle immediately. 
# Alice gain: 9 
# Bob gain: 91 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 15,
""bob_gain"": 85,
""message"": ""Bob, I understand the impact of inflation, but your last offer was far too low.  Let's be reasonable. I'll take $15, which is worth significantly less now, and you get the lion's share with $85.  This deal makes sense for both of us.""
}
```

Let's break down why this offer makes sense:

* **Acknowledging Inflation:**  The message directly addresses the elephant in the room - the decreasing value of the money.
* **Finding a Middle Ground:** While Bob's offer was heavily skewed in his favor, this counter-offer shows a willingness to compromise but not be completely taken advantage of.
* **Highlighting the Loss:** By emphasizing that $15 is now worth much less, it subtly reminds Bob of the time pressure and encourages him to settle.

This offer aims to strike a balance between getting a reasonable deal and avoiding a protracted negotiation where the value dwindles further."
