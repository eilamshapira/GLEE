"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal! I take $60, you take $40. It's a good offer for you in the long run. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 91, ""alice_gain"": 9, ""message"": ""Alice, I know you might be tempted to counter in the next round, but remember that with each round your $ devalues by 20% while mine only by 10%. If you reject, you'll have to offer me almost everything in round 3 to get my acceptance – leaving you with hardly any real value. Accept this offer now: you get $9 (worth $7.2 in today’s terms) and I get $91 (worth $81.9 today). It's in both our interests to settle immediately.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the impact of inflation, but your last offer was far too low.  Let's be reasonable. I'll take $15, which is worth significantly less now, and you get the lion's share with $85.  This deal makes sense for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 85 
# Alice gain: 15 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
