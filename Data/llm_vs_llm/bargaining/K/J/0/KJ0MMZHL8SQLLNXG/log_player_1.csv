"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer that accounts for our differing inflation rates.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm proposing this split since we both face inflation if we delay agreement. With my 5% inflation rate and your higher 10% rate, it makes sense for both of us to reach an agreement quickly. This is a fair division that gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging my slight advantage in terms of inflation pressure."
