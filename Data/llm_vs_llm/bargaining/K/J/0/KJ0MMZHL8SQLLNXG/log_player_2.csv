"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. I'm being offered $4,500 out of $10,000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to inflation:
   - My $4,500 now would be worth more than any amount in the next round (10% less)
   - Alice's loss will be less severe (5% less)
4. If I reject, any $5,000 in the next round would be worth $4,500 now
5. Alice has given me a fairly reasonable split (45-55)

Given the significant inflation penalty I face and the reasonable initial offer, I should accept.
