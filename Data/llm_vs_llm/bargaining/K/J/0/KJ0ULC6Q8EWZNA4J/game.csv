0.0,100.0,"Hi Bob. Given that with every extra round my $100 is worth 10% less while yours remains constant, you know your waiting power. To avoid any delays—and since you can get nearly 100 by waiting—I’m proposing to hand over the entire $100 to you right away. I hope you’ll accept this immediate deal.",Alice,1,
