"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob. Given that with every extra round my $100 is worth 10% less while yours remains constant, you know your waiting power. To avoid any delays—and since you can get nearly 100 by waiting—I’m proposing to hand over the entire $100 to you right away. I hope you’ll accept this immediate deal. 
# Bob gain: 100 
# Alice gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","I appreciate Alice's understanding of the situation. Her offer is fair given the incentives in this game.
