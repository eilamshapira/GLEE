"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer is 400k for me and 600k for Alice
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 20% inflation, my 400k would be worth only 320k next round if I reject
4. Making a better deal next round would be difficult since Alice would also factor in inflation
5. 400k is a significant portion (40%) of the total amount
6. The risk of continued negotiation with inflation might lead to worse outcomes

Given these factors, especially the harsh inflation penalty, it makes sense to accept this reasonable first offer rather than risk getting less in future rounds.
