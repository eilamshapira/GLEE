"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This seems fair considering the inflation risk for me. Let's settle this quickly! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether to accept Alice's offer or make a counteroffer.

Alice is offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000 (40%), while taking $600,000 (60%).

If I reject this offer, I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, but the money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation. That means the $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $800,000 to me in the next round.

If I were to get 50% in the next round ($500,000), that would be worth $400,000 to me after inflation. Since Alice's current offer gives me $400,000, I'd need to secure more than 50% in the next round to benefit from rejecting.

Given the inflation risk and the reasonable split Alice proposed, I'll accept this offer.
