"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","For the first round, I'll make a reasonable offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob with each passing round, I'll try to be fair but also consider the decreasing value.

Here's my offer:
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

This offer gives me 55% of the total amount and Bob 45%. Let's see how Bob responds!"
