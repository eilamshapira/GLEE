"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a fair 50/50 split – $5000 for each of us. I’m eager to settle now because with each round the money erodes for me (and I hope it won’t for you too). Let’s avoid unnecessary delays and secure our gains immediately. I look forward to your acceptance!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate the sentiment of a 50/50 split. How about we start with a slightly adjusted version to show our commitment to a quick resolution? Let's do $5100 for me and $4900 for you. This way we both benefit from wrapping up the game early. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the quick counteroffer, Bob. Given the inflation impact on my share, settling now is wiser than risking further losses. I accept the offer: $4900 for me and $5100 for you.""}"
