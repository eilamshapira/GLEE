"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a fair 50/50 split – $5000 for each of us. I’m eager to settle now because with each round the money erodes for me (and I hope it won’t for you too). Let’s avoid unnecessary delays and secure our gains immediately. I look forward to your acceptance! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

How about we start with a slightly adjusted version to show our commitment to a quick resolution? Let's do $5100 for me and $4900 for you. This way we both benefit from wrapping up the game early.""}"
