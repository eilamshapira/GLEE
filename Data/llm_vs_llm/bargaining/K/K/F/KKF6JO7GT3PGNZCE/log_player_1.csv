"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it 50-50. This is better for both of us than continuing negotiations with inflation. You'd still get more real value than me due to your lower inflation rate. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
