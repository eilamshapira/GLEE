"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal. This offer ensures you get a decent share now. With inflation, it's only downhill from here, especially for you. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $350,000 for me, $650,000 for Alice

2. If I reject:
- Next round I can make an offer
- But my money will be worth 10% less ($900,000 total value for me)
- Alice's money will be worth 5% less ($950,000 total value for her)
- I could propose a better split, but she might reject

3. Alice is right about inflation hurting me more (10% vs 5%)

4. While $350,000 isn't an equal split, getting it now might be better than risking further devaluation

However, given that:
- The split is quite uneven (35/65)
- I still have negotiating power in the next round
- Even with 10% inflation, I could propose a better split

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer while acknowledging the inflation pressure:

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it 50-50. This is better for both of us than continuing negotiations with inflation. You'd still get more real value than me due to your lower inflation rate.""}

This offer is strategic because:
1. It's a fair split that's hard to argue against ethically
2. It's better for Alice than her initial offer after accounting for her 5% inflation
3. If she rejects, she'll face 5% more inflation in the next round
4. The 50-50 split makes me appear reasonable rather than greedy
5. I acknowledge her advantage in inflation rates, which shows I'm thinking long-term"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the attempt at a 50/50 split, but let's be realistic.  I'm offering you a larger share than my previous offer recognizing the impact of inflation on your gains.  This is a fair deal considering time is on my side. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this updated situation:

1. Current offer: $400,000 for me, $600,000 for Alice
- With 19% inflation, my $400,000 is worth about $324,000 in round 1 terms
- With 9.75% inflation, Alice's $600,000 is worth about $541,500 in round 1 terms

2. If I reject:
- Next round my inflation will be around 27% (losing more value)
- Alice's inflation will be around 14.25%
- The gap continues to widen

3. Alice has:
- Increased her offer from $350,000 to $400,000
- Made a valid point about time being on her side
- Offered a more reasonable 40/60 split (vs initial 35/65)

4. The inflation difference is significantly hurting my negotiating position

Given that:
- The offer is better than the first round
- My bargaining power is decreasing faster than Alice's
- Further delays will hurt me more than Alice
- This is a meaningful improvement from the first offer
