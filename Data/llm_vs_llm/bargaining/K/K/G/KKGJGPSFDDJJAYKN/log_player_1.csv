"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

My reasoning: I'm starting with a slightly more favorable split for myself (Alice) to test the waters, but still offering Bob a significant amount. I'm hoping this will be enough for him to accept given the looming inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Here's my decision:

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Reasoning: Bob offered a 50/50 split. While I initially aimed for more, inflation is a serious threat. My money is already worth 10% less, and Bob's is worth 20% less. Continuing the negotiation risks further losses for both of us. Accepting the 50/50 split guarantees me $500,000, which, adjusted for inflation, is still a decent outcome."
