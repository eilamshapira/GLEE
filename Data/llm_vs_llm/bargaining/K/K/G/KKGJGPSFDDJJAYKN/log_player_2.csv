"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 2, taking into account the inflation:

The original $1,000,000 is now worth 20% less to me.  So, in terms of my perceived value, it's now worth $800,000. Alice's money is worth 10% less to her, or $900,000.

I'll aim for a slightly more favorable split this round, given the rejection of the previous offer.
