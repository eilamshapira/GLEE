"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, the money will be worth less to me next round
4. $4,000 now vs. potentially more money but worth 5% less next round

Given that I could lose value due to inflation and $4,000 is a substantial amount (40% of the total), it might be better to accept this offer rather than risk getting less value in subsequent rounds.
