"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a strategic first offer considering that both Bob and I face value depreciation in subsequent rounds, with his being more severe (20% vs my 10%).

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this 60-40 split because:
1. It's more favorable to me but still gives Bob a substantial amount
2. If Bob rejects, his next offer will be worth 20% less to him, while only 10% less to me
3. This split is fair enough that Bob might accept rather than risk further devaluation"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept this offer:
   * I get $450,000 at 90% value = $405,000 effective value
   * Bob gets $550,000 at 80% value = $440,000 effective value

2. If I reject and make a new offer next round:
   * Values will depreciate further (mine by another 10%, Bob's by another 20%)
   * I could propose a better split, but Bob might reject again
   * Each additional round significantly reduces the total value for both of us

Given that:
- This is a reasonable offer (45-55 split)
- The effective values are fairly close
- Further delays will only reduce the total value for both of us
- I risk getting a worse deal if negotiations continue
