0.0,10000.0,"Hi Bob, hereâ€™s my offer: you get the entire $10000 and I take nothing. Since with every new round my money loses 5% of its value while yours remains intact, waiting would only make my position worse and further strengthen your bargaining edge. I believe it's best for both of us to settle now. Please accept this offer.",Alice,1,
