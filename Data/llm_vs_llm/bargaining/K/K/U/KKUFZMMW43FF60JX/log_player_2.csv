"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, hereâ€™s my offer: you get the entire $10000 and I take nothing. Since with every new round my money loses 5% of its value while yours remains intact, waiting would only make my position worse and further strengthen your bargaining edge. I believe it's best for both of us to settle now. Please accept this offer. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:

1. She's offering me the entire $10,000
2. Her reasoning about inflation affecting her position is correct
3. This is literally the best possible outcome for me
4. There's no way I could get a better deal by rejecting and making a counter-offer
