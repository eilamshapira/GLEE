Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose an equal split which I think is fair for both of us. Since I face 5% inflation with each round, delaying agreement costs me more, but a 50-50 split represents true fairness. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
