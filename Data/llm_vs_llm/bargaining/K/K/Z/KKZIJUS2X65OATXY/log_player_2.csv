"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I believe this is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's offering me $40 out of the $100, while she takes $60. If I reject this offer, I'll get to make a counter-offer in the next round, but inflation will reduce the value of the money by 5% for me.

If I reject, the total amount would effectively be worth $95 to me in the next round. I could potentially get more than $40, but I need to weigh the risk versus the guaranteed $40 now.

Given that this is just the first round and I have a chance to make a counter-offer that might be more favorable to me, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more balanced while acknowledging the inflation factor that affects me.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I propose an equal split which I think is fair for both of us. Since I face 5% inflation with each round, delaying agreement costs me more, but a 50-50 split represents true fairness.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want to be fair, but the inflation hits me harder. Let's compromise - this offer still gives you almost half. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's new offer carefully. She's now offering me $45 out of $100, which is an improvement from her initial $40 offer. She's also revealed that inflation is affecting her more severely than it affects me (19% vs. 9.75% after two rounds).

If I reject this offer, we'll go to round 4 where I can make another counter-offer, but my inflation will increase to about 15% and hers would increase even more. 

Given that:
1. Alice has improved her offer substantially
2. The $45 I would receive now is worth more than potentially slightly more money in the next round due to inflation
3. Alice is suffering more from inflation than I am, which strengthens her incentive to reach an agreement
4. We're moving closer to a fair split

I think this is a reasonable compromise.
