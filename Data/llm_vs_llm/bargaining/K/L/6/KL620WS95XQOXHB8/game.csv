37.77,62.23,"Hi Bob, here’s my offer for Round 1. Based on a backward‐induction analysis with discounting (each round the $100 loses 10% of its value), if you reject this offer you’d become the proposer next round with a total of $90, and the equilibrium outcome there would give you approximately $62.23 anyway. So by accepting my offer now, you secure that same share while avoiding further discount. I’m offering $62.23 to you and keeping $37.77 for myself. I believe this is the fair equilibrium split. Let me know if you agree!",Alice,1,
