"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair on the surface. However, due to the 10% inflation penalty I face each round, waiting will reduce the value of my share. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount I receive will be worth 10% less to me.

Since this is the first round and the offer is an even split, it's reasonable to accept. If I reject, I might be able to negotiate for more in the next round, but the inflation would eat into my gains.
