"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer that's fair but also takes into account the different inflation rates we face.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

Since I'm affected by a 10% inflation rate per round while Bob faces a 20% inflation rate per round, it makes sense for us to reach an agreement quickly. My offer gives Bob a substantial portion while recognizing that I'm making the first proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I notice we're already in round 3, which means both of our potential earnings are diminishing with inflation. Let me make a more accommodating offer that reflects this reality.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

This is an equal split that should be fair to both of us. Since Bob faces a higher inflation rate (20% per round) compared to my 10%, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. A 50-50 split is a standard fair division that I hope Bob will accept."
