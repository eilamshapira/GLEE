550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a slightly favorable split for me since I face a 20% inflation penalty each round. This is fair because if we delay, the total value I can get decreases significantly. Let's agree now and both walk away with a good amount.",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I believe we can find a more equitable split.  I propose a 550/450 split, recognizing your inflation penalty but also ensuring a more balanced distribution.",Bob,2,

600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, I'm facing a significant disadvantage with the 20% inflation penalty each round. By round 3, any amount I receive is already worth considerably less to me than in round 1. I need to ask for 600k to offset this disadvantage. If we delay further, I'll need an even larger portion just to maintain the same effective value. This is a fair offer given the asymmetric inflation that only affects me.",Alice,3,
