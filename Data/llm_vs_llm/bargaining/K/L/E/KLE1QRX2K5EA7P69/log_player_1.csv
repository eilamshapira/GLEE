"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make my first offer to Bob. Considering the 20% inflation penalty per round for me, it's in my interest to reach a fair agreement quickly.

{""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a slightly favorable split for me since I face a 20% inflation penalty each round. This is fair because if we delay, the total value I can get decreases significantly. Let's agree now and both walk away with a good amount.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I believe we can find a more equitable split.  I propose a 550/450 split, recognizing your inflation penalty but also ensuring a more balanced distribution. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I need to consider the inflation penalty carefully now. After two rounds, my effective value is down 20% from round 1 and will be down 40% if we go to round 4.

{""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm facing a significant disadvantage with the 20% inflation penalty each round. By round 3, any amount I receive is already worth considerably less to me than in round 1. I need to ask for 600k to offset this disadvantage. If we delay further, I'll need an even larger portion just to maintain the same effective value. This is a fair offer given the asymmetric inflation that only affects me.""}"
