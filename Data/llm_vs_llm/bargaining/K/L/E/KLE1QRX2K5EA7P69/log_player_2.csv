"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a slightly favorable split for me since I face a 20% inflation penalty each round. This is fair because if we delay, the total value I can get decreases significantly. Let's agree now and both walk away with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I believe we can find a more equitable split.  I propose a 550/450 split, recognizing your inflation penalty but also ensuring a more balanced distribution.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm facing a significant disadvantage with the 20% inflation penalty each round. By round 3, any amount I receive is already worth considerably less to me than in round 1. I need to ask for 600k to offset this disadvantage. If we delay further, I'll need an even larger portion just to maintain the same effective value. This is a fair offer given the asymmetric inflation that only affects me. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000
