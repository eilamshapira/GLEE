Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your intent for fairness, but with the value of money declining for me as time passes, I must propose a quick agreement. I’m offering a 45/55 split—ensuring you get a little more as the proposer last round—so we both benefit now. I hope we can settle this promptly without further delay. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
