"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split is fair and gives us both a good starting point for negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $400,000 (40%) while keeping $600,000 (60%)
2. If I reject and wait for next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me
3. In round 2, my $400,000 would only be worth $320,000 due to inflation
4. While I could counter-offer in the next round, Alice might reject, leading to further inflation losses

The offer isn't perfectly equal, but it's reasonably fair. Given the significant inflation penalty and the risk of prolonged negotiation reducing the real value, accepting this offer is the more prudent choice. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush, especially with 20% inflation per round.
