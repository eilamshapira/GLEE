60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because inflation affects you more (20%) than me (10%) per round, so you benefit more from accepting early. If we drag this out, we both lose significantly.",Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, considering the higher impact of inflation on my side, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This way, we both get a reasonable share before the value drops too much. Let's settle this soon to maximize our gains.",Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"Bob, I've reconsidered and am offering you a better deal at 55-45 in my favor. This is still fair given the inflation rates, and we're both better off settling quickly rather than continuing to lose value. Let's conclude this now and both walk away with a good amount.",Alice,3,

50.0,50.0,"Alice, given the rapid decrease in value due to inflation, especially on my end, I'm proposing an equal split of 50-50. This is a fair compromise considering our different inflation rates, and it's crucial we settle soon to avoid further loss. Let's agree on this and end the game.",Bob,4,
