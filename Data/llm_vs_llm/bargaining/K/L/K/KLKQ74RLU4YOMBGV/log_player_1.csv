"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because inflation affects you more (20%) than me (10%) per round, so you benefit more from accepting early. If we drag this out, we both lose significantly.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the higher impact of inflation on my side, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This way, we both get a reasonable share before the value drops too much. Let's settle this soon to maximize our gains. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3

""bob_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Bob, I've reconsidered and am offering you a better deal at 55-45 in my favor. This is still fair given the inflation rates, and we're both better off settling quickly rather than continuing to lose value. Let's conclude this now and both walk away with a good amount.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, given the rapid decrease in value due to inflation, especially on my end, I'm proposing an equal split of 50-50. This is a fair compromise considering our different inflation rates, and it's crucial we settle soon to avoid further loss. Let's agree on this and end the game. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50
