"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because inflation affects you more (20%) than me (10%) per round, so you benefit more from accepting early. If we drag this out, we both lose significantly. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering the higher impact of inflation on my side, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This way, we both get a reasonable share before the value drops too much. Let's settle this soon to maximize our gains.""
}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I've reconsidered and am offering you a better deal at 55-45 in my favor. This is still fair given the inflation rates, and we're both better off settling quickly rather than continuing to lose value. Let's conclude this now and both walk away with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Alice, given the rapid decrease in value due to inflation, especially on my end, I'm proposing an equal split of 50-50. This is a fair compromise considering our different inflation rates, and it's crucial we settle soon to avoid further loss. Let's agree on this and end the game.""
