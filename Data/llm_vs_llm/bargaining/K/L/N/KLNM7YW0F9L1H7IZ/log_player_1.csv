Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it equally at 50/50. It's fair for both of us, and we ensure we walk away with an even share without worrying about inflation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
