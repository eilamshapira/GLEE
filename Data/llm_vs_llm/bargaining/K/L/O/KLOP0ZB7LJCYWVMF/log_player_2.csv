"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. 

Alice is proposing I get $40 while she gets $60. If I reject and we go to the next round, the total value decreases by 10% for me due to inflation. So the $100 would be worth only $90 to me in the next round, meaning even if I got all of it (which is unlikely), I'd only effectively get $90.

If I make a counter-offer, Alice might reject it too, and we could lose more value in subsequent rounds. Getting $40 now is better than potentially getting nothing or a depreciated amount later.
