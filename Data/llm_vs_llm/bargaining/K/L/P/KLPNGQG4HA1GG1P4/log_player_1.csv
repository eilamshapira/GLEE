"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, given the potential for inflation.  Let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll calculate the actual value I'd get:

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I'll get 95% of the proposed $450,000, which is approximately $427,500.

Given this, I think I can do better. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth even less now. 

For me, the money is worth 95% * 95% = 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025 of the original value.
For Bob, the money is worth 90% * 90% = 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 of the original value.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 650000, 
""bob_gain"": 350000, 
""message"": ""Inflation is kicking in, let's make a deal before it's too late!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise. I'm willing to take a smaller share to avoid further inflation. A 40/60 split seems fair right now. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value I'd get, considering the inflation:

The money I gain is worth 100% - 14.26% = 85.74% of the original value.
So, I'll get 85.74% of the proposed $600,000, which is approximately $514,440.

Given this, I think Bob's offer is reasonable, and I don't want to risk further inflation.
