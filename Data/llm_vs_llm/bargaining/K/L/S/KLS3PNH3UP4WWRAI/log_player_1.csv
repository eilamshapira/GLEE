"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid inflation losses""
}
```

I'm proposing a fair split of $50 each, hoping Bob will accept to avoid the effects of inflation in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be realistic, I'm taking on more risk with inflation. This is a fair offer. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effects, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $40, but its value will be 10% less than the original $40 due to inflation. So, the effective value I'll get is $40 * 0.9 = $36.

On the other hand, if I reject this offer, the money will be worth even less in the next round. Since I don't know the exact inflation effect on Bob, I'll have to make a decision based on my own inflation rate.

Given that Bob's offer is not extremely unfair and considering the inflation effects, I'll accept this offer to avoid further losses.
