"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me 4000$ out of 10,000$, which is 40% of the total. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 5% less to me (so the total value for me would be 9500$).

While 4000$ is less than half, it's still a significant amount. If I reject, the maximum I could reasonably hope to get next round would be about 5700$ (60% of 9500$), but Alice might reject that, leading to further rounds and more inflation.

Given:
1. The certainty of getting 4000$ now
2. The risk of getting less in future rounds due to inflation
3. The possibility of ending up with nothing if we can't agree in 12 rounds
4. The fact that this is a decent first offer (40% is not unfair)

I'll accept this offer.
