I'll start with a very generous offer, hoping to get this over with quickly. I'll take 999,000 and give Bob 1,000.  Let's see if he's willing to accept."

I'm going to counter Bob's offer. Given the inflation, I'm taking a significant cut, but I'm still offering him a decent amount. Let's see if he's willing to accept."

Round 7

I'm going for an even split.  Inflation has taken a significant toll, and we're approaching the deadline. A 50/50 split seems like the fairest way to go at this point."
