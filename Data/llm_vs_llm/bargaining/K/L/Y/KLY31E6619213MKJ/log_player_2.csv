"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer:
- She's proposing a perfectly equal split of the $10,000: $5,000 for each of us.
- This is a fair division that gives us equal shares.
- While I could try to negotiate for more in the next round, the equal split is reasonable and fair.
- There's always risk in rejecting a fair offer, as negotiations could break down in later rounds.
