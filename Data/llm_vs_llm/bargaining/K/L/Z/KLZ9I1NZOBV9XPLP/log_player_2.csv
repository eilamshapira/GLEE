"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly and avoid inflation losses 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

A 50-50 split is generally considered fair, and Alice makes a valid point about avoiding inflation losses. If I reject:
1. The money will be worth 10% less to me next round (so $10,000 becomes $9,000)
2. I could propose a higher split in my favor, but Alice might reject
3. We could end up in a back-and-forth that costs us both through inflation

Given it's the first round and the offer is fair, accepting now guarantees me $5,000 with no inflation loss. Trying to negotiate for more could leave me with less due to inflation or risk getting nothing if we can't agree within 12 rounds.
