"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose I get $60 and you get $40. This is a fair split considering the inflation risk. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. However, due to 10% inflation, any amount I get in the next round will be worth 10% less
4. If I get $40 now, it's worth $40
5. To get the same value in the next round, I'd need to secure at least $44.44 ($40 รท 0.9)
6. There's no guarantee Alice would accept a better offer from me

Given the inflation risk and the reasonable nature of the current offer (40% is not terrible), I'll accept.
