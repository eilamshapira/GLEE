"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me 4500$ out of 10000$
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 5% less to me
3. 5% of 4500$ is 225$, so next round my money would be worth less
4. 4500$ is a decent offer (45% of the total)
5. Rejecting might lead to a back-and-forth that reduces value through inflation
