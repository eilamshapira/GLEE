"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose an equal 50-50 split which is fair to both of us. We'd both get $500000. If we continue negotiating, we'll both lose money due to the 5% inflation per round, so this is the most optimal solution for both parties. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
