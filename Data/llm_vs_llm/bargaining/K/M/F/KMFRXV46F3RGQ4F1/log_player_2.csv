"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split it reasonably. This offer gives you a substantial amount while considering the value decrease over rounds. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if this is a fair deal, taking into account the inflation factor and potential future negotiation.

Alice is offering me $400,000 while taking $600,000 for herself. This is not an equal split. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, I should consider that the total value will decrease by 5% to $950,000. 

Given that this is not a 50-50 split and I'll have the opportunity to make a proposal next round despite the 5% inflation, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""I propose an equal 50-50 split which is fair to both of us. We'd both get $500,000. If we continue negotiating, we'll both lose money due to the 5% inflation per round, so this is the most optimal solution for both parties.""}"
