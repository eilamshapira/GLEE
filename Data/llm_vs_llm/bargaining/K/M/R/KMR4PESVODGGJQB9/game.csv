550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a fair split that accounts for the inflation factor. Since the money loses 10% of its value for me each round but not for you, I'm proposing I get 55% and you get 45%. This is fair because if we go to the next round, the total value decreases for me but stays the same for you, so we both benefit by agreeing now rather than later.",Alice,1,

500000.0,500000.0,"Hey Alice, I understand the inflation concern you have, but let's go with an equal split of 50/50. This way, we both walk away with a sizable amount fairly. This offer equally values both our positions without worrying about any inflation factors.",Bob,2,

600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, you need to understand that inflation affects me directly. If we continue this pattern of rejections, I lose value each round while you don't. The fair solution must account for this asymmetric risk. At this point, I've already lost 19% effective value (10% in round 2, and another 10% of the remaining 90% now). I'm proposing a 60/40 split which acknowledges this reality. If we don't agree now, we both risk losing more in continued negotiations.",Alice,3,

480000.0,520000.0,"Alice, I see how the decreasing value impacts your end. However, I've taken a slight adjustment in my offer to acknowledge your inflation losses. I'm offering you $480000, which allows us to close the deal at a reasonable point.  Further delays will continue to harm your value — let’s make a fair compromise now.",Bob,4,

650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, we're now in round 5, and I've lost over 34% of my effective value due to inflation (10% compounded each round). Your slight adjustment to 48/52 doesn't adequately account for this significant loss. At this point, I need 65% just to receive roughly the same effective value as a 50/50 split would have given me in round 1. This isn't greed - it's mathematics. The longer we negotiate, the more unfavorable any split becomes for me, while you lose nothing to inflation. Please accept this offer so we can both walk away with fair value.",Alice,5,
