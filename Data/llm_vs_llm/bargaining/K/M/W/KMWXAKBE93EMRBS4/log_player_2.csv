"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share, considering inflation 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether I should accept this offer, I need to consider the value of the money after inflation. Since the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, and this is the first round, I'll calculate the value for the next round to decide if I should hold out for a potentially better offer.

In the first round, the offer is $40 for me and $60 for Alice. If I reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, the total amount will be worth 20% less to me and 10% less to Alice.

However, considering this is the first offer and it already gives Alice a larger share, I should evaluate if pushing for a potentially more equal split in the next round is worth the risk of losing 20% of the value for me.

Given that the offer is not extremely in my favor but also considering the significant drop in value for me in subsequent rounds, I might want to consider accepting this offer to avoid further devaluation.
