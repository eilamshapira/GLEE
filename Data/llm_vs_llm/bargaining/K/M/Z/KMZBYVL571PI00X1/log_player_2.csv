"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose an even split right away â€“ $500000 for you and $500000 for me. This way we both avoid the inflation penalty and secure the full value of the money now. I look forward to a swift agreement! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice proposes an equal 50-50 split ($500,000 each)
2. If I reject, the next round will have 5% inflation for me, meaning my share would need to be at least $525,000 to be better than this offer
3. There's no guarantee Alice would accept such a higher offer in the next round
4. This is a fair and reasonable first offer that treats us both equally
5. Accepting now means I avoid any inflation penalty

Given these factors, this is actually a good offer. If I reject, I would need to secure significantly more in the next round to offset the 5% inflation loss, which might be difficult to achieve. The risk of losing value through inflation outweighs the potential benefit of negotiating for more.
