"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Since Alice's money loses 5% value each round, and mine doesn't lose value:

* Current offer: I get $50, Alice gets $50
* If we go to next round:
  * I could offer something like $60/$40
  * For Alice, her $40 would actually be worth $38 (5% less)
  * She might still reject, leading to more rounds and more value loss for her

I can leverage this time pressure to get a better deal, so I'll reject this even split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice faces a 5% loss in value each round, I'll propose a split that's slightly in my favor, but not so aggressive that she's likely to reject it and go to another round (where her money would be worth even less).

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I propose this 60/40 split because:
1. For Alice, $40 now is better than potentially getting less value in future rounds due to the 5% depreciation
2. It's not so unfair that it would trigger a rejection based on fairness principles
3. If she rejects, her next counter-offer would be worth less to her, giving me leverage"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 62 
# Alice gain: 38 
Do you accept this offer?","This is an interesting offer from Alice. Let me analyze:

1. I'm being offered $62, which is actually better than my previous proposal of $60
2. Alice is offering herself $38, which at 9.75% inflation is worth about $34.30 to her
3. If I reject:
   * We go to next round where her money loses even more value (14.75%)
   * I could try for more, but she's already made a reasonable concession
   * There's risk she might make a worse offer in frustration

Since this offer is better than what I proposed last round, and the inflation pressure is clearly affecting Alice's decision-making, I should accept this offer.
