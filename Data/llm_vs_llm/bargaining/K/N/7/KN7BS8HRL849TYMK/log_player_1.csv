I'm trying to find a middle ground.  I'm increasing my share again, but still leaving Bob with a significant portion, hoping we can reach an agreement before further inflation erodes our gains."

This is a tough decision, as the inflation has significantly impacted the value of the money. However, I'm accepting Bob's offer because I'm worried that rejecting it could lead to even less money for me in future rounds."
