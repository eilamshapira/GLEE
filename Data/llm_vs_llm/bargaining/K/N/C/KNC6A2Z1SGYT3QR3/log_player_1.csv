"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Split it evenly, fair for both""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's make a deal. I think this split is a good starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I need to consider that when evaluating Bob's offer.

Bob's offer: I gain $4000, but due to inflation, it's worth 20% less, so it's effectively worth $4000 * 0.8 = $3200.

Considering this, I think I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less in each round, I need to make a more favorable offer to myself to compensate for the inflation.

In Round 1, the money was worth 100% of its value.
In Round 2, the money was worth 80% of its value (due to 20% inflation).
In Round 3, the money is worth 64% of its value (80% * 0.8).

With that in mind, here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this split is more reasonable for me""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I need you to meet me closer to my previous offer.  This is a fair deal considering the money is losing value. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I need to consider that when evaluating Bob's offer.

The money has lost 20% of its value in Round 2, and another 20% of the remaining 80% in Round 3, and another 20% of the remaining 64% in Round 4. 
So, the value is 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.512, or 51.2% of the original value.

Bob's offer: I gain $4500, but due to inflation, it's worth 51.2% of its original value, so it's effectively worth $4500 * 0.512 = $2304.

Considering this, I think I should reject the offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money I gain is worth 51.2% of its original value in Round 4, and it will lose another 20% of its value in Round 5, I need to make a more favorable offer to myself to compensate for the inflation.

In Round 5, the money is worth 40.96% of its original value (51.2% * 0.8).

With that in mind, here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a larger share to account for the significant loss in value""
}
```"
