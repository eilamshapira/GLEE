Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this split is more reasonable for me 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is getting worse for me with each round. It's time to signal I'm serious about getting a better deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm taking a larger share to account for the significant loss in value 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This offer is terrible for me, but it's only going to get worse from here.  If I reject it, I risk getting even less in future rounds. It's better to take the sure loss now than risk a larger one."
