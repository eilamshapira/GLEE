"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the situation. The value of the money has decreased due to inflation.

Considering the offer and the impact of inflation:

*   **My perspective (Alice):** I would be gaining $40, but each dollar is worth 10% less. So, in terms of Round 1 value, it's like receiving $40 * 0.90 = $36.
*   **Bob's perspective:** Bob is gaining $60, but each dollar is worth 20% less than in round 1.

Given this, and considering we are already in round 2 and potentially losing value each round, I will:

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
