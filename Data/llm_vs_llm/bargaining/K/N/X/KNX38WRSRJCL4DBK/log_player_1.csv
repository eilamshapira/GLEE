"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Alright, I'll make my first offer to Bob. I'll propose a fair split.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split of the $1,000,000, which gives us each $500,000. This is a fair division that respects both of our interests equally."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll adjust my approach based on what I've observed. Bob seems to want more than a 50-50 split.

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}

I propose giving Bob $550,000 and myself $450,000. Since I noticed Bob is affected by inflation (his money is worth 5% less each round), this offer gives him more upfront to account for that disadvantage while still ensuring I receive a fair portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I see that Bob is continuing to request a larger share, likely due to the increasing inflation effect on his gains. I'll make a more accommodating offer.

{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}

I propose giving Bob $600,000 and myself $400,000. This accounts for the increasing inflation penalty Bob faces (now at 14.26% compared to round 1), while still securing a reasonable amount for myself. This matches what Bob offered in round 2, showing I'm willing to accept those terms now."
