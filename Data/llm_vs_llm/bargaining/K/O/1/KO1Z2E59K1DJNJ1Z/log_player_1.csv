"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a proposal for the first round, considering the different inflation rates for both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose we divide the $100 with $60 for me and $40 for you, Bob. This is a fair offer considering that inflation will impact me more heavily than you if we continue to later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
