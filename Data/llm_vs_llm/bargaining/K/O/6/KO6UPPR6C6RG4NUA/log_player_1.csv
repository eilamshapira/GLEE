"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me make a fair first offer, considering that inflation will affect future rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose a slightly higher share for myself since I need to account for the 10% inflation penalty per round if Bob declines. This offer still gives Bob a substantial portion while protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $525,000 at 90% value = $472,500 effective value
- If I reject and propose next round, any amount I get will be worth only 80% of the original value
- Bob's offer is fairly reasonable, giving me a majority share
- Continuing to negotiate means risking further value loss
- We've already lost two rounds, and have 10 left
- The difference between our shares is $50,000 which is reasonable

Given these factors, especially the accelerating inflation on my side, I'll accept this offer.
