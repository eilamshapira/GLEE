3776.68,6223.32,"Hi Bob, I propose the following division: I take $3776.68 and you get $6223.32 from the full $10000. Given that with each round the total amount depreciates by 10%, waiting won’t improve either of our outcomes—indeed, if you reject, you’ll eventually be in the position of proposing in Round 2, but even then your best attainable share (after backward‐induction) equals roughly $6223.32. Accepting now maximizes our returns before further devaluation. What do you think?",Alice,1,
