"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since this is the first round and I want to make a fair but advantageous offer, considering the 20% inflation penalty for each rejected round, I'll propose a slightly favorable split for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this split of 60-40 because:
1. It's generous enough that Bob might accept it
2. If Bob rejects, my next opportunity will be worth 20% less to me
3. A more aggressive split might lead to multiple rounds of negotiation, which would hurt me due to inflation"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept:
   * I get $450,000 Ã— 0.8 = $360,000 (in round 1 value)
   * Bob gets $550,000

2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make a new offer
   * But it will be worth another 20% less to me
   * That means only 64% of the original value
   * Even if I got the whole million in round 3, it would be worth $640,000 to me

Given that:
1. The offer gives me $360,000 in effective value
2. Rejecting would mean even more value loss due to inflation
3. The risk of further negotiations could leave me worse off
