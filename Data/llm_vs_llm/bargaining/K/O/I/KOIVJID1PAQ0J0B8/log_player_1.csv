"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose we split the money 60-40, giving me $600,000 and Bob $400,000. This is a fair offer that gives both of us a substantial amount, while acknowledging my position as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer. Since Bob's money is worth 20% less this round, his $500,000 is actually worth $400,000 to him. I know my money maintains its value, so I can likely get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round. Also, Bob rejected my fairly generous first offer, so I should negotiate for a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}

I propose a 65-35 split. Given that Bob's money is experiencing inflation while mine isn't, this split would still give Bob a meaningful portion while maximizing the overall utility of the money. Since time is passing and inflation is affecting Bob's share, we should try to reach an agreement soon to prevent further value loss."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer. With Bob's inflation at 48.8%, his $550,000 is only worth about $281,600 to him. Since my money maintains its value and I'm being offered less than half, this isn't an optimal deal for me. I can make a better counter-offer in the next round, especially considering that Bob's inflation will continue to increase, which should make him more motivated to reach an agreement soon."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

I propose a 70-30 split. Given that Bob's money is now suffering from significant inflation (48.8% in the last round), we need to reach an agreement soon before his share loses even more value. This split would give Bob $300,000, which is still a substantial amount even after inflation, while recognizing the fact that my money retains its full value. The increasing inflation should make this offer more appealing to Bob than continuing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer. With Bob's inflation at 67.23%, his $600,000 is only worth about $196,620 to him. Meanwhile, I'm being offered $400,000 which is significantly less than previous offers and my money maintains its full value. The high inflation rate affecting Bob's share should make him more willing to reach an agreement soon, so I can make a more favorable counter-offer in the next round. Additionally, with only 6 rounds left, we need to be mindful of reaching an agreement before both of us get nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}

I propose a 75-25 split. With Bob's money now worth 67.23% less than at the start, we need to reach an agreement quickly. Even though I'm offering Bob $250,000, given the current inflation rate, further delays will only decrease the real value of his share even more. We also only have 5 rounds left before we both get nothing, so this is a reasonable offer considering the circumstances. The declining value of Bob's share and the time pressure should make this offer more attractive than continuing negotiations."
