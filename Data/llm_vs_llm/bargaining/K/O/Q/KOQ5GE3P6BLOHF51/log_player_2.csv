"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split where I get a modest majority of 55%. This acknowledges both our roles in the negotiation while keeping things reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me 450,000$
2. If I reject and we go to the next round:
   * The total value will be worth 10% less to me
   * Maximum I could get would be 900,000$ (1M - 10%)
   * But Alice would need to accept my offer
   * If she rejects, the value drops another 10%

While the split isn't perfectly equal, 450,000$ is a substantial amount. Given the risk of inflation and potential for a prolonged negotiation that could reduce the value significantly, this is actually a reasonable offer.

If I reject, I'd need to make an offer that's both better for me AND acceptable to Alice, which might be difficult. The 10% inflation penalty makes waiting risky.
