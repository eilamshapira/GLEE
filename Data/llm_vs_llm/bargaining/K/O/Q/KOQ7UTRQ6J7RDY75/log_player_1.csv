"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair offer considering the inflation effect.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose a slight advantage for myself since I know inflation will reduce the value of money for me in future rounds. This is a reasonable split that gives Bob a substantial portion while accounting for my potential future losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
