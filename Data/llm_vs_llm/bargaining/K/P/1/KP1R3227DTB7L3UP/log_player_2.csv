"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:
1. Current offer: $40 for me
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 10% inflation, each round makes my money worth less
4. If I reject now, in the next round $100 will only be worth $90 to me
5. A fair division would be 50-50, but I need to factor in inflation
6. $40 now is better than potentially getting $45 (50% of $90) next round
