"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering whether to accept Alice's first offer of a 50-50 split. Let me analyze the situation:

1) The offer splits the $10,000 evenly: $5,000 for me and $5,000 for Alice.
2) If I reject, we move to round 2 where I can make an offer.
3) With inflation, money loses 5% value for Alice each round, but maintains full value for me.
4) This dynamic gives me increasing leverage in later rounds.

Since the money maintains full value for me, but decreases in value for Alice each round, I believe I can propose a more favorable split in round 2. Alice should be more willing to accept a lesser amount in later rounds due to inflation affecting her.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a strategic offer that accounts for the inflation pressure on Alice. Since each round reduces the value of money by 5% for Alice but not for me, I'll propose a split that's more favorable to me but still reasonable enough that Alice might accept rather than risk further rounds of inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200}

I'm offering Alice $4,200 which is still substantial but recognizes my advantage in the inflation dynamic. This is a fair proposal considering that if we continue to later rounds, Alice's potential gains will be worth less to her due to the 5% inflation she faces each round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer in round 3:

1) Alice is now offering me $5,500 and keeping $4,500 for herself.
2) This is a better deal for me than her initial 50-50 split.
3) The inflation effect means Alice's $4,500 is actually worth about 9.75% less to her than it would have been in round 1.
4) If I reject, we move to round 4 where I can make an offer, and Alice will face even more inflation (about 15% compared to round 1).

While I could reject and try for an even better deal in round 4, Alice has moved significantly in my direction. The $5,500 offer is a reasonable improvement from her initial offer. If I get too greedy, we risk running through all 12 rounds and both getting nothing.

Given that Alice has shown willingness to compromise, and I've already secured a better-than-equal share, I'll accept this offer.
