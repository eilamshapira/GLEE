"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want a larger share, so I'm willing to be generous.  Let's split $5500 for you and $4500 for me.  This offer won't be as good after another round of inflation, especially for you. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
