"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's keep it simple and fair by splitting the $10000 equally. How about 50/50? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With a 50/50 split, I would get $5,000. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the money will be worth 10% less to me, meaning my portion would need to be at least $5,556 in the next round just to match the current offer's value ($5,000 ÷ 0.9 ≈ $5,556).

While I could try to negotiate for more, there's a risk Alice would reject my counter-offer, leading to further rounds and more value loss due to inflation. Since this is a fair opening offer and the inflation penalty makes waiting costly for me, I should accept.
