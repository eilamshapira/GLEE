4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but that's exactly why we should finish this now. If we keep going to more rounds, your share loses 20% value each time. This 60/40 split is fair given our different inflation rates - you get $4000 now which is worth more to you than potentially less in future rounds. Let's conclude this efficiently.",Bob,2,

4800.0,5200.0,"Bob, I understand your point, but I still need to consider the inflation impact on me. Let's settle for a 48/52 split. This way, I get a bit more than your previous offer, and we can both walk away with a fair share.",Alice,3,
