Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but that's exactly why we should finish this now. If we keep going to more rounds, your share loses 20% value each time. This 60/40 split is fair given our different inflation rates - you get $4000 now which is worth more to you than potentially less in future rounds. Let's conclude this efficiently. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000
