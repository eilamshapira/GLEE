"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the money with me getting 5500 and you getting 4500. This way, we both get a fair share, considering the inflation affect me more than you. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice's proposal gives her a slightly larger share, it's not unreasonable given that she faces 20% inflation per round while I face 0%. If I reject and we go to another round, her money would be worth less, which might lead to a more aggressive stance from her.

I'll evaluate this offer: I get $4,500 right now with certainty, which is 45% of the total. If I reject, I could propose a better split for myself in the next round, but Alice might reject it, leading to further rounds and potentially worse outcomes.

Given that I don't face inflation pressure while Alice does, I think I can negotiate a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that Alice faces 20% inflation per round while I don't, I have a stronger negotiating position. I'll propose a split that acknowledges this dynamic but still gives Alice a reasonable amount.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, 
""alice_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but that's exactly why we should finish this now. If we keep going to more rounds, your share loses 20% value each time. This 60/40 split is fair given our different inflation rates - you get $4,000 now which is worth more to you than potentially less in future rounds. Let's conclude this efficiently.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point, but I still need to consider the inflation impact on me. Let's settle for a 48/52 split. This way, I get a bit more than your previous offer, and we can both walk away with a fair share. 
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is now proposing I get $5,200 (52% of the total), which is better than her first offer of $4,500. She's meeting me partway between her initial proposal and mine.

Important considerations:
- Alice is facing 36% inflation at this point, meaning her $4,800 is worth significantly less to her than it would have been in round 1
- If I reject, we go to round 4, where I make an offer, but her inflation increases to around 49%
- This offer gives me more than half of the total amount

This is a significantly better offer for me than the first round, and if we continue negotiating, Alice might become more desperate due to inflation, but also potentially more stubborn.

Given that I'm already getting more than half of the money and Alice has moved substantially in my direction, I'll accept this offer.
