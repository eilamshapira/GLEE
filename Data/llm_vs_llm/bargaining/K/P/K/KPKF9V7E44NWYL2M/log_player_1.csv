"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a division that accounts for the time pressure I face due to inflation. Since I'm starting first, I'll make a reasonable offer that Bob should find acceptable.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose this split because while I want a fair share, I also need to account for the 20% inflation penalty I'll face if we go to another round. A 55-45 split is favorable enough for me while still being fair enough that Bob should seriously consider accepting it."
