"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The offer seems fair with a 50-50 split. However, I need to consider the inflation effect. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value will be worth 10% less to me. This means even if I could get more in the next round, I need to weigh that against the guaranteed $50 now.

Given the equal split and the certainty of avoiding inflation, I'll accept this offer.
