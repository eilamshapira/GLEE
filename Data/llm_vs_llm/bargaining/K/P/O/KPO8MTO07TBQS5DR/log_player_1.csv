"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to avoid value loss from inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering inflation, I think a 55-45 split is more reasonable, taking into account the decreasing value of money for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
* My $45 is now worth $40.5 due to 10% inflation
* Bob's $55 is worth $52.25 due to 5% inflation

If I reject and we go to the next round:
* Further inflation will reduce values (another 10% for me, 5% for Bob)
* I could propose a higher split, but Bob might reject again
* The total value we're splitting keeps decreasing

Since $40.5 is still a significant portion and waiting will only decrease the money's value further, I should accept this offer.
