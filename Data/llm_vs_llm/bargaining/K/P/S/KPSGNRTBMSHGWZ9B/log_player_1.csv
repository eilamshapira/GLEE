"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me make a reasonable first offer that gives both of us a good share while accounting for the risk of inflation if negotiations drag on.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this 60-40 split because I'm making the first move and taking initiative, but I still want to leave Bob with a substantial portion to increase chances of acceptance. This gives me $6,000 and Bob $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Bob wants $5500 for himself and offers me $4500. Due to inflation:
- My $4500 is worth: $4500 * 0.95 = $4275
- Bob's $5500 is worth: $5500 * 0.8 = $4400

While this split favors Bob slightly, the inflation will only get worse in future rounds, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal later. Making a counter-offer means both amounts will be worth even less in the next round.
