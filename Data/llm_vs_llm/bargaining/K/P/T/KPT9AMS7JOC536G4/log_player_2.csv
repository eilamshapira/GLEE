"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With $40 out of $100, that's a 40-60 split. While not exactly equal, it's not terribly unfair.

If I reject, the next round will have 20% inflation for me, meaning any amount I get will be worth 20% less. So if I were to get $50 in the next round, it would only be worth $40 to me.

Given that:
1. The offer is reasonable
2. Inflation will hurt my position in future rounds
3. There's no guarantee Alice will accept a better offer from me
4. We risk getting nothing if we can't agree in 12 rounds
