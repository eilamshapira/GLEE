"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that I'm playing as Alice and need to consider the 20% depreciation per round if my offer is rejected, I'll make a reasonable first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose this split because:
1. It's a fair majority share for me as the first mover
2. It leaves Bob with a significant portion
3. If Bob rejects it, any money I get in later rounds will be worth less to me due to the 20% depreciation"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer:
1. Due to 20% inflation, if I accept $50 now, it's effectively worth $40 to me ($50 * 0.8)
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer, any amount I get will be worth even less (another 20% reduction)
3. Bob's 50-50 split is objectively fair, and given the inflation penalty I face, this is probably the best realistic outcome I can expect
