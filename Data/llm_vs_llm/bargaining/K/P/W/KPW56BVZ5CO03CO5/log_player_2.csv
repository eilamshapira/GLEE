"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $2,000 while she gets $8,000, which is only 20% of the total for me. With inflation reducing the value by 10% each round for me, waiting has costs. However, this first offer is quite uneven, and I'll have the chance to make a counter-offer next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more balanced division while acknowledging the time pressure from inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I suggest a more equitable split where I receive $5,500 and you receive $4,500. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement soon, as inflation is decreasing the value for me with each round. This division recognizes both our interests and offers you a substantial portion while being significantly more balanced than your initial proposal."
