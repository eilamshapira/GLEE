"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a split that takes into account the inflation penalty for future rounds. Since I lose 20% value per round and Bob only loses 10%, it's in my interest to make a reasonable first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this split: $6,000 for me (Alice) and $4,000 for Bob. This is a 60-40 split which is favorable to me but still gives Bob a significant portion. If Bob rejects this, in the next round the total value will be worth less for both of us, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Due to inflation, for me:
   * $4,500 × 0.8 = $3,600 effective value

2. For Bob:
   * $5,500 × 0.9 = $4,950 effective value

3. If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 3:
   * Values will decrease further (I'll lose another 20%, Bob another 10%)
   * The total pie will be worth even less for both of us
   * There's no guarantee Bob will accept my next offer

While this offer gives Bob more than me, the inflation penalty means delaying further will cost me more than it costs Bob. Getting $3,600 in effective value now is better than risking further devaluation.
