"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate this offer carefully.

Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000, meaning she gets $6,000. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value will decrease by 10% for me (worth $9,000 to me) and 20% for Alice (worth $8,000 to her).

If I reject now, I could propose a more favorable split next round. Since Alice's money would devalue more quickly than mine, she has a stronger incentive to reach an agreement sooner.

Since this is just the first round and I believe I can get a better deal considering our different inflation rates, I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a strategic offer that takes into account our different inflation rates. Since the money is worth 10% less to me and 20% less to Alice in each round, Alice has a stronger incentive to reach an agreement quickly.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I believe this is a fair offer considering our different time preferences. If Alice rejects this offer, we'll move to round 3 where the $10,000 would be worth even less to both of us, but especially to Alice (worth only 64% of the original value to her versus 81% to me). This gives her a rational reason to accept this split now rather than holding out for more in future rounds."
