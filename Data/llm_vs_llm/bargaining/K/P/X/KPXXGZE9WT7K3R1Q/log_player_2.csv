"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
* I'm being offered $450,000
* If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me
* After inflation, if I get even $500,000 next round, it would only be worth $400,000 to me
* Alice is offering a fairly reasonable split (45%-55%)
* The risk of losing value due to inflation outweighs the potential gain from negotiating
