"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a fair split considering the inflation impact. You'll get $4000 now, which is better than waiting and losing value due to 5% inflation per round. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, but I need to secure more for myself to compensate for the inflation. Let's reach a deal that benefits us both.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Consider this offer carefully. With 5% inflation per round, your $4500 now is worth more than a larger amount in future rounds. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our positions. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
