"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I'll be Alice and make an offer in JSON format.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

My reasoning: I'm starting with a relatively favorable offer for myself, considering the inflation factor that affects me and not Bob (as far as I know). I'm hoping Bob will accept this to avoid the risk of the money losing value in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Now the money is worth 5% less for me.

Let's calculate the worth of Bob's offer for me: 5000 * 0.95 = 4750

And the worth of the money for Bob: 5000

I will accept the offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
