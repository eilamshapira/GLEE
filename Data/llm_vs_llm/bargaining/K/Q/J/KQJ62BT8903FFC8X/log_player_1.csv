Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's keep it simple and fair: a 50/50 split. No need to risk further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Let me explain my reasoning: While this offer gives me slightly less than what I proposed ($500,000 vs. $550,000), due to the 10% inflation penalty, if I reject this offer, my next possible gain would already be worth 10% less. Additionally, there's no guarantee that Bob would accept my next offer, which could lead to further rounds and more inflation penalties for me. Since this is a fair 50/50 split and I know my position gets worse with each round due to inflation, accepting now is the rational choice."
