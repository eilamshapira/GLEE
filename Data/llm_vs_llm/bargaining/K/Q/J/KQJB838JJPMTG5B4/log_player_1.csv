"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your point about inflation rates, but let's start with a fair 50-50 split. We both lose by delaying - you more than me due to your higher inflation rate. This equal split respects both our positions and allows us to conclude quickly. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50
