"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40. It's a fair start considering the inflation rates affect me more. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I take $40 while she takes $60. She's justifying this split based on our different inflation rates (mine is 5% per round, hers is 10% per round).

If I reject and we go to the next round, I can make my own proposal, but the total money will be worth less to both of us. For me, the $100 would be worth $95 in the next round, while for Alice it would be worth $90.

Given that I have the lower inflation rate and we have multiple rounds available, it might be strategic to make a counter-proposal where I could potentially get more than $40.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that considers our different inflation rates while being more balanced.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""I understand your point about inflation rates, but let's start with a fair 50-50 split. We both lose by delaying - you more than me due to your higher inflation rate. This equal split respects both our positions and allows us to conclude quickly.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. I understand your concern about fairness, but I need to consider the higher inflation rate on my side. This split should be more acceptable to both of us. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this new offer carefully. Alice is now offering me $45 while she takes $55, which is a move toward the middle from her initial 40-60 split.

The inflation is already affecting both of us. For me, whatever I receive is now worth 9.75% less than in round 1, and for Alice, it's 19% less.

If I reject again:
- We go to round 4
- My inflation increases to around 15% (vs. round 1)
- Alice's inflation increases to around 27% (vs. round 1)

The gap between our inflation rates is widening, which gives me some leverage, but also means the total value continues to decrease for both of us.

Alice has moved 5% in my direction. This offer is more reasonable, and considering the mounting inflation, it makes sense to accept rather than risk further devaluation.
