550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I'm willing to compromise from my initial offer, but I need more than 45% due to my higher inflation rate (20% per round vs your 5%). This 55-45 split in my favor helps balance our inflation risks. Let's agree and avoid further value loss for both of us.",Alice,3,

420000.0,580000.0,"Alice, I understand your inflation rate is higher, but I'm also taking a risk by delaying the agreement. Given the current situation, I think a 58-42 split is a fair compromise, considering the value I've already lost and the potential for further losses.",Bob,4,
