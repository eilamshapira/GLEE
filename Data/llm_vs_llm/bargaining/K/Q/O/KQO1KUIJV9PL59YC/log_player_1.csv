"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think a 55-45 split is more reasonable, considering the risk of inflation and the need for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
""decision"": ""reject""
}

The inflation impact on my side is too severe (20% loss means I'd effectively get only 360,000$), and I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to compromise from my initial offer, but I need more than 45% due to my higher inflation rate (20% per round vs your 5%). This 55-45 split in my favor helps balance our inflation risks. Let's agree and avoid further value loss for both of us.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your inflation rate is higher, but I'm also taking a risk by delaying the agreement. Given the current situation, I think a 58-42 split is a fair compromise, considering the value I've already lost and the potential for further losses. 
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
""decision"": ""accept""
}

I'll accept this offer. With my 48.8% inflation, I'll effectively get around $215,040, and waiting longer will only decrease my potential gains further due to the high inflation rate affecting me. While not ideal, this is better than risking further rounds where my effective gains would be even lower."
