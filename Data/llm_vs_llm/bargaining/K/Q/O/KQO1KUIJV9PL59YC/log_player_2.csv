Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get a substantial amount right away without risking inflation losses.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to compromise from my initial offer, but I need more than 45% due to my higher inflation rate (20% per round vs your 5%). This 55-45 split in my favor helps balance our inflation risks. Let's agree and avoid further value loss for both of us.
