400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, thank you for your previous proposal. Since I'm making the offer this round, I propose a division where I receive $600000 and you receive $400000. I believe this division is fair given the dynamics of our negotiation and the fact that both of us would benefit from reaching an agreement now rather than prolonging the process. I hope you agree and we can both move forward.",Bob,2,
