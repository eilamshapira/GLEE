"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your previous proposal. Since I'm making the offer this round, I propose a division where I receive $600000 and you receive $400000. I believe this division is fair given the dynamics of our negotiation and the fact that both of us would benefit from reaching an agreement now rather than prolonging the process. I hope you agree and we can both move forward. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
