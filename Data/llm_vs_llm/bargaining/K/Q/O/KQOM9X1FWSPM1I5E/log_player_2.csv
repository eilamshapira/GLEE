Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your previous proposal. Since I'm making the offer this round, I propose a division where I receive $600,000 and you receive $400,000. I believe this division is fair given the dynamics of our negotiation and the fact that both of us would benefit from reaching an agreement now rather than prolonging the process. I hope you agree and we can both move forward.""}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I propose a perfectly equal 50-50 split. This is the fairest possible division, and it will help us conclude this negotiation in a way that's beneficial for both of us. There's no reason why either of us should get more than the other.
