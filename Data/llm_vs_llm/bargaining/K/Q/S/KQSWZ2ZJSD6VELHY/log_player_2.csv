"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me 40% of the total amount. While this isn't exactly an even split, I need to consider:

1. If I reject, the money will be worth 5% less next round due to inflation
2. I still have many rounds left, but the inflation penalty makes waiting costly
3. $4000 is still a significant amount

In round 2, even if I propose a better split, $10,000 would be worth $9,500 due to inflation. My $4000 now is better than a potential $5000 that's worth 5% less.
