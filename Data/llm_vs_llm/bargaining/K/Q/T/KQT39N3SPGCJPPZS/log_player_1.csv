"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, considering that inflation will affect my gains in future rounds if Bob rejects this offer.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I suggest we split the money equally, with each of us receiving $500,000. This is a fair and reasonable proposal that respects both parties' interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider that waiting another round will cost me another 10% in value. If I reject this offer and propose a better split next round, Bob might reject it, and my gains will be worth even less.

$300,000 with 10% inflation is better than risking further devaluation in future rounds, especially since Bob might continue to make unfavorable offers. While it's less than my initial proposal, it's still a significant amount, and the certainty of getting it now outweighs the risk of getting less value in future rounds.
