Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I still think 58/42 is a fairer split.  Let's get this done! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me. While her offer is getting closer to a more even split, I need to push for a better deal before the money loses too much value."
