"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance. However, I should consider the inflation rates.

If I reject and we go to the next round, my money will be worth 20% less, while Alice's will only be worth 10% less. This gives me a disadvantage in later rounds, as my share devalues faster than Alice's.

With a 50-50 split now, I would get $50. If I reject and propose something better next round, the total pot would effectively be worth less to me.

Given the asymmetric inflation rates, accepting a fair split now is likely better than trying to negotiate for more later.
