"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a reasonable but slightly advantageous offer for myself, considering I'm making the first move.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

This is a fair proposal where I get a slight advantage of $1,000 (55%) while still offering Bob a substantial amount (45%). Since there's no inflation effect on my end, I'm comfortable starting with this balanced offer that respects both parties' interests while maintaining a small strategic advantage for myself as the first mover."
