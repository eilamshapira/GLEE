"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60/40 seems reasonable""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a fair 50/50 split. This is more equitable than your previous offer, and since you don't face inflation penalties, it's still advantageous for you if we agree now. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is still worth the same, but Bob's offer is now worth 5% less to him, I can consider this a slightly better deal for me.

However, I still want to try to get a better split. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer is worth 5% less to him in each round, and I rejected his 50/50 split, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself while still being reasonable.

{""alice_gain"": 6500, 
""bob_gain"": 3500, 
""message"": ""Considering the inflation penalty, I'm being generous with 65/35. Let's settle before it's worth even less to you""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise at 55/45 in your favor. This is a fair middle ground that acknowledges your stronger position while still being reasonable. Let's avoid further rounds where we both lose value. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation penalty increasing for Bob, his offer is becoming more valuable to me relative to what he's giving up.

Considering the 55/45 split, I think it's a reasonable offer, and I don't want to risk losing value in future rounds.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
