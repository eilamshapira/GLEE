"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, 60/40 seems reasonable 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000
2. If I reject, we move to the next round where I can make an offer
3. However, due to 5% inflation per round, my money will be worth less if I wait
4. 60/40 split favors Alice significantly
5. Since this is the first round and I still have room to negotiate without losing too much value, I'll reject this offer

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a counter-offer:
1. A 50/50 split would be more fair than 60/40
2. I need to account for my 5% inflation penalty
3. I should be diplomatic but firm in my message

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50/50 split. This is more equitable than your previous offer, and since you don't face inflation penalties, it's still advantageous for you if we agree now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation penalty, I'm being generous with 65/35. Let's settle before it's worth even less to you 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $3,500, which due to 9.75% inflation is actually worth about $3,159 to me
2. This is worse than her first offer
3. She's trying to use the inflation pressure against me
4. However, we still have 9 rounds left, and the next round I can make an offer
5. At this point, the inflation isn't severe enough to force me to accept such an unfavorable split

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a strategic offer:
1. The inflation has reduced my negotiating power
2. A 55/45 split in Alice's favor might be more appealing to her while still being better for me than her last offer
3. I need to emphasize the mutual benefit of reaching an agreement soon

{""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise at 55/45 in your favor. This is a fair middle ground that acknowledges your stronger position while still being reasonable. Let's avoid further rounds where we both lose value.""}"
