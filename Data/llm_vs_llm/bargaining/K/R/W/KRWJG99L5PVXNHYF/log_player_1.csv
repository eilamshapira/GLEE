"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let me propose a fair split that accounts for the inflation risk for both parties.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is slightly in my favor but still quite fair, considering that if Bob rejects, we'll both lose value due to inflation. I'm offering a reasonable split that should be attractive enough to accept now rather than risk further devaluation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Due to inflation, if I accept:
   * My $40 is worth $36 (10% less)
   * Bob's $60 is worth $48 (20% less)
2. If I reject and make a new offer next round:
   * Further inflation will reduce values more
   * I might get a better split but at reduced value
3. Current offer gives me less than my initial proposal
4. But inflation is eating into potential future gains

Given that waiting another round would reduce the money's value further for both of us, and Bob's share is already being hit harder by inflation, I will reject and try one more time for a better split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since we're now in round 3, I need to consider that any money will be worth even less due to compounded inflation. I'll make a more balanced offer to try to end the game:

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}

I'm proposing a more moderate split than my first offer. Due to the higher inflation rate affecting Bob (20% per round vs my 10%), and the fact that we're already in round 3, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement now. This offer gives Bob a better deal than my first proposal while still maintaining a slight advantage for me, which is fair since I'm suffering less from inflation."
