"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me in this round, the effective amount is $100 * 0.8 = $80. For Alice, it's worth 10% less, so $100 * 0.9 = $90. 

To make a fair offer, I'll consider the original $100 and split it in a way that favors me slightly, given the decreasing value.

{""bob_gain"": 60, 
""alice_gain"": 40}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Alice's offer, the $48 I gain is worth 36% less than the original value, which means I get 48 * 0.64 = $30.72 in real value.

If I reject this offer, the next round will have even more inflation, reducing the value further.

Given this, accepting the offer seems like the better option.
