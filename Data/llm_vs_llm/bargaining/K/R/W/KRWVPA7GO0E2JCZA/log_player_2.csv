"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""My turn, a bit more balanced, don't you think?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob. Let's try a truly even split this time.  We're running out of time! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my $5000 is actually worth $5000 * 0.81 = $4050.
However, since Alice's gain is worth 36% less, her $5000 is actually worth $5000 * 0.64 = $3200 to her.
Given the situation, an even split might not be so even after all.
{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Due to inflation, the money I gain is worth 19% less than in the first round, and it will decrease by 10% each round. 
Considering this, I should try to get a larger share to compensate for the inflation.

""alice_gain"": 3500, 
""message"": ""Time is running out, and inflation is eating away at our money. Let's be realistic about who needs the larger share.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but I need to get a decent amount too. This is my final offer that leans slightly in my favor. Take it or we both get nothing. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my $4800 is actually worth $4800 * 0.6561 = $3148.88.
On the other hand, Alice's $5200 is worth $5200 * 0.4096 = $2127.52 to her.
Given the significant difference in value due to inflation, Alice's offer seems more favorable to me.
