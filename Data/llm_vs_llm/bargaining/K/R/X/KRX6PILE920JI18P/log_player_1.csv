"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a proposal for Round 1. Since both Bob and I face inflation penalties for delaying, I should consider a fair split that gives us both incentive to agree quickly.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose a 50-50 split. This is a fair division that respects both of our interests. With inflation affecting both of us in future rounds (10% for me and 5% for Bob), it's beneficial for us to reach an agreement now."
