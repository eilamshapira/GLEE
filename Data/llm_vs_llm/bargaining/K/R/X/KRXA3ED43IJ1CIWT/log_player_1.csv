"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I suggest a fair split where I get slightly more as the first mover, but you still get a substantial amount. Better to agree now than lose value to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the inflation, my offer reflects a fair split adjusted for the value loss since last round. Let's settle now to minimize further depreciation. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:
1. The total value has decreased by 5%
2. Bob's offer gives me $4750, which is less than my initial proposal
3. If I reject, we'll go to round 3 with another 5% loss
4. My $4750 now is worth more than what I might get after another round of inflation
