"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split, let's end this! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me 400,000$ (40%) and keeping 600,000$ (60%)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, my money will be worth less next round
4. 400,000$ now vs. potentially more but worth 5% less next round
5. With 12 rounds total, there's room to negotiate, but inflation will eat into gains
6. A 60-40 split on first offer seems somewhat unfair to me

I'll reject this offer since it's the first round and I believe I can get a better deal, even accounting for inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split, considering we're early in the game but also accounting for inflation risk:

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's do a fair 50-50 split and end this quickly before inflation affects us both.""}

This offer is strategic because:
1. It's a perfectly fair split that's hard to argue against
2. I remind Alice about inflation to encourage quick agreement
3. If she rejects, she'll make her next offer under 5% inflation pressure
4. 50-50 is a common focal point for negotiations
5. It improves my position from the previous 40-60 split while remaining reasonable"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle of my first offer, 58-42 is still generous! 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice is offering 420,000$ (42%), up from her initial 400,000$ (40%)
2. However, due to 9.75% inflation, 420,000$ is now worth about 379,050$
3. This is actually LESS than her first offer in real value
4. We still have 9 rounds left, but inflation is becoming significant
5. Each round reduces my purchasing power by 5%
6. Alice seems to be playing hardball, not accounting for my inflation penalty

Since this offer is actually worse for me than the first one in real terms, and we still have several rounds to negotiate:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I believe I can still get a better deal, even with inflation, as we're only in round 3 of 12."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a strategic offer considering the inflation pressure:

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Due to my 9.75% inflation penalty, I need a larger nominal amount just to maintain equal real value. This split is actually fair when accounting for inflation.""}

This offer is strategic because:
1. I'm explicitly explaining why I need more than 50% in nominal terms
2. With 9.75% inflation, 550,000$ is worth about 496,375$ to me in round 1 terms
3. This makes the real value split closer to 50-50 when accounting for my inflation penalty
4. I'm being transparent about my reasoning which might help Alice understand my position
5. If she rejects, her next offer will be under even more inflation pressure for me
6. We're a third through the rounds, so pressure to agree is mounting"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, 56-44 is my new bottom line. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice is offering 440,000$ (44%), but with 18.55% inflation, it's worth only 358,380$ to me in round 1 terms
2. This is still WORSE than her first offer (400,000$) in real value
3. She mentions inflation but isn't actually compensating for it
4. We're in round 5 of 12, so we're approaching the halfway point
5. Next round inflation will be around 23.55% for me
6. At this rate of declining value, I need to be very careful about further delays

Despite the declining value, this offer is still too low considering my inflation penalty. The real value keeps decreasing with each of her offers. I'll reject and make one more strong attempt:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given the mounting inflation pressure and the need to reach agreement, I'll make a carefully calculated offer:

{""bob_gain"": 580000,
""alice_gain"": 420000,
""message"": ""With my 18.55% inflation penalty, this 58-42 split gives me only 472,410$ in round 1 value while you get 420,000$ - making it nearly fair in real terms. We need to agree soon or inflation will hurt us both.""}

This offer is strategic because:
1. I've calculated that 580,000$ with 18.55% inflation gives me 472,410$ in real value
2. This makes the real value split much closer to 50-50 than it appears nominally
3. I'm showing the exact math to demonstrate fairness
4. I'm emphasizing the urgency as we're halfway through the rounds
5. Further delays will seriously erode value for both of us
6. The offer is significant enough to be worth accepting but not so high as to seem unreasonable given the circumstances"
