Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob that considers the 5% inflation penalty per round for me.

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split where I get slightly more to account for the 5% inflation penalty I face each round. If we go back and forth for several rounds, I'll lose value rapidly. This is a good deal for both of us - you get nearly half, and we can both walk away happy without further delays.""}"
