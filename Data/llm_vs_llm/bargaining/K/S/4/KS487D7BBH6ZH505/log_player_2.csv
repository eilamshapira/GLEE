"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split where I get slightly more to account for the 5% inflation penalty I face each round. If we go back and forth for several rounds, I'll lose value rapidly. This is a good deal for both of us - you get nearly half, and we can both walk away happy without further delays. 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
