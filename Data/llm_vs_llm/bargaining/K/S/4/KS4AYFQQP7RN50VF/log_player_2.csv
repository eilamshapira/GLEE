"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which would give each of us $500,000. This is generally considered a fair division.

However, I need to keep in mind that if I reject this offer, I'll make the next proposal, but the total money will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation. So if I reject, we'd effectively be dividing $950,000 from my perspective.

Given that this is a fair first offer and inflation will reduce the value for me in subsequent rounds, I'll accept.
