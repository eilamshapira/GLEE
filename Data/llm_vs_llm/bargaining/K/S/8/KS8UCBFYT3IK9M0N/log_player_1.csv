"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I will propose a division of the $10,000, keeping in mind the potential for inflation to affect me in future rounds.

Here's my offer in JSON format:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round and Bob's share is now worth 10% less to him, his offer of $4500 for me and $5500 for him seems somewhat reasonable, although less favorable than my initial proposal. I will accept this offer to avoid further potential losses due to future rounds.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
