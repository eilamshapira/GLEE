"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer to divide the $10,000 considering our different inflation rates.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I suggest we split the money in a way that's fair considering the different inflation rates we face. Since my inflation rate is higher (20% vs your 10%), I'm proposing I get a slightly larger portion now rather than waiting for future rounds when the money will be worth less to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5700, ""bob_gain"": 4300}

Let me explain my reasoning: Because of our different inflation rates, waiting is more costly for me than for Bob. After 2 rounds, my money has already lost 36% of its value while Bob's has only lost 19%. Given this asymmetry, I'm proposing a split that accounts for this disadvantage I face with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5300 
# Bob gain: 4700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
