"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's split it 60/40. This is a fair offer considering we only have 100$.

# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, since the value of money decreases for me each round, I propose a 55/45 split in my favor this time. Let's settle before it devalues further.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the value is decreasing, but I also need a fair share. How about we meet in the middle at 52/48? This gives you a slight edge considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
