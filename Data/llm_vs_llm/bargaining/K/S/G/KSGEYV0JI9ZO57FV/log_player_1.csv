Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, taking into account the potential for inflation. Let's get this done before we lose any more money. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
```

This offer is worse for me than Bob's previous rejected offer. It's likely he's trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm willing to gamble that he's also feeling the pressure."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, this is a compromise.  We're both losing money by dragging this out. Let's settle this now."" 
}
```

Reasoning:

* **Compromise:** I've moved closer to a 50/50 split, demonstrating willingness to negotiate. 
* **Urgency:** Highlighting the time pressure emphasizes the cost of further delays for both of us.
* **Clarity:**  A clear, simple offer is more likely to be accepted."
