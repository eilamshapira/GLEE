"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","To start the game, I'll make a reasonable offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, I want to make a deal quickly. However, I also want to be fair to encourage Bob to accept my offer.

Here's my offer for Round 1:
```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```
This is a 50/50 split, which seems like a good starting point for negotiations. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, the actual value I'd get from Bob's offer is:
400000 * 0.8 = 320000

Considering this, Bob's offer doesn't seem very appealing to me, as I'd be getting less than half of the original amount in value.

My response:
```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer was rejected, it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 20% * 2 = 40% less than the original amount (20% less in Round 1 and another 20% less in Round 2, cumulative effect: 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64).

To make a deal, I'll aim for a split that takes into account the decreasing value for me. I'll offer a bit more to Bob to incentivize him to accept.

Here's my offer for Round 3:
```json
{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000}
```
This offer gives me a larger share than Bob's previous offer, but still considers the decreasing value due to inflation. Let's see how Bob responds!"
