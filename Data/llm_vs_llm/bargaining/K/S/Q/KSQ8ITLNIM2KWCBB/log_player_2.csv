"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering a 50-50 split, which might seem fair at first glance. However, I have a significant advantage here because Alice faces a 20% depreciation per round while I don't face any depreciation.

If I reject this offer, in the next round I can propose a split that takes advantage of this depreciation. For Alice, the $500,000 will only be worth $400,000 in the next round, which means she might be willing to accept a less equal split in my favor.

Therefore, I should reject this offer and propose a more favorable split in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice faces a 20% depreciation per round and I don't, I can propose a split that's more favorable to me while still being attractive to Alice. In this round, $1 for Alice is worth only $0.80 of round 1 value.

I'll propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which for Alice is still better than waiting another round where her share would depreciate further.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split where I get $600,000 and Alice gets $400,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 580000 
# Alice gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is offering me $580,000, which is better than my previous proposal where I would have gotten $600,000
2. Even though this is slightly less than what I proposed, accepting now guarantees the money
3. If I reject, we move to round 4, where:
   - Alice's money will depreciate further (by 48%)
   - We lose more negotiation rounds
   - There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal
4. This is a reasonable improvement from the initial 50-50 split
5. The risk of continuing negotiation might outweigh the potential benefits

Given these factors, I'll accept this offer. It's a good compromise that gives me a significant majority while still being fair enough to Alice.
