This is a tough decision point. Alice is clearly trying to push me to a point where I'll accept a bad deal due to inflation. However, accepting this offer would mean a significant loss compared to what I could have gotten in earlier rounds. I'm hoping she'll become more reasonable, but I need to be prepared to make a difficult choice soon if the trend continues."

Round 6

I'm shifting my strategy.  The continuous devaluation makes it increasingly risky to hold out for a highly favorable deal. A 50/50 split, while not ideal, guarantees a reasonable outcome considering the circumstances."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.

I need to cut my losses. The inflation is eating away at the potential gains, and this offer is better than what I can expect if I continue to reject and the trend continues."
