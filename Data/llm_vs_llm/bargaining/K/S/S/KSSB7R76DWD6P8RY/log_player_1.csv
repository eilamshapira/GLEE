"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll propose a division that considers our respective inflation rates and aims for a fair split.

{""alice_gain"": 5400,
""bob_gain"": 4600,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing I get $5400 and you get $4600. This accounts for our different inflation rates - my money loses value faster (10% vs your 5% per round). This way we both get close to equal real value and can avoid losing money to inflation by settling now.""}"
