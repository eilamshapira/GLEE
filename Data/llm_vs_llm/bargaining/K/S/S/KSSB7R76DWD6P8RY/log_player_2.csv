"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing I get $5400 and you get $4600. This accounts for our different inflation rates - my money loses value faster (10% vs your 5% per round). This way we both get close to equal real value and can avoid losing money to inflation by settling now. 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
