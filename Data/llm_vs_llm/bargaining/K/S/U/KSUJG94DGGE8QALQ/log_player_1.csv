"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to propose a split of the $1,000,000, keeping in mind the inflation that affects me each round. Since this is the first round, I should aim for a more advantageous split, but also make it reasonable enough for Bob to accept.

Here's my proposal:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   **My reasoning:** I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This is based on the idea that being the first proposer gives me some leverage. I am also aware that I will be penalized with inflation of 20% if this round does not conclude the negotiation.
*   **Why Bob might accept:** $400,000 is still a significant amount of money. Bob might accept this offer rather than risk going to later rounds where either the offer might be worse, or he anticipates the offer will be less acceptable because of my inflation concerns."
