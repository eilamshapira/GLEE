"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a counter-offer in the next round that's more equitable. 6000-4000 split is too imbalanced given we're both equal participants in this negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I propose an equal split of the money, which is the fairest solution for both parties."
