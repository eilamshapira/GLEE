"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Since Alice's money loses 10% value each round, while mine doesn't lose value:

* Current offer: I get $5000, Alice gets $5000
* If we go to next round:
  * I can propose a different split
  * Alice's portion would be worth 10% less to her
  * This gives me negotiating leverage

I can likely get a better deal by rejecting this and making my own proposal next round, since Alice will be more motivated to accept due to the 10% loss she faces.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice faces a 10% depreciation each round, I'll propose a split that's somewhat in my favor but still reasonable enough that she should accept to avoid further depreciation.

If she rejects, her money will be worth another 10% less in the next round, so she has incentive to accept a moderately uneven split now.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

I propose this 60-40 split because:
1. It's better than an even split for me
2. For Alice, $4000 now is better than risking further depreciation
3. It's not so extreme that it would feel unfair and trigger an emotional rejection"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Current offer: I get $5500, Alice gets $4500 (which is worth only $3645 to her due to 19% depreciation)
2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make another offer
   * Alice's money will depreciate by another 10%
   * But there's a risk of back-and-forth that could hurt both of us

This offer is actually pretty good for me:
* I get more than half ($5500)
* Alice has already conceded from her initial 50-50 split
* The longer we negotiate, the more total value is lost due to Alice's depreciation

I think this is a reasonable deal, and continuing to negotiate might lead to a less optimal outcome for both parties.
