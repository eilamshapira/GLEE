"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly! I propose 550k for me and 450k for you. This is a generous offer to avoid inflation eating into our gains. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $450,000 while taking $550,000
2. If I reject, the next round will have 10% inflation, meaning the total value for me will be worth only $900,000
3. If I make a counter-offer, Alice might reject it, leading to further rounds and more value loss
4. $450,000 now is better than potentially getting less in future rounds due to inflation
5. While not a perfect 50-50 split, it's a reasonable offer given the inflation risk
