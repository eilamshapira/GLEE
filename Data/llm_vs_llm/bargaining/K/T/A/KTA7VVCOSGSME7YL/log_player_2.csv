"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer strategically. She's proposing I get $400,000 while she gets $600,000. While this isn't a 50-50 split, it's still a substantial amount of money. However, since this is just the first round and I have more opportunities to negotiate, I believe I can get a better deal.

By rejecting this offer, I'll get to make the next proposal, which gives me more control. The 60-40 split in Alice's favor isn't compelling enough for me to accept right away.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while keeping the tone professional and cooperative.
