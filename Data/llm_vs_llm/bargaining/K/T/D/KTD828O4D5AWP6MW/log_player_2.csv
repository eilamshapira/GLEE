"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically. 

Alice is offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000 total (40%). While this isn't exactly an even split, it's still a substantial amount of money. 

Key considerations:
1. This is just the first round, so I have room to negotiate
2. There's no inflation penalty for me, but I don't know Alice's inflation situation
3. We have a maximum of 12 rounds before we both get nothing
4. I can make a counter-offer next round if I reject

Given that I'm in a strong position early in the game and could potentially negotiate a better deal, I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer, but still slightly in my favor since I have the negotiating power now.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I propose taking $550,000 (55%) while giving Alice $450,000 (45%). This is more equitable than Alice's first offer, and since I know I don't face inflation penalties, I can afford to be reasonable while still seeking an advantage. This offer is close enough to a 50-50 split that it might be appealing to Alice, especially if she faces any inflation penalties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice's $550,000 portion is now worth only 64% of its original value due to 36% inflation on her side
2. My $450,000 would still be worth the full amount since I don't face inflation
3. Alice has increased her offer to me from the original $400,000 to $450,000
4. Her effective gain would be around $352,000 (550000 Ã— 0.64)
5. This means I would actually be getting a better real value than Alice

Given that:
- The offer to me has improved
- I would actually get more real value than Alice due to her inflation
- We still have 9 rounds left where inflation could get worse for Alice
- There's risk in continuing to negotiate

I will accept this offer.
