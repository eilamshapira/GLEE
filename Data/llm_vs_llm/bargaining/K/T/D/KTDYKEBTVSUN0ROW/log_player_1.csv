"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering future inflation will affect us both.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation rates, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This accounts for the higher impact of inflation on my side and still offers you a significant share. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $45 at 95% value = $42.75 real value
- If I reject and propose next round:
  - Money will be worth even less (90% for me)
  - Bob would be even more pressured by inflation (80% for him)
  - But there's risk of further negotiation rounds

Given that Bob's offer is reasonably fair considering the inflation rates, and the risk of losing more value in future rounds, I should accept.
