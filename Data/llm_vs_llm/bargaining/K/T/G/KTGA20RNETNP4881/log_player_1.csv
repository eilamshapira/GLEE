"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, consider that if we continue to another round, the money loses 10% value for you. My offer gives you $45 now, which is better than receiving even $50 in the next round (which would only be worth $45 to you due to 10% inflation). This is a fair split that acknowledges the time pressure you face. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
