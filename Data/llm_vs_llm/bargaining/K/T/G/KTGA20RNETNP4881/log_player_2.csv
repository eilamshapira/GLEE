"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing that I get $40 while she gets $60, claiming this is ""fair"" with her taking ""a bit more.""

Important factors to consider:
- The money doesn't decrease in value for me between rounds (0% inflation)
- For Alice, the money loses 10% value each round
- If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
- Alice will face diminishing returns if we continue to later rounds

Since there's no penalty for me to continue to the next round and I can make my own proposal, while Alice faces a 10% loss in value, I should reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that leverages the inflation factor while still being reasonable enough for Alice to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Alice, consider that if we continue to another round, the money loses 10% value for you. My offer gives you $45 now, which is better than receiving even $50 in the next round (which would only be worth $45 to you due to 10% inflation). This is a fair split that acknowledges the time pressure you face.""}"
