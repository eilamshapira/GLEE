"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the new information. Bob's offer is $50 for me and $50 for him. However, his $50 is worth 20% less than the original $50. So, effectively, I'm getting $50 and he's getting the equivalent of $40 in round 1 dollars (50 * 0.8 = 40).

Since my money has not been affected by inflation, and I am getting $50 in this round, I will accept the offer.

```json

  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
