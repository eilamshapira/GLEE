"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing a 50-50 split, giving us each $500,000. This seems fair at first glance, but I need to factor in the inflation penalty. If I reject this offer, the total amount will effectively be worth 10% less to me in the next round, meaning we'd be dividing what feels like $900,000 to me.

If I make a counter-offer in the next round, I'd need to ask for more than $500,000 just to match the current offer's value. And there's no guarantee Alice would accept.

Given that this is a fair initial offer and the inflation penalty makes waiting risky, I'll accept.
