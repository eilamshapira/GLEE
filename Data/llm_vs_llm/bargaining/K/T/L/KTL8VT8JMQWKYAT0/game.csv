45.0,55.0,"Alice, considering the inflation rates, I propose 55 for me and 45 for you. This way, we both get a reasonable share before the value drops further.",Bob,2,

50.0,50.0,"Alice, since we're both losing value rapidly, let's go for an equal split this round. 50 for you and 50 for me. This way, we can end the game fairly and minimize our losses to inflation.",Bob,4,
