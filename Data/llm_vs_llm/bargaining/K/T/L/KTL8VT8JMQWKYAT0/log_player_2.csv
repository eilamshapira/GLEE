Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's start with a fair split. I get 60, you get 40. This gives us both a good starting point before inflation eats away at the value!

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concern about inflation. I'll meet you halfway. How about I get 55, and you get 45? It's a better deal than your offer and we both lose less to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
