"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, considering I'm making the first move and taking the initiative in our negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer gives me $400,000
2. If I reject, next round I can make an offer, but:
   - The money will be worth 20% less to me
   - Maximum I could get in next round would be effectively worth $800,000 * 0.8 = $640,000 (if Alice accepts)
   - But Alice might reject, leading to further rounds and more inflation

A 60-40 split isn't terribly unfair for a first offer. While I could try to negotiate for better terms, the risk of inflation eating into my gains is significant. Each round reduces my purchasing power by 20%, which is a strong incentive to reach an agreement quickly.
