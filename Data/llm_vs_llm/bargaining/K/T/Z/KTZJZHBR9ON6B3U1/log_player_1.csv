"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a fair 60-40 split in my favor since I'm affected by inflation while you're not. This way we both get a good value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's split it 50-50. This way, we both get an equal share and can proceed without any loss from inflation on your side. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Rationale (not part of response): With 20% inflation, a $50 share would only be worth $40 to me now. I should try to negotiate for a better split to compensate for my inflation penalty."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Bob, due to 20% inflation affecting my share, I need a larger portion to maintain fair value. A 65-35 split would give me about $52 in real value while you get $35. This is more equitable considering the inflation impact.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the impact of inflation on you. Let's do a 55-45 split in your favor. This will slightly improve your real value while still being fair. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Rationale (not part of response): With 48.8% inflation, my $55 would be worth about $28.16 in real value. If I reject, the next round would have even worse inflation (59.04%), making it harder to get a good deal. Better to accept now than risk further value loss."
