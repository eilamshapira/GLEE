Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, due to 20% inflation affecting my share, I need a larger portion to maintain fair value. A 65-35 split would give me about $52 in real value while you get $35. This is more equitable considering the inflation impact.

# Alice gain: 65
