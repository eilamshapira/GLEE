55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we split the $100 fairly—55 for me and 45 for you. Settling now avoids any delays or inflation concerns. What do you think?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"Hi Alice, considering the potential impact of inflation, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor this round. Let's settle now to avoid further value loss. What do you say?",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your proposal. However, given that I'm receiving $40 with no inflation while I could potentially secure a better deal by making my own proposal in the next round, I must decline your offer.",Alice,2,reject
43.0,57.0,"Hi Bob, to avoid further devaluation for you in a future round, I propose a division of $100 where I receive $43 and you receive $57. With the current inflation adjustment (your money being worth 10% less this round), you'll effectively get about $51.3—slightly better than what you'd likely secure if we delayed further. Let's settle now and avoid additional losses!",Alice,3,
