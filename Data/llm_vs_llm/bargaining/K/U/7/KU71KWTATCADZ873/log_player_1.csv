"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split the $100 fairly—55 for me and 45 for you. Settling now avoids any delays or inflation concerns. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the potential impact of inflation, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor this round. Let's settle now to avoid further value loss. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your proposal. However, given that I'm receiving $40 with no inflation while I could potentially secure a better deal by making my own proposal in the next round, I must decline your offer.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 43, ""bob_gain"": 57, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, to avoid further devaluation for you in a future round, I propose a division of $100 where I receive $43 and you receive $57. With the current inflation adjustment (your money being worth 10% less this round), you'll effectively get about $51.3—slightly better than what you'd likely secure if we delayed further. Let's settle now and avoid additional losses!""}"
