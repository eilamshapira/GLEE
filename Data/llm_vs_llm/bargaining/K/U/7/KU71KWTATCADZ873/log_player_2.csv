"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the $100 fairly—55 for me and 45 for you. Settling now avoids any delays or inflation concerns. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering the potential impact of inflation, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor this round. Let's settle now to avoid further value loss. What do you say?""
}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to avoid further devaluation for you in a future round, I propose a division of $100 where I receive $43 and you receive $57. With the current inflation adjustment (your money being worth 10% less this round), you'll effectively get about $51.3—slightly better than what you'd likely secure if we delayed further. Let's settle now and avoid additional losses! 
# Bob gain: 57 
# Alice gain: 43 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
