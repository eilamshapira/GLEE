"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering a 50-50 split of the $10,000, which would give me $5,000.

If I reject this offer, I'll get to make a counter-proposal in the next round, but due to inflation, the total value will be worth 10% less to me. So instead of dividing $10,000, from my perspective we'd be dividing $9,000 in the next round.

Even if I propose a more favorable split in the next round, Alice might reject it, leading to further rounds and more inflation for me.
