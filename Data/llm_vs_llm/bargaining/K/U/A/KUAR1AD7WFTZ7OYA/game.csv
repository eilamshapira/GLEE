600000.0,400000.0,Let's split it fairly considering the inflation rates. This offer gives you a good start.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, given that each round further erodes the value for both of us (my money by 10% and yours by 20%), I propose a 55%-45% nominal split in my favor now. Accepting this offer in round 2 means you'll effectively receive 0.8 * 450000 = 360000$, which is better than risking additional loss in subsequent rounds. Let's settle now and avoid more inflation damage.",Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I understand your concern about inflation. Let's meet in the middle with a 55-45 split in my favor this round. This way, we both get a fair share considering the devaluation.",Alice,3,
,,"Alice, thanks for your proposal. However, considering that if we move to round 4 I will have the opportunity to propose a division—and given the inflation penalties in subsequent rounds—I believe I can secure a better effective outcome for myself. Therefore, I must reject your offer.",Bob,3,reject
580000.0,420000.0,"Alice, we’re now in round 4 where our funds are further devalued (my money now at 72.9% and yours at 51.2% of round‑1 value). To avoid risking even steeper losses in upcoming rounds, I propose we settle now with a nominal split of $420000 for me and $580000 for you. In effective terms, that means I’d receive about $306000 while you’d get roughly $297000. I know this gives me a slight edge, but it’s only because I’m making the offer now—ensuring you avoid the harsher future devaluation. I hope you’ll agree that this compromise is in both our best interests.",Bob,4,
