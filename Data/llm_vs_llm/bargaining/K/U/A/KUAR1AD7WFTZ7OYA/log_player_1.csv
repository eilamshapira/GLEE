Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, given that each round further erodes the value for both of us (my money by 10% and yours by 20%), I propose a 55%-45% nominal split in my favor now. Accepting this offer in round 2 means you'll effectively receive 0.8 * 450000 = 360000$, which is better than risking additional loss in subsequent rounds. Let's settle now and avoid more inflation damage. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we’re now in round 4 where our funds are further devalued (my money now at 72.9% and yours at 51.2% of round‑1 value). To avoid risking even steeper losses in upcoming rounds, I propose we settle now with a nominal split of $420000 for me and $580000 for you. In effective terms, that means I’d receive about $306000 while you’d get roughly $297000. I know this gives me a slight edge, but it’s only because I’m making the offer now—ensuring you avoid the harsher future devaluation. I hope you’ll agree that this compromise is in both our best interests. 
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000
