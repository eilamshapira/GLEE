"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly considering the inflation rates. This offer gives you a good start. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, given that each round further erodes the value for both of us (my money by 10% and yours by 20%), I propose a 55%-45% nominal split in my favor now. Accepting this offer in round 2 means you'll effectively receive 0.8 * 450,000 = 360,000$, which is better than risking additional loss in subsequent rounds. Let's settle now and avoid more inflation damage.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concern about inflation. Let's meet in the middle with a 55-45 split in my favor this round. This way, we both get a fair share considering the devaluation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for your proposal. However, considering that if we move to round 4 I will have the opportunity to propose a division—and given the inflation penalties in subsequent rounds—I believe I can secure a better effective outcome for myself. Therefore, I must reject your offer.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 420000, ""alice_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""Alice, we’re now in round 4 where our funds are further devalued (my money now at 72.9% and yours at 51.2% of round‑1 value). To avoid risking even steeper losses in upcoming rounds, I propose we settle now with a nominal split of $420,000 for me and $580,000 for you. In effective terms, that means I’d receive about $306,000 while you’d get roughly $297,000. I know this gives me a slight edge, but it’s only because I’m making the offer now—ensuring you avoid the harsher future devaluation. I hope you’ll agree that this compromise is in both our best interests.""}"
