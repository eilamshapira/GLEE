Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer Alice, but how about a slightly better split for me this time? We can still both walk away with a good amount.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a bit more, but let's meet in the middle. This way, we both get a fair share considering the inflation affecting your side. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

I need to push for a better deal still. While Alice is being somewhat considerate of the inflation, I stand to lose a significant chunk of the potential value."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6200, ""alice_gain"": 3800, ""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking and the value is slipping away with each round.  This offer ensures we both benefit, but time is of the essence for me.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see the urgency due to inflation on your side. Let's settle on this offer; it's a bit more in your favor but still fair for both of us given the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 5800 
# Alice gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This offer is finally reasonably close to my desired outcome, especially considering the time pressure and the impact of inflation.  It's not perfect, but it's better to secure a decent amount now than risk getting even less later."
