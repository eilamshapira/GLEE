"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

1. The offer is $450,000 for me and $550,000 for Alice
2. If I reject, we move to next round where:
   * My money will be worth 5% less
   * Alice's money will be worth 10% less
   * I get to make the next offer

Given that Alice's money devalues faster than mine (10% vs 5%), I might get a better deal by rejecting and making a counter-offer. My $450,000 would be worth $427,500 next round, but Alice's $550,000 would be worth only $495,000.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better split, taking advantage of the asymmetric inflation pressure on Alice.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice's money devalues faster than mine (10% vs 5% per round), and she knows this, I should propose a split that's favorable to me but still attractive enough for her to accept rather than risk further devaluation.

For Alice, waiting another round would mean her share would be worth 10% less, so I can use this as leverage.

I'll propose a slightly better split for myself while still being fair enough that she should accept:

{""bob_gain"": 525000, 
""alice_gain"": 475000}

This gives me a majority share while still leaving Alice with a substantial amount that's worth more to her now than a potentially larger share would be after another round of 10% devaluation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $480,000, which due to 9.75% inflation is actually worth $433,200
2. If I reject and we go to next round:
   * My money will devalue another 5% (total 14.75%)
   * Alice's money will devalue another 10% (total 29%)
   * I get to make the next offer

Alice has increased her offer from the first round ($450,000 â†’ $480,000), showing she's willing to negotiate. However, due to inflation, I'm actually getting less value than her initial offer.

Given the accelerating devaluation and the risk of running out of rounds (we've used 3 of 12), I think it's wise to accept this offer. Further negotiation might lead to both of us losing more value to inflation.
