"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think through this:

1. The current offer gives me $400,000 and Alice $600,000
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Alice in the next round
3. I'll be able to make the next offer if I reject
4. Given the steep inflation rate for Alice (20%), she's under more pressure to reach a deal quickly
5. I could potentially get a better deal in the next round since I'll be making the offer and Alice will be facing a bigger depreciation

Given these factors, I believe I can get a better deal by rejecting this offer and making my own proposal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that:
1. Alice is facing a 20% depreciation per round vs my 5%
2. Alice rejected a 60/40 split in her favor
3. She needs to act faster than me due to higher depreciation
4. But I still need her to accept to get anything

I'll propose a more balanced split, but still slightly in my favor:

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

This gives me a slight advantage while still being reasonable enough that Alice might accept, considering her higher depreciation rate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept now:
   * I get $450,000 × (1 - 0.0975) = $406,125 in round 1 value
   * Alice gets $550,000 × (1 - 0.36) = $352,000 in round 1 value

2. If I reject:
   * Next round money will be worth even less (5% more for me, 20% more for Alice)
   * I get to make the next offer
   * But we're using up rounds (9 left)

3. Key considerations:
   * Alice has increased her offer to me from the initial $400,000
   * The offer gives me more actual value than Alice due to the inflation differences
   * Further delays will reduce the real value for both of us
   * This is a reasonable offer given the depreciation

Given that I'm actually getting more real value than Alice due to the inflation differences, and that further delays will only reduce the total pie, I should accept this offer.
