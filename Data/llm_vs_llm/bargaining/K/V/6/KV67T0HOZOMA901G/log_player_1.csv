"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair - I'll take 60% since I made the first move, and you get a solid 40%. Better to agree now than lose value to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60% is too much for just making the first move. How about we meet closer to the middle? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The deal is reasonable given the 5% inflation penalty we'd face in the next round. While I initially asked for more, a 45-55 split is fair enough and securing the deal now is better than risking further value loss."
