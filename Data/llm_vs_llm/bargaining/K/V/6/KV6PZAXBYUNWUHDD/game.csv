600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get your money immediately without risking inflation effects.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Alice, considering the inflation risk for me, I think a 55-45 split in my favor is more reasonable. This way, we both get a fair share while accounting for the economic conditions affecting me.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, since inflation is affecting me more severely (20% per round vs your 10%), I need a larger share to compensate. This 65-35 split is fair considering the differential inflation impact. If we keep rejecting offers, we both lose more value. Let's make a deal now.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, given the increasing impact of inflation on both of us, I believe a 60-40 split in my favor is now more appropriate. We need to consider the decreasing value of the money and find a middle ground to avoid losing more value.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
700000.0,300000.0,"Bob, let's be realistic about our situation. After 5 rounds, inflation has reduced my value by nearly 50%, while yours only by 27%. I need a larger share to compensate for this severe disadvantage. This 70-30 split will give us roughly equal effective value after inflation. Let's end this now before we both lose more.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"Alice, I understand that inflation is affecting you more, but I need to secure more value for myself as well. Let's settle for a 65-35 split in my favor. This way, we both get a fair share considering the decreasing value of money.",Bob,6,
