Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation risk for me, I think a 55-45 split in my favor is more reasonable. This way, we both get a fair share while accounting for the economic conditions affecting me. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The inflation is affecting me more severely (20% vs 10%), so I should try to secure a better deal in the next round, even accounting for the continued inflation impact."

""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Bob, since inflation is affecting me more severely (20% per round vs your 10%), I need a larger share to compensate. This 65-35 split is fair considering the differential inflation impact. If we keep rejecting offers, we both lose more value. Let's make a deal now.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, given the increasing impact of inflation on both of us, I believe a 60-40 split in my favor is now more appropriate. We need to consider the decreasing value of the money and find a middle ground to avoid losing more value. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The inflation impact on me is much higher (48.8% vs 27.1%), and Bob's offer gives him an even larger share than before. I'll try one more time to reach a more equitable agreement, considering the disproportionate inflation effects."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 700000,
""bob_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic about our situation. After 5 rounds, inflation has reduced my value by nearly 50%, while yours only by 27%. I need a larger share to compensate for this severe disadvantage. This 70-30 split will give us roughly equal effective value after inflation. Let's end this now before we both lose more.""

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that inflation is affecting you more, but I need to secure more value for myself as well. Let's settle for a 65-35 split in my favor. This way, we both get a fair share considering the decreasing value of money. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The inflation impact is becoming severe (67.23% for me), and with 6 more rounds potentially ahead, continuing to negotiate would dramatically reduce the real value for both of us. While this isn't an ideal split, my actual value after inflation (350000 * 0.3277 = 114,695) is better than risking further rounds where inflation could make any larger nominal amount worth even less."
