"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get your money immediately without risking inflation effects. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering the inflation risk for me, I think a 55-45 split in my favor is more reasonable. This way, we both get a fair share while accounting for the economic conditions affecting me.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, since inflation is affecting me more severely (20% per round vs your 10%), I need a larger share to compensate. This 65-35 split is fair considering the differential inflation impact. If we keep rejecting offers, we both lose more value. Let's make a deal now. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Alice, given the increasing impact of inflation on both of us, I believe a 60-40 split in my favor is now more appropriate.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic about our situation. After 5 rounds, inflation has reduced my value by nearly 50%, while yours only by 27%. I need a larger share to compensate for this severe disadvantage. This 70-30 split will give us roughly equal effective value after inflation. Let's end this now before we both lose more. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000
