"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'd like to make a fair offer to Bob that considers the inflation rates for both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

Bob, I'm proposing a split where I get $55 and you get $45. This is slightly favorable to me but reasonable considering inflation affects you more than me (20% vs 10% per round). If we delay, we both lose value, so it makes sense to reach an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a more balanced offer considering our different inflation rates.

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}

Bob, I'm proposing a more balanced split where I get $52 and you get $48. Since inflation is affecting you more quickly (20% vs my 10% per round), we should try to reach an agreement soon. This offer gives you a fair share while recognizing that I'm also losing value with each round. Let's settle this now so we can both maximize our gains."
