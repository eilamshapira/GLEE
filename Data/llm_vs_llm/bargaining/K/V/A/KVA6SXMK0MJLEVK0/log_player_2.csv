"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the effective amount I'm dividing is $100 * 0.8 = $80. However, to make the offer, I'll still use the original $100 and consider the reduced value in my decision.

My offer is:
{""bob_gain"": 60, 
""alice_gain"": 40}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the effective amount I'm considering is reduced. Since the money is worth 36% less for me, the value of the offer is:
$48 * (1 - 0.36) = $48 * 0.64 = $30.72 (in terms of the original value)

For Alice, the money is worth 19% less, but that's her consideration, not mine.

Given this, I'll decide whether to accept or reject the offer.
