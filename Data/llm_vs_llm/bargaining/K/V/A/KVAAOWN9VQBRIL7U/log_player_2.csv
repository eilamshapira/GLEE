"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split it 55/45. Due to the inflation factor for me, I'm prioritizing a quick resolution. I believe this is fair considering the stakes. Looking forward to your thoughts! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider my options carefully here. With a 20% inflation rate per round for me, it's important to reach an agreement relatively quickly. If I reject this offer, I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, but the total value will be worth less to me.

Alice is offering me 45% of the money ($450,000). If I reject and wait until the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me, so I'd need to secure more than 56.25% of the pot in the next round just to break even compared to this offer.

Given the significant inflation penalty I face and the fact that this is a reasonable first offer, I'll accept.
