"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's agree on a fair split right away. I'm offering a slightly better deal for me, but a guaranteed $450000 for you. Consider the risk of future rounds and potential inflation! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the game and my role as Bob. I need to consider the risk of inflation eroding the value of my share in future rounds.

Here's my thought process:

*   **Current Offer:** I get $450,000.

*   **Inflation:** Each round the money is worth 20% less for me. This effect is cumulative.

*   **Worst Case Scenario:** If I reject this and Alice is unreasonable in later rounds or we reach the 12 round limit, I might end up with nothing.

*   **Analysis:** Receiving $450,000 now is a substantial amount. Even considering the 20% inflation each round, the potential gains from negotiating a better deal later might not be worth the risk.

Therefore, I will accept this offer.
