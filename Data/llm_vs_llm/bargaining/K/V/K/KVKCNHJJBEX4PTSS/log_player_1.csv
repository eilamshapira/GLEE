"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about the 10% penalty per round. Let's be fair - I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This actually gives you more value than if we extend the game further, as your share would continue to decrease in value for you. This is a win-win solution that optimizes our total outcome. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000

Round 3

""bob_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. If I get $6500, it's actually worth $5850 to me now due to the 10% penalty from two rounds. If we keep going, we both lose value. This is a reasonable offer that acknowledges both our positions.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be practical about this. With each round, your share loses more value - your $3500 is still worth $2555 to you after the inflation penalty. If we continue to round 5, you'll lose even more value. This offer maximizes what you can still get in real terms. Remember, any further delay will only decrease your actual takeaway. This is a reasonable solution that acknowledges our position in the game. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500
