"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make this fair and efficient - I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, considering I face a 10% penalty per round. This way we both walk away with a good deal without delays. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate this offer carefully considering the game conditions.

Alice is proposing that she gets $6,000 and I get $4,000.

If I reject, we'll go to another round where I can make a counter-offer. The key point is that with each round, the money loses 10% of its value for Alice, but maintains full value for me.

Since there's no penalty for me to extend the game, and Alice faces a 10% reduction each round, I have negotiating leverage. If we go to another round, Alice would only get 90% of whatever we agree to then.

Given these conditions, I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a strategic counter-offer that acknowledges the inflation penalty Alice faces.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, 
""alice_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concern about the 10% penalty per round. Let's be fair - I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This actually gives you more value than if we extend the game further, as your share would continue to decrease in value for you. This is a win-win solution that optimizes our total outcome.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. If I get $6500, it's actually worth $5850 to me now due to the 10% penalty from two rounds. If we keep going, we both lose value. This is a reasonable offer that acknowledges both our positions. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's new offer considering the inflation penalty she faces.

Alice is now offering me $3,500 and taking $6,500 for herself. Due to inflation for her, the $6,500 is only worth $5,265 to her (19% less than the original value).

If I reject, we'll go to round 4 where I can make another offer. At that point, Alice will face even more inflation (approximately 27% total), further reducing the value of her share.

Given the game structure, I still have the advantage since I don't face any inflation penalty. I can make a more favorable counter-offer in the next round that still gives Alice incentive to accept rather than continuing to lose value.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6500, 
""alice_gain"": 3500, 
""message"": ""Alice, let's be practical about this. With each round, your share loses more value - your $3,500 is still worth $2,555 to you after the inflation penalty. If we continue to round 5, you'll lose even more value. This offer maximizes what you can still get in real terms. Remember, any further delay will only decrease your actual takeaway. This is a reasonable solution that acknowledges our position in the game.""}"
