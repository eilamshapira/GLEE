"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because if you reject, the money will be worth less to me next round due to inflation, while it maintains full value for you.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation that affects you, I think a 55-45 split in my favor is reasonable. If you reject, the money will be worth even less to you next round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. I would get $4500, but due to 20% inflation, it's actually worth $3600 to me
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount I get will be worth another 20% less
3. Bob's argument about inflation affecting future rounds is valid
4. While I'd prefer a better split, getting $3600 in real value now is better than risking further devaluation
