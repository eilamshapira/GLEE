Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's settle this fairly and quickly. A 50-50 split seems the most equitable solution given our current situation. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although I could try to push for a slightly better gain in further rounds, the value of the money is decreasing significantly for me with each round due to inflation.  A 50/50 split is fair, and accepting now ensures I at least receive half of the initial amount. Holding out might force me to accept a worse offer later, ultimately losing me more money due to inflation."
