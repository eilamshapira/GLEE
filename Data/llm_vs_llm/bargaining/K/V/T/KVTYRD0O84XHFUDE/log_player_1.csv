"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I want to be fair but also ensure I get a reasonable share. Given it's the first round, I'll propose a split that's slightly in my favor, but still attractive enough for Bob to accept.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's the same offer I made, just reversed! Since we're running out of rounds, I'll accept to move things along.
