"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. I need to consider the decreasing value of the money each round. In round 1, the value is still $100. I'll try to get a good deal for myself while making it attractive enough for Bob to accept to avoid the depreciation of the money.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze.

*   **Bob's Offer:** I get $40, Bob gets $60.
*   **Value to Alice:** My $40 is worth 5% less than in round 1, so it's worth $40 * 0.95 = $38.
*   **Value to Bob:** Bob's $60 is worth 10% less than in round 1, so it's worth $60 * 0.9 = $54.

If I reject, the value of the money will decrease further in round 3. I need to decide if the potential gain from making my own offer in round 3 is worth more than the current value. Given that Bob proposed a 60/40 split in his favour, I don't think I will get a better deal proposing my own offer in round 3. The inflation hurts more than the potential bargaining gain.
