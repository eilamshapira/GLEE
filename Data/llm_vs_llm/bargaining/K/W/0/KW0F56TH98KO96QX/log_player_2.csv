"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it evenly, no need to wait 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether accepting Alice's even split offer now is better than rejecting and making my own offer next round, considering the 5% inflation penalty.

If I accept now, I get $500,000.

If I reject and propose next round, the money will be worth 5% less to me, so the full $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $950,000 to me. Even if I could get a more favorable split in the next round, I need to consider that the 5% reduction applies to my portion.

An even split seems fair, and waiting would only decrease the value of my share due to inflation.
