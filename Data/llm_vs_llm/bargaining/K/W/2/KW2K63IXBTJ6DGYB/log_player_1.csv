"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I need to make a smart offer considering that the money's value decreases for me by 20% each round, while remaining the same for Bob. I should propose something fair but favorable to me in the first round.

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. Note that if we delay, the total value decreases for me each round due to 20% inflation, while it stays the same for you. This means we both benefit from concluding early with a fair division.""}"
