4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because even with the 5% inflation you've experienced, your $4000 is worth $3800 to you, which is still a substantial amount. If you reject, we'll both lose more value in the next round. Let's end this now with both of us getting a good deal.",Bob,2,

6500.0,3500.0,"Bob, let's be rational. Due to your 20% inflation rate, your $3500 now is worth more than $4000 would be in the next round. My inflation rate is only 5%, so I can afford to wait. This 65-35 split is your best option to maximize your value.",Alice,3,
