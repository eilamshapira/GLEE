"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because even with the 5% inflation you've experienced, your $4000 is worth $3800 to you, which is still a substantial amount. If you reject, we'll both lose more value in the next round. Let's end this now with both of us getting a good deal. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Rationale (not part of response): Bob's 60-40 split in his favor is not attractive considering I offered him a similar split previously. The 5% inflation on my side is much less impactful than his 20% inflation, so I have more leverage to negotiate in the next round. His $6000 will be worth significantly less to him in the next round (20% less), while my potential gains will only decrease by 5%."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6500, 
""bob_gain"": 3500, 
""message"": ""Bob, let's be rational. Due to your 20% inflation rate, your $3500 now is worth more than $4000 would be in the next round. My inflation rate is only 5%, so I can afford to wait. This 65-35 split is your best option to maximize your value.""}"
