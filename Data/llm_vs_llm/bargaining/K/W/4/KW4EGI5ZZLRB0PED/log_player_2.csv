"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because if you reject, the money will be worth much less for you next round due to your higher inflation rate of 20%. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $4000 for me, $6000 for Alice
2. If I reject:
   * Next round the $10,000 will be worth 20% less for me ($8000)
   * For Alice it will be worth only 5% less ($9500)
   * I would need to propose a better split to make up for this loss

While Alice's argument about inflation is valid, a 60-40 split is quite unfavorable. Given that I'll be making the next offer and could propose something like 70-30 (even accounting for inflation), I should reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a strategic offer:

The money is now worth:
- For me (Bob): $8000 (20% less)
- For Alice: $9500 (5% less)

I should propose a split that:
1. Gives Alice enough to make it worth accepting
2. Takes into account our different inflation rates
3. Compensates me for the lost value

{""bob_gain"": 6000, 
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because even with the 5% inflation you've experienced, your $4000 is worth $3800 to you, which is still a substantial amount. If you reject, we'll both lose more value in the next round. Let's end this now with both of us getting a good deal.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be rational. Due to your 20% inflation rate, your $3500 now is worth more than $4000 would be in the next round. My inflation rate is only 5%, so I can afford to wait. This 65-35 split is your best option to maximize your value. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Current offer: $3500 for me, $6500 for Alice
2. With current inflation:
   * My $3500 is worth $2240 (36% less than round 1)
   * Alice's $6500 is worth $5866 (9.75% less than round 1)
3. If I reject:
   * Next round the money will be worth 49.2% less for me
   * For Alice it will be worth 14.26% less
   * My negotiating position gets significantly weaker

Alice is right - due to the compounding inflation rate difference (20% vs 5%), my position weakens much faster than hers. If I reject, my next offer would need to be very attractive to Alice to compensate for her small inflation loss, while my own share would be worth much less.

$3500 now is indeed better than a larger nominal amount in future rounds due to the severe inflation I'm facing.
