"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
- She's offering me $4,000 out of $10,000
- If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
- However, due to 5% inflation, my money would be worth less next round
- Current offer value: $4,000
- Next round effective value would be: $3,800 (5% less)
- This is a reasonable first offer, not too unfair

Given that:
1. It's a decent portion of the total
2. Inflation will reduce my gains if I delay
3. We have the risk of getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds
