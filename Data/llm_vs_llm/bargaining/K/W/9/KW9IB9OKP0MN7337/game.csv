500000.0,500000.0,"Let's split it fairly down the middle, 50-50. It's a fair start and we both get an equal share.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I propose a division that benefits us both given the discount factors: If you accept now, you'll receive $450000 (worth $405000 after your 10% discount), which is slightly more than you can secure by waiting. Let's agree now and avoid further loss in value.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Bob, considering the inflation affecting my share, I'm proposing $400000 for me and $600000 for you. This is a fair compromise given the circumstances, and it's still a good deal for you. Let's settle this now before the value decreases further for me.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
420000.0,580000.0,"Alice, in Round 4 your share is now worth roughly 70% of its face value due to inflation. I'm proposing that you receive $420000 (effectively about $294000) while I take $580000. By accepting now, you avoid even steeper devaluation in later rounds. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the circumstances. Let's settle now and both avoid further losses.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"Bob, with each round, the value of the money for me decreases significantly. I'm proposing $350000 for me and $650000 for you. This offer reflects the current situation and still gives you a substantial share. Let's end this now before my share becomes even less valuable.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
330000.0,670000.0,"Alice, with each round the devaluation on your side deepensâ€”by round 6, your share is estimated to be worth about 37% less than its nominal amount. If you wait any longer, you'll face even steeper losses, and the effective value of your share will drop further. A 330000 allocation now ensures you get more than you would by prolonging the negotiation. Let's settle at this point and both secure as much value as possible, considering the worsening inflation for you.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"Bob, we're now in round 7, and the value of the money for me has decreased significantly. I'm proposing $300000 for me and $700000 for you. This is a reasonable offer given the inflation affecting my share. Let's agree now to avoid further devaluation on my end.",Alice,7,
