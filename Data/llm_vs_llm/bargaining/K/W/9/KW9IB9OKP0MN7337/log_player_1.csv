Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose a division that benefits us both given the discount factors: If you accept now, you'll receive $450000 (worth $405000 after your 10% discount), which is slightly more than you can secure by waiting. Let's agree now and avoid further loss in value. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, in Round 4 your share is now worth roughly 70% of its face value due to inflation. I'm proposing that you receive $420000 (effectively about $294000) while I take $580000. By accepting now, you avoid even steeper devaluation in later rounds. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the circumstances. Let's settle now and both avoid further losses.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, with each round the devaluation on your side deepensâ€”by round 6, your share is estimated to be worth about 37% less than its nominal amount. If you wait any longer, you'll face even steeper losses, and the effective value of your share will drop further. A 330000 allocation now ensures you get more than you would by prolonging the negotiation. Let's settle at this point and both secure as much value as possible, considering the worsening inflation for you.
