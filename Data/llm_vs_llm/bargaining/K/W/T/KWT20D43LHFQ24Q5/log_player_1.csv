"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,

""message"": ""I suggest a fair 60-40 split in my favor, considering I made the first move in our negotiation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn, a bit more balanced, don't you think? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. If I accept Bob's offer now:
   * I get $45, but with 10% inflation = $40.50 real value
   * Bob gets $55, but with 20% inflation = $44 real value

2. If I reject and make a new offer next round:
   * The money will be worth even less (20% less for me)
   * There's no guarantee Bob will accept my next offer
   * Further delays will continue to erode the value

Bob's current offer is actually quite reasonable considering:
1. The split is close to 50-50 in real value after inflation
2. Rejecting would mean more value loss for both of us
3. The difference between our shares isn't large enough to justify the risk of another round
