"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Let me propose a fair split that accounts for the different inflation rates we face.

{""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, considering the higher inflation rate you face (20% vs my 5%), I'm offering you $400,000 now. Taking this deal immediately would be better than waiting for future rounds where your money would be worth significantly less.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it fairly, considering our inflation rates. This offer seems reasonable, and waiting might not be beneficial for either of us. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $550,000 at 95% value = $522,500 effective value
- If I reject and propose next round, any amount I get will be worth another 5% less
- Bob's offering a reasonable split considering the inflation rates
- Further negotiation might lead to less value for both of us due to compounding inflation rates
