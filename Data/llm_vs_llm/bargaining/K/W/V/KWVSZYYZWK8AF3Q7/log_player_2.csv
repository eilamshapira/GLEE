"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, considering the higher inflation rate you face (20% vs my 5%), I'm offering you $400000 now. Taking this deal immediately would be better than waiting for future rounds where your money would be worth significantly less. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the offer is $400,000 for me and $600,000 for Alice, I should consider the inflation rates. Given that my share would decrease by 20% each round, it's a significant consideration.

However, I think I can get a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, now it's my turn to make a proposal. Considering the inflation rates, I want to make a fair offer while also taking into account the decreasing value of money for both of us.

My offer is to take $450,000 and give Alice $550,000. This way, I'm acknowledging the higher inflation rate I face, but also trying to be reasonable.

""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, considering our inflation rates. This offer seems reasonable, and waiting might not be beneficial for either of us.""}"
