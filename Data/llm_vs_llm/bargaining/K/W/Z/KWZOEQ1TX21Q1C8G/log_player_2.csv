Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer, considering the inflation that will affect both of us if we delay:

```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""alice_gain"": 4500
}
```

This offer gives me slightly more, but still gives Alice a significant portion. I'm hoping it's enough to be accepted, given the declining value of the money."

```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 5700,

I'm increasing my share a bit, hoping to find a balance before we lose too much value."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, this is getting serious with the inflation. I need to be more reasonable, but also account for the fact that the value is rapidly decreasing for me.

```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 5300,
  ""alice_gain"": 4700
}
```

I'm decreasing my demand significantly, prioritizing securing *something* rather than risking everything. I hope Alice sees the urgency."
