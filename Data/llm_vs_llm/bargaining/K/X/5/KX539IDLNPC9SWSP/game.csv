550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a fair division where I get $550000 and you get $450000. Note that inflation affects me 5% per round, so if we delay, the total value decreases for me. This offer gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging my time pressure. I hope you find this reasonable.",Alice,1,
