"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a fair division where I get $550,000 and you get $450,000. Note that inflation affects me 5% per round, so if we delay, the total value decreases for me. This offer gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging my time pressure. I hope you find this reasonable.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position on inflation. I'm proposing a slightly adjusted split: $480000 for me and $520000 for you. This recognizes your time pressure while still being a favorable outcome for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
