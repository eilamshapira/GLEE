"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a fair division where I get $550000 and you get $450000. Note that inflation affects me 5% per round, so if we delay, the total value decreases for me. This offer gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging my time pressure. I hope you find this reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
