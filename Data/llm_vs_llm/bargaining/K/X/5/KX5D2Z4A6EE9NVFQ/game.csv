42.02,57.98,"Hi Bob – here’s my offer for round 1. Considering that every extra round makes money worth 5% less for me and 10% less for you, I’m proposing a deal that’s fair given our time‐discounts. I keep $42.02 and you get $57.98 if you accept now. I believe this is the best way to maximize our eventual payoffs. What do you say?",Alice,1,

40.0,60.0,"Alice, I appreciate your opening offer, but the split wasn't quite right for me. Let's be efficient with our time. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor for this round. It accounts for the increasing discount we face with each passing round and gives us both a reasonable share.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
12.5,87.5,"Hi Bob – for round 3, considering the discount factors (my money is now worth 90% of its face value and yours 80%), I’m proposing the following: you receive $87.50 (which gives you an effective value of 0.80 × 87.50 = $70) and I keep $12.50 (worth 0.90 × 12.50 = $11.25). This offer reflects what you could expect to secure in round 4 as the proposer, so accepting now helps us both avoid further devaluation. I believe this is a fair proposal given our diminishing returns. What do you think?",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
30.0,70.0,"Alice, I understand the time pressure, but your previous offer still didn't feel balanced to me.  This is a straightforward offer: 70/30 in my favor. It recognizes the devaluation but allows for a more agreeable split given we are now past the halfway point.",Bob,4,
,,"Hi Bob – I appreciate your proposal and understand the urgency, but given the discount factors, I'm concerned that a 70/30 split in your favor doesn't provide a fair balance relative to the diminishing values over the rounds. I believe we can try for a more balanced arrangement in the next round. Let's move on to round 5 and see if we can come up with a structure that reflects both our interests more equitably.",Alice,4,reject
42.0,58.0,"Hi Bob – as we enter round 5, our money has devalued further: my share is now worth about 81.45% of its face value and yours about 65.61%. To reflect this and to help us both avoid further loss in future rounds, I propose the following division: I receive $42 and you get $58. In effective terms, you'll get roughly 58 × 0.6561 ≈ $38.06 while I get 42 × 0.8145 ≈ $34.24. This offer gives you a slightly improved outcome compared to waiting for the next round, and I hope it meets you halfway. What do you say?",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
25.0,75.0,"Alice, we're running out of time, and I want to ensure we both walk away with something. I'm proposing a 75/25 split in my favor.  This factors in the significant devaluation we're facing with each passing round.  Let's settle this now.",Bob,6,
,,"Hi Bob – I appreciate your desire to resolve this quickly, but a 75/25 split really doesn't reflect a fair division when factoring in the devaluation. Given that my share is further devalued and I would effectively receive about $19.35 in today's terms, I'm not comfortable accepting that division. I believe we can reach a more balanced agreement if we try for a different split in the next round. Let's continue the negotiation.",Alice,6,reject
32.0,68.0,"Hi Bob – as we step into round 7, our funds have devalued further. At this point, each dollar I receive is worth roughly 73.5% of its face value, while each dollar you get is worth about 53% compared to round 1. With these factors in mind, I propose that I take $32 and you get $68. In effective terms, you’d receive about 68 × 0.53 ≈ $36.04 and I’d get about 32 × 0.735 ≈ $23.52. This deal aims to offer you a favorable outcome compared to the likely further losses if we continue, while recognizing the present imbalance induced by continued inflation. I hope you find this proposal acceptable so we can both avoid even steeper devaluation in the rounds to come.",Alice,7,
