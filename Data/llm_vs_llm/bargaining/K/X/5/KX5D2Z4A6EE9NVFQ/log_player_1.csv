Considering that every extra round makes money worth 5% less for me and 10% less for you, I’m proposing a deal that’s fair given our time‐discounts.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your opening offer, but the split wasn't quite right for me. Let's be efficient with our time. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor for this round. It accounts for the increasing discount we face with each passing round and gives us both a reasonable share. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60

This offer reflects what you could expect to secure in round 4 as the proposer, so accepting now helps us both avoid further devaluation. I believe this is a fair proposal given our diminishing returns. What do you think?""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the time pressure, but your previous offer still didn't feel balanced to me.  This is a straightforward offer: 70/30 in my favor. It recognizes the devaluation but allows for a more agreeable split given we are now past the halfway point.

# Bob gain: 70

Round 5

To reflect this and to help us both avoid further loss in future rounds, I propose the following division: I receive $42 and you get $58. In effective terms, you'll get roughly 58 × 0.6561 ≈ $38.06 while I get 42 × 0.8145 ≈ $34.24.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time, and I want to ensure we both walk away with something. I'm proposing a 75/25 split in my favor.  This factors in the significant devaluation we're facing with each passing round.  Let's settle this now. 
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob – I appreciate your desire to resolve this quickly, but a 75/25 split really doesn't reflect a fair division when factoring in the devaluation. Given that my share is further devalued and I would effectively receive about $19.35 in today's terms, I'm not comfortable accepting that division. I believe we can reach a more balanced agreement if we try for a different split in the next round. Let's continue the negotiation.""}"

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 32, ""bob_gain"": 68, ""message"": ""Hi Bob – as we step into round 7, our funds have devalued further. At this point, each dollar I receive is worth roughly 73.5% of its face value, while each dollar you get is worth about 53% compared to round 1. With these factors in mind, I propose that I take $32 and you get $68. In effective terms, you’d receive about 68 × 0.53 ≈ $36.04 and I’d get about 32 × 0.735 ≈ $23.52. This deal aims to offer you a favorable outcome compared to the likely further losses if we continue, while recognizing the present imbalance induced by continued inflation. I hope you find this proposal acceptable so we can both avoid even steeper devaluation in the rounds to come.""}"
