"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob – here’s my offer for round 1. Considering that every extra round makes money worth 5% less for me and 10% less for you, I’m proposing a deal that’s fair given our time‐discounts. I keep $42.02 and you get $57.98 if you accept now. I believe this is the best way to maximize our eventual payoffs. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 57.98 
# Alice gain: 42.02

""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your opening offer, but the split wasn't quite right for me. Let's be efficient with our time. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor for this round. It accounts for the increasing discount we face with each passing round and gives us both a reasonable share.""

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob – for round 3, considering the discount factors (my money is now worth 90% of its face value and yours 80%), I’m proposing the following: you receive $87.50 (which gives you an effective value of 0.80 × 87.50 = $70) and I keep $12.50 (worth 0.90 × 12.50 = $11.25). This offer reflects what you could expect to secure in round 4 as the proposer, so accepting now helps us both avoid further devaluation. I believe this is a fair proposal given our diminishing returns. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 87.5 
# Alice gain: 12.5

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob – as we enter round 5, our money has devalued further: my share is now worth about 81.45% of its face value and yours about 65.61%. To reflect this and to help us both avoid further loss in future rounds, I propose the following division: I receive $42 and you get $58. In effective terms, you'll get roughly 58 × 0.6561 ≈ $38.06 while I get 42 × 0.8145 ≈ $34.24. This offer gives you a slightly improved outcome compared to waiting for the next round, and I hope it meets you halfway. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 58 
# Alice gain: 42

""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time, and I want to ensure we both walk away with something. I'm proposing a 75/25 split in my favor.  This factors in the significant devaluation we're facing with each passing round.  Let's settle this now.""

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob – as we step into round 7, our funds have devalued further. At this point, each dollar I receive is worth roughly 73.5% of its face value, while each dollar you get is worth about 53% compared to round 1. With these factors in mind, I propose that I take $32 and you get $68. In effective terms, you’d receive about 68 × 0.53 ≈ $36.04 and I’d get about 32 × 0.735 ≈ $23.52. This deal aims to offer you a favorable outcome compared to the likely further losses if we continue, while recognizing the present imbalance induced by continued inflation. I hope you find this proposal acceptable so we can both avoid even steeper devaluation in the rounds to come. 
# Bob gain: 68 
# Alice gain: 32
