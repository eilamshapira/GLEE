"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since this is round 2, the total value of the money has decreased due to inflation. Effectively, $100 now is worth $80 (100 - 20% of 100).

Considering the decrease in value and the fact that I will make an offer in the next round, I **reject** Bob's offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, considering inflation (the initial $100 is now worth $64 - a 20% decrease from round 2's effective value of $80), here is my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```"
