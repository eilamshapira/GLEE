45.0,55.0,"I'm offering you 45%. Since your inflation rate is much higher (20% vs my 5%), you have a stronger incentive to agree now rather than wait for future rounds when the money will be worth significantly less to you.",Bob,2,

57.0,43.0,"Considering the inflation difference, this is a more reasonable split",Alice,3,

48.0,52.0,"Let's be practical about this. We're now in round 4, and your money has already lost 36% of its value while mine has only lost 9.75%. If we continue, your loss accelerates much faster than mine. This 52/48 split is fair considering our different inflation rates and gives you more total value than waiting further rounds.",Bob,4,
