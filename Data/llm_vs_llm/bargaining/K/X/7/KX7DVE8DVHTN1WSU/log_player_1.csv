Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm offering you 45%. Since your inflation rate is much higher (20% vs my 5%), you have a stronger incentive to agree now rather than wait for future rounds when the money will be worth significantly less to you. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be practical about this. We're now in round 4, and your money has already lost 36% of its value while mine has only lost 9.75%. If we continue, your loss accelerates much faster than mine. This 52/48 split is fair considering our different inflation rates and gives you more total value than waiting further rounds. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52
