"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share, considering the inflation 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer isn't balanced in our favor. Given the inflation rates (5% for me vs 20% for Alice), I should propose a better division in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm offering you 45%. Since your inflation rate is much higher (20% vs my 5%), you have a stronger incentive to agree now rather than wait for future rounds when the money will be worth significantly less to you.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation difference, this is a more reasonable split 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer still isn't balanced in our favor given the different inflation rates. While she has increased my share slightly, I can propose a better division that accounts for our different inflation rates.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Let's be practical about this. We're now in round 4, and your money has already lost 36% of its value while mine has only lost 9.75%. If we continue, your loss accelerates much faster than mine. This 52/48 split is fair considering our different inflation rates and gives you more total value than waiting further rounds.""}"
