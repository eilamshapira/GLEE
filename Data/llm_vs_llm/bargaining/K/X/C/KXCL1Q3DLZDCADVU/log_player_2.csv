"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I'll take the majority, but you get a decent chunk.  Accept, and we both get a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a strong offer considering the declining value.  Take it while it's still worthwhile!"" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you know the money is losing value with each round.  This offer is fair, and it's still a significant amount for both of us. Let's end this before it's too late! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This offer is better than my previous offer after accounting for inflation. Holding out any longer is too risky, as the potential gains will diminish further."
