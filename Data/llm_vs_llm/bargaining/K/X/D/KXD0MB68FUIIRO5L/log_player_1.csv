"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split more fairly, considering the first round's offer was too biased. We should both get close to half, but I'll take a bit more since I'm taking the risk of inflation in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
