"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. I need to consider the inflation affecting my gains while Bob's gains remain unaffected. I also need to be mindful of the 12-round limit.

Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   I'm offering Bob a slightly better split than 50/50 to incentivize him to accept it early. While I'd prefer more, the inflation is a serious concern.
*   Taking 60% in the first round means I get the full value of $60. If we go to round 2, my percentage will have to be larger to obtain the same value.
*   This offer is generous enough that Bob might accept it, as it's significantly better than what he might expect later rounds to offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob rejected my initial offer and is now proposing a 40/60 split in his favor. I need to calculate the actual value of his offer to me, considering the 20% inflation.

40$ in round 2 is worth 40 * 0.8 = 32$ in round 1.

This offer is unacceptable. I'm getting less than half of the money and my share is devalued.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, it's my turn again. Remember that my money is now worth 40% less than in round 1. This means I need to claim a significantly larger share to get a decent return.

To get at least $60 of value in round 1 money, I need to claim $60/0.6 = $100.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 100,
""bob_gain"": 0}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   I'm now claiming all of the money. This might seem greedy, but my inflation rate is significant. It is equivalent to 60$ in the beginning of the game.
*   If Bob rejects this, the inflation will continue and I will need to claim even more of the money in later rounds. It is unlikely he will accept a lower amount than he was offered previously, so there is no point in reducing the ask.

This is a risky offer, but it's necessary to try to secure some value given the constraints."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob rejected my last offer and is now proposing a 30/70 split. My money is now worth 48.8% less than in the first round. Let's calculate the value of his offer.

30$ in round 4 is worth 30 * (1-0.488) = 30 * 0.512 = 15.36$ in round 1 money.

This is a terrible offer! It is clear that Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation affecting me.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, it's my turn again. My money is now worth 59.04% less than in round 1. This is getting desperate.

To get at least $60 of value in round 1 money, I need to claim $60/(1-0.5904) = $60/0.4096 = $146.48. This is obviously impossible, so I will aim for $50.
To get $50, I need to claim $50/0.4096 = 122.07$.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 100,
""bob_gain"": 0}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   I'm claiming all the money again, even though it's still not enough to reach my initial goal. The inflation is eating away at my potential gains.
*   The value of accepting any split with Bob at this point is likely worse than getting nothing at all in the end if the game ends.

This is another all-or-nothing offer. It is likely to fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob rejected my offer and is now proposing a 20/80 split. My money is now worth 67.23% less than in the first round.

20$ in round 6 is worth 20 * (1-0.6723) = 20 * 0.3277 = 6.55$ in round 1 money.

This is an absolutely insulting offer. It's barely worth anything at this point.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, it's my turn again. My money is now worth 73.78% less than in round 1. This is beyond desperate.

To get at least $40 of value in round 1 money, I need to claim $40/(1-0.7378) = $40/0.2622 = $152.55. This is obviously impossible, so I will aim for $30.
To get $30, I need to claim $30/0.2622 = 114.42$.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 100,
""bob_gain"": 0}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   I'm still claiming all the money. The inflation is too severe to consider any other option.
*   If Bob rejects this, it will be difficult to make up the losses.

Another desperate attempt. It's unlikely to succeed. At this point, I am just trying to hold out and hope Bob makes a mistake."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob rejected my offer and is now proposing a 15/85 split. My money is now worth 79.03% less than in the first round.

15$ in round 8 is worth 15 * (1-0.7903) = 15 * 0.2097 = 3.15$ in round 1 money.

This offer is practically worthless.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, it's my turn again. My money is now worth 83.22% less than in round 1. This is almost a complete loss.

To get at least $20 of value in round 1 money, I need to claim $20/(1-0.8322) = $20/0.1678 = $119.29.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 100,
""bob_gain"": 0}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   I'm continuing to claim all the money. There is no other rational strategy given the extreme inflation.

This is likely my last chance to make any meaningful amount of money. It's a Hail Mary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob rejected my offer and is now proposing a 10/90 split. My money is now worth 86.58% less than in the first round.

10$ in round 10 is worth 10 * (1-0.8658) = 10 * 0.1342 = 1.34$ in round 1 money.

This is a completely negligible amount.

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, it's my turn again. My money is now worth 89.26% less than in round 1. It's practically worthless at this point.

To get at least $10 of value in round 1 money, I need to claim $10/(1-0.8926) = $10/0.1074 = $93.11.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 100,
""bob_gain"": 0}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   I am claiming all the money to get whatever I can. I do not expect Bob to agree.

This is almost certainly the last offer I can make. There is one round left. It is a pity that Bob has chosen to be so greedy, given the effect of the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 91.41% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob rejected my offer and is now proposing a 5/95 split. My money is now worth 91.41% less than in the first round.

5$ in round 12 is worth 5 * (1-0.9141) = 5 * 0.0859 = 0.43$ in round 1 money.

This is utterly insignificant. However, if I reject, we both get nothing.
