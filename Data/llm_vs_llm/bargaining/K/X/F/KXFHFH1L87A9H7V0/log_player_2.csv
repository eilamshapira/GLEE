"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, which I believe is fair considering we both want to reach an agreement quickly. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Currently being offered $40
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 20% inflation, any amount in the next round will be worth 20% less to me
4. If I reject and propose 60-40 in my favor next round:
   * Even if accepted, I'd get $60 but it would be worth $48 due to inflation
   * And Alice might reject anyway, leading to further rounds and more inflation

The current offer of $40 is better than risking further rounds with inflation. While a 50-50 split might seem more fair, the inflation penalty makes immediate acceptance more rational.
