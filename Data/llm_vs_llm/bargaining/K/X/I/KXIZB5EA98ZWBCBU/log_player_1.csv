"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair initial offer, considering that inflation will reduce the value of money in later rounds. I'll propose a slightly favorable split for me but still reasonable for Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose that I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. This is a reasonable split that gives both of us a substantial portion while acknowledging my first-mover position."
