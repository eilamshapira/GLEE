"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. First offer: $4,500 for me, $5,500 for Alice
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 10% inflation, any money I get next round will be worth 10% less
4. If I reject, my $4,500 would effectively become worth $4,050 next round
5. I could try to negotiate for more, but the risk might not be worth it given the inflation penalty

Given that it's a reasonable first offer (45% vs 55% split) and considering the inflation penalty, I'll accept.
