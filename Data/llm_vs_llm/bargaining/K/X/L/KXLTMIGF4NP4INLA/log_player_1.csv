"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, I need to consider the actual value of the offer. 
The original value of $550,000 is now worth $550,000 * 0.9 = $495,000 to me.
I'll compare this to what I could potentially get in the next round.
For now, I'll decide to reject the offer and try to get a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 20% less than the original value (10% less in round 2 and another 10% less in round 3), and the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than the original value (5% less in round 2 and another 5% less in round 3).

To calculate the actual value, I'll make an offer and then consider its worth after inflation.

My offer is:
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}

This means I would get $650,000, but its actual value to me would be $650,000 * 0.8 = $520,000, and Bob would get $350,000, but its actual value to him would be $350,000 * 0.95 = $332,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 30% less in total (10% in round 1, 10% in round 2, and 10% in round 3, but it is 27.1% less as per the current round), I need to consider the actual value of the offer. 
The original value of $600,000 is now worth $600,000 * 0.729 = $437,400 to me.

I'll compare this to what I could potentially get in the next round, but considering the significant decrease in value due to inflation, I might want to reconsider and accept this offer to avoid further loss.
