"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's keep it simple and fair to start. How about I take 6000 and you take 4000? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but I need a bit more. This offer is fair considering the decreasing value.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation impact, how about I take 5700 and you take 4300? It's a small adjustment, but I think it's fair. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer acknowledges the inflation, it's still skewed in her favor. The difference between our shares is widening, and accepting now would mean losing out on even more potential value in future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Alice, we need to find a compromise soon. This offer bridges the gap while acknowledging the time pressure from inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the pressure from inflation, but I think we can make a better deal. How about I take 5400 and you take 4600? 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The impact of inflation is becoming significant. While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer now secures a reasonable amount before it depreciates further.  Waiting any longer carries a higher risk of ending up with even less."
