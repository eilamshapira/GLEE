"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split it 60-40. This way, we both get a good amount before inflation reduces the value. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
- She's offering me $40 while taking $60
- While she calls it ""fair,"" a truly fair split would be 50-50
- If I reject, I can make a counter-offer, but the total value will decrease by 5%
- The initial $100 will become $95 in the next round
- I think I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more equitable offer, but I'll be diplomatic about it:

{
""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""I believe a 50-50 split is the fairest solution. We'll both walk away with equal shares, and if we agree now, we won't lose value to inflation.""
}"
