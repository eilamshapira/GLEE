"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's be fair and efficient. I suggest I get $525,000 and you get $475,000. This is close to an even split but accounts for my inflation penalty. If we keep going back and forth, we both lose value due to inflation. Let's settle this now and both walk away with a good amount.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your point about inflation, but I think your initial offer was a bit biased. Considering we both want to minimize losses due to inflation, I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to an even split from my perspective. Let's settle this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter. I notice you're facing higher inflation (20%) than I am (5%), which means we should resolve this quickly. My new offer of $520,000 for me and $480,000 for you is more balanced considering our different inflation rates. If we go another round, you'll lose significantly more value than I will. This is a fair split that acknowledges both our positions.""}"
