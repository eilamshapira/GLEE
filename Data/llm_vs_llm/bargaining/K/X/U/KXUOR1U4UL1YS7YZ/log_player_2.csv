"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's be fair and efficient. I suggest I get $525000 and you get $475000. This is close to an even split but accounts for my inflation penalty. If we keep going back and forth, we both lose value due to inflation. Let's settle this now and both walk away with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your point about inflation, but I think your initial offer was a bit biased. Considering we both want to minimize losses due to inflation, I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to an even split from my perspective. Let's settle this quickly.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counter. I notice you're facing higher inflation (20%) than I am (5%), which means we should resolve this quickly. My new offer of $520000 for me and $480000 for you is more balanced considering our different inflation rates. If we go another round, you'll lose significantly more value than I will. This is a fair split that acknowledges both our positions. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000
