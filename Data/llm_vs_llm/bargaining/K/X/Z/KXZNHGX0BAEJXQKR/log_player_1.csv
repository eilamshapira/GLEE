"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a slightly favorable split for me at $5,500 and $4,500 for you. This is fair because if we extend to another round, I'll face 10% inflation, making any future deal less valuable for me. Let's agree now and both walk away with a good amount.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's split it evenly at $5000 each. This way, we both get a fair share. Considering the inflation, it's better to settle now rather than risking more value loss in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer from Bob.

If I accept Bob's offer of $5000, due to the 10% inflation affecting me in this round, the $5000 would be worth $4500 to me (equivalent to $5000 Ã— 0.9).

If I reject and we go to another round, I'd face additional inflation, and I'd have to make a new offer that Bob would have to accept.

Since this is a fair 50-50 split in nominal terms, and Bob has informed me that his inflation rate is higher than mine (20% vs my 10%), this seems like a reasonable compromise.
