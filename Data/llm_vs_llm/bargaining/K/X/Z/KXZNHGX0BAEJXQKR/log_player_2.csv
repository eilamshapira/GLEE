"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a slightly favorable split for me at $5500 and $4500 for you. This is fair because if we extend to another round, I'll face 10% inflation, making any future deal less valuable for me. Let's agree now and both walk away with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
