"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Taking inflation into account, the $100 is now worth effectively $95 for me (100 - 5% of 100). Therefore, the offer from Bob is equivalent to giving me $45, which is less than half of the money that is worth $95 for me. I **reject** this offer.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for round 3. Since I've already rejected Bob's offer and inflation is eating away at my potential gains, I will try to propose an offer that favors me more.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's calculate. In round 1, the $100 was worth 100%. Now, with 14.26% inflation, $100 is worth 100 - 14.26 = 85.74 for me.

Bob's offer gives me $48. Is $48 greater than 85.74/2?  Yes, because 85.74 / 2 = 42.87.

Therefore, considering inflation and the fact that this is more than half of the current value of the money for me, I will **accept** Bob's offer.

```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```"
