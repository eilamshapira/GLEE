"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since this is the first round, I'll make a reasonable offer to divide the $100. I'll propose a 50-50 split, which is a fair and common starting point for negotiations.

Here's my offer in JSON format:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly and end the game quickly!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's make it worth our while. Deal? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I need to consider the actual value of Bob's offer.

In the first round, $40 would be worth $40 to me. However, in the second round, due to 20% inflation, the $40 offered by Bob is equivalent to $40 * 0.8 = $32 in the first round's value.

Considering this, I think I can do better than that. I'll reject Bob's offer and wait for the next round, hoping to negotiate a better deal.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's now my turn to make a proposal again. Considering the inflation, the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round, and 36% less than in the first round (1 - 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.36).

To calculate the equivalent value, I'll use the following:
$1 in round 1 = $1
$1 in round 2 = $0.8
$1 in round 3 = $0.8 * $0.8 = $0.64

I'll aim to get at least 55% of the original $100, which would be worth around $55 * 0.64 = $35.2 to me in this round. However, I'll propose a slightly lower amount to increase the chances of Bob accepting.

Here's my offer in JSON format:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement before it's too late!""
}
```"
