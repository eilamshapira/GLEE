55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I propose a slightly higher share for me since I face a 10% inflation penalty in each round. This way we can both walk away with a fair amount, considering the inflation effect on my end.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
42.0,58.0,"Considering your 10% inflation penalty, I'm offering a slightly higher share for myself. This should still be beneficial for you given the circumstances.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
60.0,40.0,"Bob, due to the 10% inflation penalty I face each round, I need a higher share for it to be fair. If we keep going back and forth, the value keeps decreasing for me, which isn't optimal for either of us. This offer accounts for approximately two rounds of inflation and should be fair given the circumstances.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
45.0,55.0,"Alice, considering the inflation penalty you're facing, I've revised my offer to give you a larger share. This should be more appealing given the current round and the decreasing value for you.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
65.0,35.0,"Bob, we're now in round 5, and due to inflation, each dollar I receive is worth about 34% less than in round 1. If we continue rejecting offers, we both lose value. This offer accounts for the significant inflation penalty I'm facing. Let's end this now so we both walk away with something worthwhile.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
40.0,60.0,"Alice, I understand the inflation penalty is significantly impacting your share. I've made a slight adjustment to my offer, hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement before it's too late for both of us.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
70.0,30.0,"Bob, we're at round 7 now. My inflation penalty is nearly 47%, meaning $70 for me is effectively worth only about $37 in original value. If we continue this pattern, we'll both end up with nothing after round 12. This offer is fair considering my severe inflation penalty, and I strongly suggest we conclude this negotiation now.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
50.0,50.0,"Alice, I understand the inflation penalty is severely impacting your share. I'm willing to compromise and offer a 50:50 split, considering the current round and the significant decrease in value for you. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement before it's too late.",Bob,8,
