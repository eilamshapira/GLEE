"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a slightly higher share for me since I face a 10% inflation penalty in each round. This way we can both walk away with a fair amount, considering the inflation effect on my end. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Alice has proposed a division where I get $45 and she gets $55, and considering that I don't know how her inflation penalty affects her perception of the value, but I do know I have 0% inflation penalty, I should evaluate if this offer is reasonable for me given that I have 12 rounds to negotiate.

Given that I have no inflation penalty, I should aim to get as much as possible, but I also need to consider the risk of not reaching an agreement within the 12 rounds, which would result in both of us getting nothing.

In the first round, it might be beneficial to reject the offer and see how Alice reacts in the next round, hoping to get a better deal. However, $45 is a significant amount, and immediately accepting it guarantees me some money.

Considering these factors, my decision for this round is:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, now it's my turn to make a proposal. Considering that Alice has a 10% inflation penalty and I have 0%, I should try to take advantage of this situation by proposing a division that slightly favors me but is still reasonable enough for Alice to consider, given her penalty.

My proposal for this round is to give Alice $42 and keep $58 for myself. This offer is slightly more favorable to me than Alice's initial proposal but still leaves her with a significant amount, especially considering her inflation penalty.

Here's my offer in the required JSON format:

{""bob_gain"": 58,
""alice_gain"": 42,
""message"": ""Considering your 10% inflation penalty, I'm offering a slightly higher share for myself. This should still be beneficial for you given the circumstances.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, due to the 10% inflation penalty I face each round, I need a higher share for it to be fair. If we keep going back and forth, the value keeps decreasing for me, which isn't optimal for either of us. This offer accounts for approximately two rounds of inflation and should be fair given the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that Alice has rejected my previous offer and now proposes a division where I get $40 and she gets $60, I need to consider the impact of her 10% inflation penalty per round. Since she mentions that this offer accounts for approximately two rounds of inflation, it implies she's trying to find a middle ground that considers her diminishing returns due to inflation.

However, from my perspective, with no inflation penalty, I should aim to maximize my gain. Accepting an offer that gives me $40 means I'm giving up $60 to Alice, which might not be the best strategy for me, especially since I know that her perception of the value decreases with each round due to her inflation penalty.

Considering that we are only in Round 3 and I have 9 more rounds to negotiate, I believe I can potentially get a better deal. Alice's urgency to find a fair deal due to her inflation penalty might work in my favor if I continue to negotiate.

Therefore, my decision for this round is:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice's offer was rejected, it's now my turn again to propose a division. Given that Alice faces a 10% inflation penalty per round and we are in Round 4, the value of the money for her has decreased significantly compared to the start. For me, the value remains the same.

Considering Alice's situation and my own, I should try to find a balance that takes into account her diminishing returns but also maximizes my gain. Since she has already proposed a 40:60 split in her favor in Round 3, I can try to improve upon my previous offer to see if we can find a mutually acceptable agreement.

My proposal for this round is to give Alice $45 and keep $55 for myself. This offer is more generous than my previous one but still favors me, considering my lack of inflation penalty.

Here's my offer in the required JSON format:

{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Alice, considering the inflation penalty you're facing, I've revised my offer to give you a larger share. This should be more appealing given the current round and the decreasing value for you.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're now in round 5, and due to inflation, each dollar I receive is worth about 34% less than in round 1. If we continue rejecting offers, we both lose value. This offer accounts for the significant inflation penalty I'm facing. Let's end this now so we both walk away with something worthwhile. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that Alice has rejected my previous offer and now proposes a division where I get $35 and she gets $65, it's clear that she's trying to secure a deal as soon as possible due to the significant impact of inflation on her share. The fact that the money she gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round puts her in a more urgent position to agree on a division.

From my perspective, with no inflation penalty, I have the luxury of waiting for a better offer. However, I also need to consider the risk of not reaching an agreement within the 12 rounds, which would result in both of us getting nothing. Given that we are halfway through the negotiation rounds, the risk of not agreeing starts to become more significant.

Accepting an offer of $35 is less favorable to me than my previous proposals, but considering Alice's desperate situation due to inflation, it might be the best I can get if I continue to negotiate. On the other hand, $35 is still a substantial amount, and guaranteeing this amount might be wiser than risking getting nothing if negotiations fail.

Given these considerations, my decision for this round is:

{""decision"": ""reject""} 

I'm willing to take the risk for a potentially better offer, considering my advantage with no inflation penalty."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice's offer was rejected, it's now my turn again to propose a division. Given that Alice faces a significant inflation penalty, with her share being worth 34.39% less than in the first round, and we are in Round 6, I should try to capitalize on my advantageous position.

However, I also need to be mindful that Alice might become increasingly desperate and less willing to negotiate if she feels she's not getting a fair deal, considering her diminishing returns. My goal is to find a balance that maximizes my gain while still being reasonable enough for Alice to consider accepting, given her situation.

My proposal for this round is to give Alice $40 and keep $60 for myself. This offer is slightly more generous than my previous one but still favors me, considering the significant inflation penalty Alice is facing and my lack of one.

Here's my offer in the required JSON format:

{""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the inflation penalty is significantly impacting your share. I've made a slight adjustment to my offer, hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement before it's too late for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're at round 7 now. My inflation penalty is nearly 47%, meaning $70 for me is effectively worth only about $37 in original value. If we continue this pattern, we'll both end up with nothing after round 12. This offer is fair considering my severe inflation penalty, and I strongly suggest we conclude this negotiation now. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that Alice has rejected my previous offer and now proposes a division where I get $30 and she gets $70, it's clear that she's under significant pressure due to her inflation penalty. With her share being worth 46.86% less than in the first round, she's essentially receiving less than half the original value for her portion.

From my perspective, accepting $30 is a very unfavorable outcome, considering I could potentially negotiate for a better split. However, Alice's message highlights the urgency of the situation, and the risk of not agreeing on a division before the 12th round is becoming more pronounced.

Given that Alice's inflation penalty is nearly 47%, and she's willing to accept a deal that, in her words, is effectively worth much less to her, it suggests she's at a point where she's willing to compromise significantly to avoid getting nothing. This could be an opportunity for me to secure a better deal, but it also means I need to be cautious not to push her too far, or she might decide that walking away is better than accepting an even worse offer.

Considering these factors, my decision for this round is:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I believe I can still negotiate for a better offer, given Alice's desperate situation and my advantageous position with no inflation penalty."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice's offer was rejected, it's now my turn again to propose a division. Given the significant inflation penalty Alice is facing, with her share being worth 46.86% less than in the first round, I should try to make an offer that is reasonable enough for her to consider, while still maximizing my gain.

Considering Alice's situation, where she mentioned that $70 for her is effectively worth only about $37 in original value due to the nearly 47% inflation penalty, I understand that she is under a lot of pressure to agree on a deal. My goal is to find a balance that takes into account her desperation while ensuring I get the best possible outcome.

My proposal for this round is to give Alice $50 and keep $50 for myself. This offer is more generous than my previous ones, acknowledging the severe impact of inflation on Alice's share. By offering a 50:50 split, I'm signaling a willingness to compromise and find a middle ground that could be acceptable to both of us, given the current circumstances.

Here's my offer in the required JSON format:

{""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the inflation penalty is severely impacting your share. I'm willing to compromise and offer a 50:50 split, considering the current round and the significant decrease in value for you. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement before it's too late.""}"
