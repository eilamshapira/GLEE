"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, 50/50. Fair for both! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer is 50/50, which seems fair at first glance
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, in the next round the $50 I could get would be worth only $47.50 to me
4. Even if I made a more aggressive offer next round, Alice might reject it, leading to further rounds and more value loss
5. Given the inflation penalty, getting $50 now is better than trying to negotiate for slightly more but losing value to inflation

Therefore, I'll accept this fair offer.
