"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we settle now with a near-even split: I take $5200 and you get $4800. This helps us avoid any delay—remember, each round reduces my share's value by 5%. I believe it’s a fair deal for both. Let’s close this early and secure our gains!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was tempting, but I'm confident we can find a slightly more equitable split. How about we try $5100 for me and $4900 for you? 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
