"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we settle now with a near-even split: I take $5200 and you get $4800. This helps us avoid any delay—remember, each round reduces my share's value by 5%. I believe it’s a fair deal for both. Let’s close this early and secure our gains! 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200
