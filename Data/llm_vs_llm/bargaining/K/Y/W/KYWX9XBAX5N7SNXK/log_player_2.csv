"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4737 
# Alice gain: 5263 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer. Alice is proposing a split where I (Bob) get $4,737 while she gets $5,263. That's about a 47%-53% split in her favor. 

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but the money will be worth 10% less, meaning we'd be dividing $9,000 effectively. I could propose a more favorable split for myself, but Alice could also reject.

Given that this is a reasonable first offer (not too far from 50-50) and considering the 10% inflation penalty for waiting, I'll accept.
