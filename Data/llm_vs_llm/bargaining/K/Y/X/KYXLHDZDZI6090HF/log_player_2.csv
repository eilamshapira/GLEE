"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, the money is now worth 20% less to me, so the total amount I consider is 100 * 0.8 = $80.
To maximize my gain, I'll make a proposal where I get a bit more than half of the original $100, considering the reduced value.
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 66.67 
# Alice gain: 33.33 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 100 * 0.8 * 0.8 = $64, and since I'm getting $66.67, its actual value to me is 66.67 * 0.64 = $42.67.
Given Alice's offer, I'll accept it since it seems reasonable and I don't know how the inflation affects Alice's perception of the value.
