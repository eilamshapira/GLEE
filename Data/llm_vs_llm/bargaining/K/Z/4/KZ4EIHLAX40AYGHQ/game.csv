600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, let's split the $1000000 with me receiving $600000 and you getting $400000. I believe this is a fair offer considering I made the first proposal. What do you think?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
1.0,999999.0,"Alice, I appreciate your spirit. However, given that further rounds will cost you 20% per round while my share remains undiminished, delaying will only hurt your payoff. Accepting this offer, although it gives you a token amount now, is better than risking nothing in subsequent rounds. Please accept and end the negotiation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
480000.0,520000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm willing to adjust my offer considering the inflation impact on my side. How about you take $520000 and I receive $480000? This is a fair split considering the circumstances. Let’s close this deal!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
1.0,999999.0,"Alice, with every round, the value you receive drops further. At round 4, your dollars are worth only about 51% of their initial value. If you reject this offer, you'll get to propose in round 5, but you'll be forced to concede almost the entire pie to me in order for Bob to accept—leaving you effectively with nothing. I'm giving you $1 now, which is more than what you'll secure if we delay any further. Please accept this offer and let's close the deal.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
260000.0,740000.0,"Hi Bob, I understand the diminishing value of my share, but to keep things reasonable given the current situation, I'll take $260000 while offering you $740000. This way, you receive a substantial portion and we can finally reach an agreement. Let's conclude this deal!",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
325000.0,675000.0,"Alice, here's my proposal for round 6: I take $675000 and you receive $325000. Remember that by round 6, each of your dollars is worth only about 32.8% of what it was in round 1. In effect, your $325000 is equal to roughly $106500 in round-1 value—the same effective benefit you aimed for in your previous rounds. Further delay will only erode your share even more. I believe this offer is a balanced compromise given the inflation penalty you face. Please accept, and let’s put an end to this negotiation.",Bob,6,
