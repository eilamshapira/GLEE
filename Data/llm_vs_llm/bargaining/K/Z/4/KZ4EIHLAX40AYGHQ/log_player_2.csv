"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split the $1000000 with me receiving $600000 and you getting $400000. I believe this is a fair offer considering I made the first proposal. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 999999, ""alice_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your spirit. However, given that further rounds will cost you 20% per round while my share remains undiminished, delaying will only hurt your payoff. Accepting this offer, although it gives you a token amount now, is better than risking nothing in subsequent rounds. Please accept and end the negotiation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm willing to adjust my offer considering the inflation impact on my side. How about you take $520000 and I receive $480000? This is a fair split considering the circumstances. Let’s close this deal! 
# Bob gain: 520000 
# Alice gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 999999, ""alice_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Alice, with every round, the value you receive drops further. At round 4, your dollars are worth only about 51% of their initial value. If you reject this offer, you'll get to propose in round 5, but you'll be forced to concede almost the entire pie to me in order for Bob to accept—leaving you effectively with nothing. I'm giving you $1 now, which is more than what you'll secure if we delay any further. Please accept this offer and let's close the deal.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand the diminishing value of my share, but to keep things reasonable given the current situation, I'll take $260000 while offering you $740000. This way, you receive a substantial portion and we can finally reach an agreement. Let's conclude this deal! 
# Bob gain: 740000 
# Alice gain: 260000

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 675000, ""alice_gain"": 325000, ""message"": ""Alice, here's my proposal for round 6: I take $675,000 and you receive $325,000. Remember that by round 6, each of your dollars is worth only about 32.8% of what it was in round 1. In effect, your $325,000 is equal to roughly $106,500 in round-1 value—the same effective benefit you aimed for in your previous rounds. Further delay will only erode your share even more. I believe this offer is a balanced compromise given the inflation penalty you face. Please accept, and let’s put an end to this negotiation.""}"
