"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to think this through. I'm being offered 50% of the money, which is a fair split. Since there's no inflation for me, I'd still get the same value in future rounds. However, Alice faces 5% inflation each round, so her money would be worth less if we delay.

If I reject and propose in the next round, I could potentially ask for more than 50%. Since Alice faces inflation, she might accept a less favorable deal to avoid further devaluation of her share.

Given this game theory perspective, I should reject this first offer to gain negotiating leverage.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's fair 50-50 split, I should propose a division that accounts for Alice's inflation penalty while still being reasonable enough for her to accept. Given that Alice faces 5% inflation per round, she has incentive to accept a deal now rather than risk further devaluation.

If Alice rejects my offer, we'll move to round 3, where her money would be worth another 5% less. I can use this to justify asking for slightly more than 50%.

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I propose this division because it acknowledges the inflation asymmetry while not being so extreme that Alice would certainly reject it."
