"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a slightly favorable split for me, but still fair enough that Bob might accept, considering the inflation risk.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose: ""I'll take $55, and you'll get $45. This is a fair split considering we both risk losing value with inflation if we delay."""
