"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly and avoid risk 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully given the 5% inflation penalty per round.

If I accept now, I get $50.
If I reject and make a counter-offer, the money will be worth 5% less to me, and Alice may or may not accept my counter-offer.

An even split is fair, and given the inflation penalty, it's likely better to accept now rather than risk potentially lower returns in later rounds.
