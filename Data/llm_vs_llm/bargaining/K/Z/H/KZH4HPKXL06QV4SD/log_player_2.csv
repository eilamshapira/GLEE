"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer. 60/40 split, favoring me slightly since I'm making the initial offer. We can negotiate from here. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000 (40%)
2. If I reject, in the next round:
   - I can make a counter-offer
   - But the money will be worth 10% less to me ($3,600 equivalent)
   - I don't know how inflation affects Alice

While 40% isn't ideal, getting $4,000 now is better than risking a prolonged negotiation where my purchasing power decreases each round. If we go back and forth too much, we might both end up with nothing.
