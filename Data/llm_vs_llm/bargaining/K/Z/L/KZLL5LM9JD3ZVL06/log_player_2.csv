"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether it's fair to accept $40 out of $100. Alice is offering me a 40/60 split, which is less than half. While I'd prefer a more equal division, I should keep in mind that I'll get to make a counter-offer in the next round if I reject. Since there's no inflation for me, I don't lose value by continuing to negotiate. Let me try for a better offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a more equitable split while still giving Alice a small advantage to increase the chances she'll accept.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing an equal split of the $100. This is fair to both of us and represents an even division of the money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice Alice has improved her offer from $40 to $45 for me, and I also see that she's facing significant inflation (36%) while I'm not affected by inflation. This means each round is more costly for her than for me, which gives me some negotiating advantage.

Since I'm not affected by inflation, I can afford to continue negotiating for a better deal. Alice's improved offer suggests she's willing to move toward a more equitable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice is facing significant inflation (36% already) and has shown willingness to move toward a more equitable split, I'll propose a slightly better offer for myself while still being reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'm proposing I receive $55 and Alice receives $45. Given the inflation pressure Alice is facing and the fact that we've already gone through several rounds, this offer provides a path to conclude our negotiation with a fair division that acknowledges our respective positions."
