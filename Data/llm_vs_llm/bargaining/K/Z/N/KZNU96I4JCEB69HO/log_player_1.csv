"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing we settle quickly to avoid the inflation penalty. I'd receive $6000 while you get $4000. I believe this split is fair given our need to lock in value now. Let me know your thoughts!""}"

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it equally to avoid further devaluation. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Bob, I agree that splitting the pot equally in this round is our best move to minimize losses from inflation. Let's finalize the deal.""}"
