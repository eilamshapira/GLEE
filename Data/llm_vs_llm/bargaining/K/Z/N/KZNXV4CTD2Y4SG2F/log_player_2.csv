"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I think we should get a more even split considering the inflation. How about this?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, inflation is hurting both of us. I'm offering you $40, which is still a decent amount considering the circumstances. Let's end this now. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is even worse for me than the first one, considering the inflation. It's better to hold out and see if I can negotiate a better deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, this inflation is getting out of hand. Let's just split it evenly and call it a day. A 50/50 split is the fairest option at this point.""}"
