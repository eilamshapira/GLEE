"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me think strategically here. Since Bob faces a steeper depreciation (20% per round) compared to my 5%, he has more pressure to accept a reasonable offer early. However, I also want to be fair enough that he's likely to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This gives Bob a significant portion while acknowledging my stronger negotiating position due to the different depreciation rates. If Bob rejects this, his share will be worth 20% less next round, while mine only loses 5% value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. If I accept:
   * I get $5000, but it's worth 5% less than round 1, so effectively $4750
   * Bob gets $5000, but it's worth 20% less than round 1, so effectively $4000 for him

2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make another offer
   * But my money will be worth another 5% less
   * And Bob's will be worth another 20% less
   * This gives me leverage for the next round

While this is a 50-50 split nominally, it's actually better for me than Bob due to the different inflation rates. It's a reasonable offer, and dragging this out might lead to worse outcomes for both of us due to continued depreciation.
