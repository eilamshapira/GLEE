"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $512820 and you get $487180. Given that waiting costs us 5% each round, this split reflects our rational, time‚Äêdiscounted shares. I hope you agree so we can both secure our payouts immediately. 
# Bob gain: 487180 
# Alice gain: 512820 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $487,180 and keeping $512,820
2. The 5% inflation penalty per round is significant
3. If I reject:
   * Next round value would be $950,000 (5% less)
   * Even if I propose a more favorable split next round, the total amount to divide would be smaller
4. The split is relatively close to 50-50 (48.7% vs 51.3%)
5. The time value loss makes accepting a reasonable near-50/50 split now better than trying to negotiate for more later

Given these factors, especially the significant inflation penalty and the relatively fair split, I'll accept this offer.
