"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'd like to propose an even split right awayâ€”$500000 each. Acting now avoids any inflation losses on my side, and it's a fair, quick solution for both of us. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing an even 50/50 split, which would give me $500,000. That's a substantial amount, but I should consider the inflation factor.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value will be worth 5% less to me, meaning the $1,000,000 pot would effectively be worth $950,000 to me. Even if I could get a larger percentage in the next round, I need to weigh that against this reduction in value.

Since this is a fair initial offer that gives me half of the full value without any inflation penalty, I'll accept it.
