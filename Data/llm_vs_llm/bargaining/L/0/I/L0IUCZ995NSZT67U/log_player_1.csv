"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This offers me a slightly larger share, but still gives Bob a significant portion of the money. I hope he finds it acceptable, especially considering the decreasing value of the money for him in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this offer. Bob is offering a 50/50 split. Since the money is worth the same to me as in round 1, this is objectively better than my initial offer to him. Therefore, I will accept.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
