"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

If I reject, we move to the next round where:
1. I get to make the offer
2. The money is worth 20% less to me and 10% less to Alice

Current offer gives me $400,000.
If I wait one round, any amount I propose will be worth 20% less to me. So to get the same value as $400,000 now, I would need to propose receiving $500,000 in the next round.

While I could propose a better split for myself in the next round, Alice might reject it, leading to further rounds and more value loss for both of us.

Given that I'm getting a substantial portion (40%) and the risk of losing value in future rounds, I should accept this offer.
