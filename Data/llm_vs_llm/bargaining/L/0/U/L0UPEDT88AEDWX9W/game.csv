45.0,55.0,"Alice, if we wait another round, the value decreases further for both of us—5% for me and 10% for you. I propose this split to help us both secure as much value as we can now. Let's settle and avoid further losses!",Bob,2,

31.0,69.0,"Alice, notice how the inflation affects us differently—as each new round passes, my share loses only 5% of its value while yours drops 10%. This means that by waiting, you wouldn't be able to secure a better deal. In fact, if you reject this offer and propose in round 5, you'll end up with a similar effective value despite the extra discount. With that in mind, I propose a division of $69 for me and $31 for you. Accepting now ensures you lock in this value without risking further losses.",Bob,4,

50.0,50.0,"Alice, with each round the value on your side deteriorates faster than mine. If you hold out and become the proposer in Round 7, you'll face an even steeper 10% per round discount (about 47% devaluation by then), which would leave you with less real value even if you secure a nominal advantage. A 50/50 split in Round 6 safeguards both our interests—ensuring you get about 50 * 0.59049 = 29.52 effective dollars, which is slightly better than what you might achieve by risking further devaluation. Let's settle now and avoid the extra loss.",Bob,6,
