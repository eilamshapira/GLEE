Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, if we wait another round, the value decreases further for both of us—5% for me and 10% for you. I propose this split to help us both secure as much value as we can now. Let's settle and avoid further losses!

# Bob gain: 55

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, notice how the inflation affects us differently—as each new round passes, my share loses only 5% of its value while yours drops 10%. This means that by waiting, you wouldn't be able to secure a better deal. In fact, if you reject this offer and propose in round 5, you'll end up with a similar effective value despite the extra discount. With that in mind, I propose a division of $69 for me and $31 for you. Accepting now ensures you lock in this value without risking further losses. 
# Alice gain: 31 
# Bob gain: 69

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, with each round the value on your side deteriorates faster than mine. If you hold out and become the proposer in Round 7, you'll face an even steeper 10% per round discount (about 47% devaluation by then), which would leave you with less real value even if you secure a nominal advantage. A 50/50 split in Round 6 safeguards both our interests—ensuring you get about 50 * 0.59049 = 29.52 effective dollars, which is slightly better than what you might achieve by risking further devaluation. Let's settle now and avoid the extra loss. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50
