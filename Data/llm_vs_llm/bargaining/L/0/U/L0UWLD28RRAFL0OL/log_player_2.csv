"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
- Alice is offering me $400,000 and keeping $600,000
- If I reject, the next round will have 5% inflation for me
- After inflation, my $400,000 would be worth $380,000
- I would need to make a better proposal next round
- While this isn't an even split, it's a substantial amount and avoiding inflation is valuable
- First round offers tend to be strategic starting points

Given the significant inflation penalty and the decent initial offer, I'll accept.
