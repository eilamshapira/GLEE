"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a fair initial offer while considering that Bob loses more value than I do in future rounds due to higher inflation on his end.

{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I propose a reasonable split considering we both lose value if we delay. You lose more than I do each round, so this is actually favorable for you to accept now.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that.  Let's split it more evenly, with me taking a slight edge since I lose more value each round. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Due to inflation, if I accept now:
   * My $450,000 is worth 95% of original value = $427,500
   * Bob's $550,000 is worth 90% of original value = $495,000

2. If I reject, next round I can make a new offer, but:
   * Money will be worth another 5% less for me
   * Money will be worth another 10% less for Bob
   * This gives me negotiating leverage

3. Bob's current offer gives me less than my original offer gave him, and I have a stronger inflation position.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since we're now in round 3, both parties have lost more value due to inflation. I'll adjust my offer accordingly while maintaining pressure based on Bob's higher inflation rate.

{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Bob, consider that your money is now worth only 80% of the original value, while mine is worth 90%. If we continue further, you'll lose even more value. This split actually gives you more real value than continuing to negotiate.""
