"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a reasonable split considering we both lose value if we delay. You lose more than I do each round, so this is actually favorable for you to accept now.

# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, consider that your money is now worth only 80% of the original value, while mine is worth 90%. If we continue further, you'll lose even more value. This split actually gives you more real value than continuing to negotiate. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
