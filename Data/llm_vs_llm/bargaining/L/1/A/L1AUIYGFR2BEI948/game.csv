5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 50-50 split which is fair for both of us. Let's avoid the inflation penalties by agreeing early.",Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. Since inflation affects you more than me (10% vs 5%), I'm proposing a 55-45 split that accounts for this difference. This way we can still finish early and minimize our combined losses to inflation. This is fair considering our different inflation rates.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, I understand your point about inflation, but your proposal was too skewed. The inflation difference doesn't justify such a large shift. This 52-48 split is more reasonable while acknowledging our different inflation rates. Let's agree now before we both lose more value.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4700.0,5300.0,"Alice, I appreciate you adjusting your offer, but I'm still concerned about the division. With your proposed split, after accounting for our current inflation rates, I'd effectively get $4332 in original value while you'd get $4212. As we continue, inflation will impact you more significantly. This 53-47 split is fair considering our different inflation rates and provides us both with similar effective value after inflation. Let's agree now to prevent further value loss.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5100.0,4900.0,"Bob, we're losing value with each round. Your last offer was still too weighted in your favor. This 51-49 split is a reasonable compromise that acknowledges the inflation difference while being fair to both of us. Let's finalize this deal now - further delays will only hurt us both significantly.",Alice,5,
