"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a fair offer to Bob considering our mutual interest in reaching an agreement.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. Since inflation affects you more than me (10% vs 5%), I'm proposing a 55-45 split that accounts for this difference. This way we can still finish early and minimize our combined losses to inflation. This is fair considering our different inflation rates. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your point about inflation, but your proposal was too skewed. The inflation difference doesn't justify such a large shift. This 52-48 split is more reasonable while acknowledging our different inflation rates. Let's agree now before we both lose more value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you adjusting your offer, but I'm still concerned about the division. With your proposed split, after accounting for our current inflation rates, I'd effectively get $4332 in original value while you'd get $4212. As we continue, inflation will impact you more significantly. This 53-47 split is fair considering our different inflation rates and provides us both with similar effective value after inflation. Let's agree now to prevent further value loss. 
# Alice gain: 4700 
# Bob gain: 5300

This 51-49 split is a reasonable compromise that acknowledges the inflation difference while being fair to both of us. Let's finalize this deal now - further delays will only hurt us both significantly.""}"
