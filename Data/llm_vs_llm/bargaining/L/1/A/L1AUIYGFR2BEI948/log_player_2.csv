"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 50-50 split which is fair for both of us. Let's avoid the inflation penalties by agreeing early. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing an even 50-50 split, which would give us each $5000. However, I should account for the inflation penalties. If I reject and we go to the next round, my money will be worth 5% less, while Alice's will be worth 10% less. This gives me some negotiating advantage in later rounds.

While a 50-50 split seems fair on the surface, I can potentially get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round, especially since inflation affects Alice more severely than me.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. Since inflation affects you more than me (10% vs 5%), I'm proposing a 55-45 split that accounts for this difference. This way we can still finish early and minimize our combined losses to inflation. This is fair considering our different inflation rates.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point about inflation, but your proposal was too skewed. The inflation difference doesn't justify such a large shift. This 52-48 split is more reasonable while acknowledging our different inflation rates. Let's agree now before we both lose more value. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer carefully. She's now proposing I get $4800 while she gets $5200.

Due to inflation, the money is now worth 9.75% less to me than in round 1, meaning my $4800 is effectively worth $4,332 of the original value. For Alice, with 19% inflation, her $5200 is effectively worth $4,212 of the original value.

While Alice has moved from her original 50-50 split, she's now asking for more than she's offering me. Given that inflation affects her more severely, and we still have many rounds left where this difference will become more pronounced, I should continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5300, ""alice_gain"": 4700, ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you adjusting your offer, but I'm still concerned about the division. With your proposed split, after accounting for our current inflation rates, I'd effectively get $4,332 in original value while you'd get $4,212. As we continue, inflation will impact you more significantly. This 53-47 split is fair considering our different inflation rates and provides us both with similar effective value after inflation. Let's agree now to prevent further value loss.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're losing value with each round. Your last offer was still too weighted in your favor. This 51-49 split is a reasonable compromise that acknowledges the inflation difference while being fair to both of us. Let's finalize this deal now - further delays will only hurt us both significantly. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully analyze Alice's latest offer in round 5.

With the current inflation rates:
- My $4900 is worth 18.55% less than round 1 value, making it worth about $3,991 in original value
- Alice's $5100 is worth 34.39% less than round 1 value, making it worth about $3,346 in original value

Despite Alice asking for a higher nominal amount ($5100 vs my $4900), due to the compounding inflation effect affecting her more severely, she would actually be getting less effective value than I would.

This seems like a reasonable compromise given our different inflation rates, and further delays will indeed continue to reduce the total value for both of us.
