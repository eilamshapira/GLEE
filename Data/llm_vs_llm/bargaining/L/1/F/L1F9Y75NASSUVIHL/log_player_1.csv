"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it equally. It's fair and we both walk away with a good amount. Consider the impact of inflation if we keep delaying. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the impact of inflation, I should act quickly. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I'll calculate the actual value of Bob's offer:

Original value: $500,000
Inflation reduction: 5% of $500,000 = $25,000
Actual value: $500,000 - $25,000 = $475,000

Given that the alternative is to wait and risk further inflation, I think Bob's offer is reasonable.
