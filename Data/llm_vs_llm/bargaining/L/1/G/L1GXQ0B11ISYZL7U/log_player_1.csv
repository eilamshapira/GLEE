"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn, a bit more balanced! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $4500, but it's worth 20% less than the original value. So, the actual value I'll get is $4500 * 0.8 = $3600.

Since this is the first offer I've received, I'll consider it. However, I think I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each round, and 5% less for Bob, I'll try to make a more appealing offer to Bob while still being mindful of my own decreasing value.

In Round 1, the value for me was 100%. In Round 2, it was 80%. Now, in Round 3, it's 80% * 0.8 = 64% of the original value for me. For Bob, it was 100% in Round 1, 95% in Round 2, and now 95% * 0.95 = 90.25% in Round 3.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Equal split, considering the inflation hit!""}"
