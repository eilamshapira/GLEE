"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice is offering me $40 out of $100, I need to consider that rejecting means delaying the payoff while inflation could affect Alice's willingness to accept my counter-offer in the next round.

Since the prompt mentions that inflation makes the money worth 0% less for me (meaning no actual inflation for me), but I don't know how inflation affects Alice, I'll make a strategic decision.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair proposal that slightly benefits Alice while ensuring I get a reasonable share.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing an equal split of the $100. This is a fair division that respects both of our interests. A 50-50 split is the most equitable solution and should be acceptable to both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I now have important new information - Alice is facing 36% inflation on her gains since the first round, while I face no inflation. This explains why she rejected my 50-50 split and is now offering me a better deal than her first offer.

Given that Alice is now offering me $45 (up from her initial $40 offer), and considering the inflation pressure she's facing, this seems like a reasonable compromise. If I reject again, we'll go to another round where inflation will further reduce the real value of Alice's share, potentially making her even more desperate but also reducing the total value of our transaction.
