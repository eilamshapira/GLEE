"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's have a fair start. I take the majority, but you'll still get a significant amount. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me $100,000 out of the $1,000,000 (10% of the total). If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but the money will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation.

This first offer seems quite low - Alice is taking 90% for herself. Since this is just the first round and the inflation penalty isn't too severe yet, I think I can reject this and try to negotiate a better deal.

In the next round, I can propose a more balanced split, and even with the 10% inflation penalty, I could potentially get more value.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split, considering that Alice has no inflation penalty while I face 10% inflation in this round.

{""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""I propose a more balanced split. You get a slight majority since you don't face inflation, but this is much fairer than your initial offer.""}"
