4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I need to consider mine as well. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This way, we both get a fair share, and we can avoid the risk of losing more to inflation in future rounds.",Bob,2,

6000.0,4000.0,"Bob, I appreciate your previous offer, but with my 20% inflation penalty per round, I need a better share to compensate. I'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, which is more balanced than my first proposal. This gives you a substantial $4000 while allowing me to offset some of my inflation losses. Let's settle this now before inflation reduces our collective value further.",Alice,3,
