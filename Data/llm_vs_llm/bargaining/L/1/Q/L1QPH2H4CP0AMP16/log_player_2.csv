"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor. Since I face 20% inflation each round, waiting costs me significantly. Let's make a deal now and both walk away with something substantial. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

However, I need to consider mine as well. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This way, we both get a fair share, and we can avoid the risk of losing more to inflation in future rounds.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your previous offer, but with my 20% inflation penalty per round, I need a better share to compensate. I'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, which is more balanced than my first proposal. This gives you a substantial $4000 while allowing me to offset some of my inflation losses. Let's settle this now before inflation reduces our collective value further. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
