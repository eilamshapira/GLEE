Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 55

I'm still holding out for a better deal. While the money is losing value, I believe Alice will be more open to a fairer split as we get closer to the deadline."

I'm sticking with a 50/50 split. It's fair, and hopefully, Alice will see that before the money loses too much more value."
