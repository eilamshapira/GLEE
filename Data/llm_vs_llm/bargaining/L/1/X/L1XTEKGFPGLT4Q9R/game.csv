16.82,83.18,"Hi Bob – here’s my proposal based on our future prospects. If you reject, waiting will cost both of us, and as you know, my money devalues by 20% each round while yours only by 5%. Accepting now guarantees you about $83.18 (in today’s value), whereas waiting will only risk a lower overall amount. Let’s seal the deal and avoid unnecessary losses!",Alice,1,

10.0,90.0,"Alice, I understand your perspective on the devaluation, but I believe we can find a more equitable split. This offer ensures you still receive a portion, while allowing me a larger share. Let's reach a fair agreement and avoid further losses.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, I appreciate your effort to come to an agreement. However, considering that if I reject this offer I’ll have the opportunity to propose in Round 3—and given that my estimated continuation value in equilibrium is higher—I must decline. With my $10 now equating to about $8 in today’s terms (due to the 20% devaluation) and my anticipated proposal yielding more value, I prefer to wait for Round 3. Let’s continue the negotiation.",Alice,2,reject
9.0,91.0,"Bob, here’s my proposal for Round 3: I take $9 and you get $91. I know that by rejecting offers we both incur further losses—my share is discounted by 36% relative to Round 1 (down to 0.64), while your share is discounted by only about 9.75% (down to 0.9025). Given that you'll have the opportunity to propose in Round 4 if you reject, you’d aim to secure nearly the full pie. However, this delay would only offer you roughly 91 × 0.9025 ≈ $82.2 in Round‐1 value, and I’d be left with even less when my severe discount is applied. Accepting now avoids further devaluation for both of us. I believe this offer reflects our negotiated future prospects fairly, and I hope you’ll agree.",Alice,3,
