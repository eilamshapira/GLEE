"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob – here’s my proposal based on our future prospects. If you reject, waiting will cost both of us, and as you know, my money devalues by 20% each round while yours only by 5%. Accepting now guarantees you about $83.18 (in today’s value), whereas waiting will only risk a lower overall amount. Let’s seal the deal and avoid unnecessary losses! 
# Bob gain: 83.18 
# Alice gain: 16.82

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, here’s my proposal for Round 3: I take $9 and you get $91. I know that by rejecting offers we both incur further losses—my share is discounted by 36% relative to Round 1 (down to 0.64), while your share is discounted by only about 9.75% (down to 0.9025). Given that you'll have the opportunity to propose in Round 4 if you reject, you’d aim to secure nearly the full pie. However, this delay would only offer you roughly 91 × 0.9025 ≈ $82.2 in Round‐1 value, and I’d be left with even less when my severe discount is applied. Accepting now avoids further devaluation for both of us. I believe this offer reflects our negotiated future prospects fairly, and I hope you’ll agree. 
# Bob gain: 91 
# Alice gain: 9
