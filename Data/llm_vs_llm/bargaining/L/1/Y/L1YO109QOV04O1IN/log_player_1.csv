"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I'm Alice and I need to make an offer in Round 1, I'll propose a fair division while considering the asymmetric time pressure Bob faces due to his 20% inflation penalty per round.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose a 50-50 split of the $10,000. This is a fair and equal division that benefits us both immediately, allowing us to avoid the inflation penalty that would affect Bob in future rounds."
