"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the inflation, I propose we reverse the split from your last offer. This way, we both still get a fair share, but it's my turn to have a slight advantage. Let's settle this quickly before the value drops further. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
