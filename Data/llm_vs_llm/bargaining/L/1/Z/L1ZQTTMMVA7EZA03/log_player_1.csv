"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

  ""alice_gain"": 60,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I believe a 55-45 split in my favor is fair considering the game dynamics. Let's agree on this before the rounds progress further. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is losing value for me and Bob rejected a relatively close offer, I need to consider a more attractive offer for him while still trying to secure a reasonable amount for myself.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48,
  ""message"": ""Bob, okay, I understand you want a bit more. How about 52 for me and 48 for you? This is a better offer, let's take it before we both lose out to inflation.""
