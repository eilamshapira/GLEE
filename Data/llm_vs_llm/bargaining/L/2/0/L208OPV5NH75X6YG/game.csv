60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, let's split this reasonably. I propose a 60/40 split, giving me slightly more to account for the decreasing value to me over time. This is a fair offer for round 1.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
35.0,65.0,"Alice, since the money loses value for you each round but not for me, a 65/35 split is actually fair. If you accept now, your $35 is worth more than getting $35 or even slightly more in future rounds due to the 10% loss per round. Let's make a deal now to avoid further devaluation for you.",Bob,2,
