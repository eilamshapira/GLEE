Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, since the money loses value for you each round but not for me, a 65/35 split is actually fair. If you accept now, your $35 is worth more than getting $35 or even slightly more in future rounds due to the 10% loss per round. Let's make a deal now to avoid further devaluation for you. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
