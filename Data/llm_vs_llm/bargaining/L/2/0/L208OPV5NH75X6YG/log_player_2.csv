"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split this reasonably. I propose a 60/40 split, giving me slightly more to account for the decreasing value to me over time. This is a fair offer for round 1. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is proposing I get $40, while she gets $60
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. For Alice, the money loses 10% value each round
4. For me, there's no value loss per round
5. If Alice gets $60 now, that's better for her than getting $60 in the next round (which would be worth $54 to her)
6. However, I could propose a more favorable split next round, and she might accept due to the time pressure

Given that I don't lose value over time and Alice does, I have a stronger negotiating position. I should be able to get a better deal by rejecting this and making a counter-offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a split that acknowledges Alice's time pressure while getting a better deal for myself:

{""bob_gain"": 65,
""alice_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Alice, since the money loses value for you each round but not for me, a 65/35 split is actually fair. If you accept now, your $35 is worth more than getting $35 or even slightly more in future rounds due to the 10% loss per round. Let's make a deal now to avoid further devaluation for you.""}"
