"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. I will propose a division of the $100.

Here's my offer in JSON format:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the situation. I need to decide whether to accept Bob's offer.

Here's my calculation:

*   **My Inflation Adjustment:** Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I need to calculate the real value. My gain from round 1 is worth 80% of its initial value.

*   **Round 2 Value:** My gain from round 2 is worth 80% of its initial value.

*   **Decision:** Given these considerations, I will evaluate the offers in terms of their real value.

Here's my decision in JSON format:

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I need to make a new offer. Remember, my money is worth 20% less than the previous round.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55
}
```"
