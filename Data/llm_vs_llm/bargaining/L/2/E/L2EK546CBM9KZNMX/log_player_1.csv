"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Based on a backward‐induction (Rubinstein bargaining) analysis where we account for the fact that after every round the money “loses value” (5% per round for Alice and 10% for Bob), if we denote as follows:

 • Let δA = 0.95 be Alice’s “discount factor” per round.
 • Let δB = 0.90 be Bob’s “discount factor” per round.

Then when Alice makes an offer in Round 1, she wants to offer Bob just enough so that he is indifferent between accepting now and waiting for his own proposal in Round 2. In the subgame we can denote:

 Alice’s payoff as proposer in Round 1: A = 1,000,000 – (offer given to Bob)
 Bob’s continuation “value” (in Round 1–equivalent dollars) when he would be proposer in Round 2 is denoted B.

Because Bob’s money loses 10% per round, if Bob were to wait, his eventual nominal outcome in Round 2 would be “discounted” when compared with an immediate payout. In equilibrium we would require:
 (1) When Alice is proposer in Round 1, she leaves Bob exactly δB · B.
  Thus, A = 1,000,000 – δB · B.
 (2) When Bob is proposer (in Round 2), he would give Alice exactly δA · A so that she is indifferent to waiting.
  Thus, B = 1,000,000 – δA · A.

Substitute the values δA = 0.95 and δB = 0.90, we get:
 A = 1,000,000 – 0.90 · B   (1)
 B = 1,000,000 – 0.95 · A   (2)

Substitute (1) into (2):
 B = 1,000,000 – 0.95 · (1,000,000 – 0.90 · B)
   = 1,000,000 – 950,000 + 0.855 · B
   = 50,000 + 0.855 · B

Then,
 B – 0.855 · B = 50,000 ⟹ 0.145 · B = 50,000
 ⟹ B ≈ 344,827.59

Now plug back into (1):
 A = 1,000,000 – 0.90 · 344,827.59
  ≈ 1,000,000 – 310,344.83
  ≈ 689,655.17

Thus, in Round 1 Alice’s equilibrium proposal is to keep approximately 689,655.17 dollars for herself and offer Bob approximately 310,344.83 dollars. (These numbers are in nominal dollars. The “discounted” values reflect the fact that if Bob waits, his money is worth less.)
