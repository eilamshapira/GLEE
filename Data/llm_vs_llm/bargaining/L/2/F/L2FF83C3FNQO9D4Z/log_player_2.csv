"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100 
# Alice gain: 9900 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer gives me only $100 out of the $10,000, which is extremely unfavorable. I'd be better off rejecting and making my own proposal in the next round, even with the 20% inflation effect.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to make a reasonable offer that Alice would accept, considering that if she rejects, she faces her own inflation penalty in the next round. I'll propose a more balanced split while accounting for the 20% inflation I've already incurred.

{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500}

I'm offering Alice a slight advantage with $5,500 compared to my $4,500. This is fair considering I've already lost 20% value due to inflation, and if she rejects, she'll face her own inflation penalty in the next round. This proposal gives us both substantial value while acknowledging the time pressure we both face."
