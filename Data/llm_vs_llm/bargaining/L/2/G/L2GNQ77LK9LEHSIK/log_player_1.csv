"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's keep it simple and fair. A 50/50 split ensures we both benefit significantly. This way, we avoid the risk of inflation eroding our potential gains in later rounds. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer of a 50-50 split. Even with the 20% inflation from round 1, this is still a very good deal for both of us, and continuing to negotiate would only reduce our gains further due to inflation. We'll each get $500,000 (worth 80% of what it would have been in round 1, but still a substantial amount)."
