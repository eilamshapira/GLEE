"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000 of the $10,000.

Important factors to consider:
- If I reject, I can make my own offer next round
- With each round, the money loses 10% of its value for Alice, but keeps the same value for me
- This gives me increasing leverage as rounds progress
- We have 12 rounds total to reach agreement

Since this is only round 1 and I don't lose value with time, I'll reject this offer to propose a more favorable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a strategic offer that takes into account the game dynamics. Since Alice faces 10% depreciation each round while I don't, I have an advantage in later rounds. However, I also want to make a reasonable offer that Alice might accept.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering a split where I receive $5,500 and Alice receives $4,500. This is more favorable to me than Alice's initial offer, but still gives her a substantial amount. I think this is fair considering the time-based disadvantage Alice faces in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's new offer. She's proposing I get $4,200 while she gets $5,800 of the $10,000.

Important factors to consider:
- Alice has increased my share by $200 compared to her first offer
- For Alice, the money has already lost 19% of its value since round 1
- If we continue to later rounds, Alice's money will depreciate further
- I don't face any depreciation, giving me stronger negotiating position

Since Alice's offer still gives her a significantly larger share and my position strengthens with each passing round, I'll reject this offer to propose a more favorable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more strategic offer considering the game progression. Alice now faces a 27.1% depreciation in the next round if she rejects my offer (10% more than the current 19% depreciation). This gives me increasing leverage.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering a split where I receive $6,000 and Alice receives $4,000. This is more favorable to me than my previous offer, reflecting my strengthening position due to Alice's time-based disadvantage. However, it still gives Alice a significant portion of the money, which would be worth considering given the continued depreciation she'll face if we move to later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's new offer. She's proposing I get $4,400 while she gets $5,600 of the $10,000.

Key considerations:
- Alice has increased my share by $200 compared to her previous offer (and $400 from her first offer)
- For Alice, the money has already lost 34.39% of its value since round 1
- Her $5,600 is effectively worth only about $3,674 in round 1 value to her
- If we continue, Alice's money will depreciate even further
- I don't face any depreciation, strengthening my position with each round

Given that we're in round 5 of 12 and my negotiating position continues to improve, while Alice's offer still gives her a larger share, I'll reject to propose a more favorable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll create an offer that considers our current position in the game. Alice now faces 40.95% depreciation (34.39% + another 10%) if she rejects my offer. We're halfway through the possible rounds, and her bargaining position continues to weaken while mine strengthens.

{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500}

I'm offering a split where I receive $6,500 and Alice receives $3,500. This further shifts the balance in my favor compared to my previous offer, reflecting the game dynamics. For Alice, rejecting this offer means her next potential gain would depreciate even more, making this $3,500 potentially more valuable than a larger nominal amount in future rounds. This offer balances my advantageous position while still giving Alice enough incentive to accept rather than risk further depreciation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's latest offer carefully. She's proposing I get $4,600 while she gets $5,400 of the $10,000.

Key considerations:
- Alice has increased my share by $200 compared to her previous offer (now $600 more than her first offer)
- For Alice, the money has already lost 46.86% of its value since round 1
- Her $5,400 is effectively worth only about $2,869 in round 1 value to her
- We're now in round 7 of 12, with 5 rounds remaining
- Alice's money will continue to depreciate significantly with each passing round
- My position continues to strengthen as her money loses more value

Given that we're past the halfway point, Alice's money has lost nearly half its value to her, and my negotiating position is quite strong, I'll reject this offer to propose an even more favorable split for myself.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","As we enter round 8 of 12, I need to make a strategic offer that reflects the increasing pressure on Alice due to her time-based disadvantage. If she rejects my offer, her money will depreciate to be worth 52.17% less than round 1 value.

{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000}

I'm offering a split where I receive $7,000 and Alice receives $3,000. This continues to shift the balance in my favor, reflecting my increasingly stronger negotiating position. For Alice, this $3,000 now is worth more than a larger nominal amount in future rounds due to the accelerating depreciation. With only a few rounds remaining and the risk of both of us getting nothing if we don't reach agreement by round 12, this offer represents a reasonable compromise considering the game dynamics."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's latest offer. She's proposing I get $4,800 while she gets $5,200 of the $10,000.

Key considerations:
- Alice has increased my share by $200 compared to her previous offer (now $800 more than her first offer)
- For Alice, the money has already lost 56.95% of its value since round 1
- Her $5,200 is effectively worth only about $2,239 in round 1 value to her
- We're now in round 9 of 12, with only 3 rounds remaining
- Alice's money will continue to depreciate significantly with each passing round
- We're approaching the deadline where both of us get nothing if we don't reach an agreement

Given that we're in the final quarter of available rounds, Alice's money has lost over half its value to her, and my negotiating position is very strong, I'll reject this offer to propose an even more favorable split for myself.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","As we enter round 10 of 12, the urgency to reach an agreement increases significantly. Alice now faces 61.26% depreciation if she rejects my offer, and we only have 3 rounds left (including this one) before both of us get nothing.

{""bob_gain"": 7500, ""alice_gain"": 2500}

I'm offering a split where I receive $7,500 and Alice receives $2,500. This reflects my extremely strong negotiating position at this late stage. For Alice, this $2,500 now is worth approximately $968 in round 1 value, but accepting it is better than risking further depreciation or potentially getting nothing at all if we reach round 12 without agreement.

With the deadline approaching and the severe depreciation Alice faces, this offer balances my advantageous position while still giving Alice rational incentive to accept rather than risk either a worse deal in subsequent rounds or no deal at all."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 65.13% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's latest offer. She's proposing an even 50-50 split where I get $5,000 while she also gets $5,000 of the $10,000.

Key considerations:
- Alice has increased my share by $200 compared to her previous offer (now $1,000 more than her first offer)
- For Alice, the money has already lost 65.13% of its value since round 1
- Her $5,000 is effectively worth only about $1,743 in round 1 value to her
- We're now in round 11 of 12 - this is the penultimate round
- If we don't reach agreement in the next round, both of us get nothing
- Alice's proposal is a significant concession showing she understands the time pressure

Given that we're now in the second-to-last round, the risk of both of us getting nothing is very real, and Alice has moved to an even split despite her severe disadvantage, I should carefully consider accepting.

However, since I still have one more round to negotiate and my position is extremely strong, I'll make one final attempt to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 11.
Round 12
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","We've now reached the final round (round 12 of 12). This is the last opportunity for us to reach an agreement before both of us get nothing. At this point, Alice's money has depreciated by 68.62% from round 1 value.

Given the extreme time pressure and the fact that Alice moved to a 50-50 split in the last round, I need to make a final offer that has a high probability of being accepted while still leveraging my advantageous position.

{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000}

I'm offering a split where I receive $7,000 and Alice receives $3,000. This is slightly more moderate than my previous offer, acknowledging the risk of getting nothing if Alice rejects. For Alice, this $3,000 now is worth approximately $942 in round 1 value, but it's still better than getting nothing at all.

This final offer balances my strong negotiating position while giving Alice a meaningful portion that should motivate her to accept rather than have us both walk away with nothing."
