"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me 4000$ and keeping 6000$ for herself
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 10% inflation, the total amount will be worth only 9000$ next round
4. My 4000$ now is better than potentially getting 4500$ next round (due to inflation)
5. While not perfectly equal, this is a reasonable offer
