"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the inflation. Let's calculate:

*   **My potential gain in this round, relative to round 1:** $60 (offer from round 1) becomes worth 80% of its original value. So, in terms of the initial value, it's equivalent to 0.8 * $60 = $48

Now, I need to evaluate Bob's offer:

*   **Bob's offer:** Alice gains $45.

So, considering the inflation, here's my decision:

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
