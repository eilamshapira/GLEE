550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a fair split where I get $550000 and you get $450000. I'm facing 20% inflation per round, so it's in my interest to settle quickly. This offer gives you a substantial amount while acknowledging my inflation pressure. I hope we can agree now rather than drag this out.",Alice,1,
