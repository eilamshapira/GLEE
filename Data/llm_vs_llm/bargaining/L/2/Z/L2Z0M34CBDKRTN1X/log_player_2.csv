"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 83.18 
# Alice gain: 16.82 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether I should accept this offer, I need to consider the value of the money after the first round. Since the money is worth 5% less for me with each passing round, and 20% less for Alice, I'll calculate the effective value for both of us if we were to accept this offer now.

For me (Bob), the $83.18 is worth its face value in this round because it's the first round, so no depreciation has occurred yet for me.

However, I must think about the future rounds and the depreciation. Given that the offer significantly favors me, I should consider whether waiting could potentially yield a better outcome or if the risk of losing value due to inflation (or in this case, depreciation) outweighs the potential benefits of negotiating further.

Given the significant difference in depreciation rates (5% for me vs. 20% for Alice), it might be beneficial for me to accept an offer that favors me early on, as Alice's share devalues much quicker.

Considering these factors, my decision for this round is:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
