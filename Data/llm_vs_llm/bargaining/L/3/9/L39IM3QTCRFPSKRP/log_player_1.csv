"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get your money immediately without any inflation impact.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay Alice, let's try a more balanced approach. I propose a 50/50 split. Take it or leave it - inflation is eating away at my share! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 20% inflation for me, $50 is now worth effectively $40 to me.
In the next round, I could propose again, but my share would be worth another 20% less.

The current offer gives me $40 in effective value, which is less than my initial proposal but still substantial. If I reject and the game continues, the inflation will keep reducing the real value of any future agreement.
