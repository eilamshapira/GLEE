"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if this offer is fair, given the inflation factor.

Alice is offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000 total. If I reject this offer, I can make a counteroffer in the next round, but the money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation.

If I reject now, the $1,000,000 will effectively be worth $800,000 to me in the next round. So even if I proposed a better split for myself in the next round, I'd need to factor in this reduction.

Given this inflation pressure, getting $400,000 now is better than potentially getting a larger nominal amount that's worth less in the future.
