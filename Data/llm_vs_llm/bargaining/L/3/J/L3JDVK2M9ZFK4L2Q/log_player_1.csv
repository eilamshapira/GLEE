"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split since it's the first round, though I need to consider the possibility of future rounds and unknown inflation effects on Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose we split the money equally, 50-50. This is a fair division that respects both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Bob is offering me $40 and keeping $60 for himself
2. Due to inflation, Bob's $60 is actually worth $57 to him (60 * 0.95)
3. My $40 maintains its full value
4. If I reject, we go to another round, but I don't know how inflation will affect Bob in future rounds
5. $40 is less than my initial fair offer, but not drastically unfair

While I could reject and make another offer, there's risk in continuing, and $40 is still a substantial amount. The difference isn't large enough to risk further rounds.
