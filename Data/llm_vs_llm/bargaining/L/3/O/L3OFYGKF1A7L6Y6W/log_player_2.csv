"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly. Fair play, right? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value will be worth 10% less to me (so $9,000 total value from my perspective). Even if I managed to get a better split next round, I'd need to get significantly more than $5,000 to make up for that 10% loss.

$5,000 is a fair 50-50 split of the original amount, and accepting now means I avoid any loss from inflation.
