"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that Bob's money will be worth 20% less each round, I should make a strategic first offer. If Bob rejects, his potential gains will decrease in value for him. However, I also don't want to be too aggressive and risk him rejecting.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, giving me $600,000 and Bob $400,000. This is a reasonable first offer that acknowledges Bob's time pressure while still securing a good portion for myself."
