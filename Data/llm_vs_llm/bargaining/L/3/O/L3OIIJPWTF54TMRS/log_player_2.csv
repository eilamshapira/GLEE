"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think through this offer. Alice is offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000.

I need to consider the inflation effect. If I reject and we move to the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me. So in the next round, the $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $800,000 to me. This means I would need to get at least $500,000 in the next round to match what Alice is offering now ($400,000).

Since I'll be making the offer in the next round, I could potentially get a better deal. However, Alice could reject my offer, and we'd lose another 20% of value for me.

Given the significant inflation penalty and the reasonable initial offer (40% of the total), I'll accept this offer.
