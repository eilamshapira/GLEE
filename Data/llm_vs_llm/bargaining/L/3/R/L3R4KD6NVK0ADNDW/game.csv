55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that accounts for the inflation penalty I face. I'll take $55 and you get $45. If we go to the next round, the total value decreases for me due to inflation, which would hurt us both. This is a reasonable offer that leaves us both with a substantial amount.",Alice,1,
