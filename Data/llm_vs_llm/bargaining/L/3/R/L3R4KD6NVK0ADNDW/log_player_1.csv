"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll approach this game strategically, considering the 5% inflation penalty I face each round.

{""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that accounts for the inflation penalty I face. I'll take $55 and you get $45. If we go to the next round, the total value decreases for me due to inflation, which would hurt us both. This is a reasonable offer that leaves us both with a substantial amount.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation penalty affects you more, I've adjusted the split to still be somewhat fair but also reflects my advantage in this situation. If we continue, your share will only decrease in value. 
# Alice gain: 43 
# Bob gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
