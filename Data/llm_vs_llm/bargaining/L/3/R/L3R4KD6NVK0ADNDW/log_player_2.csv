"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that accounts for the inflation penalty I face. I'll take $55 and you get $45. If we go to the next round, the total value decreases for me due to inflation, which would hurt us both. This is a reasonable offer that leaves us both with a substantial amount. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
