"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000. This is a 40-60 split in her favor.

If I reject and we move to the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation. So the $10,000 pot would effectively be worth only $8,000 to me in the next round. If I were to propose a 50-50 split in the next round, I'd get $5,000, but with the 20% inflation, that's effectively $4,000 in current value.

Given that rejecting doesn't seem to offer a clear advantage and could potentially lead to worse outcomes if negotiation continues with increasing inflation, I'll accept this offer.
