"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a slightly favorable split for myself since Bob's money devalues more slowly than mine, giving him an advantage in later rounds. I'll offer a fair but decisive split.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable split that gives both of us a substantial portion, while accounting for my higher inflation rate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. With 10% inflation for me, $40 is now worth $36 to me
2. With 5% inflation for Bob, $60 is now worth $57 to him
3. If I reject and we go to next round:
   - My money will depreciate another 10%
   - Bob's money will depreciate another 5%
   - I'll have another chance to make an offer, but with significantly devalued money
4. The current split, while not ideal, gives me a guaranteed $36 in value

Given the asymmetric inflation rates working against me, and the risk of further devaluation, I should accept this offer rather than risk getting even less value in future rounds.
