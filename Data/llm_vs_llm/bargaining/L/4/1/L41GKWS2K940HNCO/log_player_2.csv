"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice has offered a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance. However, I need to consider that:

1. If I reject, I can make my own offer next round
2. But the money will be worth 20% less to me next round
3. There's no guarantee Alice will accept a better offer from me
4. If I reject, $5000 now becomes worth $4000 to me next round

Given that it's a fair split and the significant inflation penalty, I should accept this offer. Getting $5000 now is better than risking getting less value in future rounds.
