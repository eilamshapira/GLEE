5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, I appreciate your focus on fairness. Let's meet in the middle with a 55-45 split in my favor. Remember, with each round, inflation affects both of us, so it's in our best interest to reach an agreement soon.",Alice,3,

5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, let's end this now with a perfect 50-50 split. We've both lost value due to inflation already, and continuing this back-and-forth will only hurt us both. This is completely fair and allows us both to walk away with equal amounts.",Alice,5,
