Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, in round 2, I'll make an offer, keeping in mind the inflation. Since this is round 2, the money is worth 20% less for me. I need to get a good deal to compensate for that loss.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's round 4, and the inflation is really starting to hurt me. It's (1 - 0.8^3) = 48.8% less valuable for me than the original amount. Alice is only losing 14.26% of the value of her money. I need to make a proposal that considers both the decreasing value of the money and the increasing risk of further rounds. I will propose a split that gives me a larger share.
