"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is the first round, and Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000, which means she would keep $6,000. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but the total value will decrease by 5% due to inflation, making the pot worth $9,500 to me.

I need to consider if I can get a better deal in the next round, even accounting for inflation. If I counter with a more favorable split for myself, Alice might reject, leading to further rounds and more inflation.

$4,000 now is better than potentially less in future rounds if negotiations drag on. However, I believe I can propose a more equitable split in the next round that Alice might accept.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll aim for a more balanced split that still accounts for inflation. Since we're now in round 2, the total value has decreased by 5% for me (though I don't know how inflation affects Alice). I want to propose a fair split that Alice is likely to accept to avoid further rounds of inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an equal 50-50 split of the original amount. This is fair and should be attractive to Alice compared to continuing negotiations with further inflation risk."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I now have important new information: Alice faces much steeper inflation penalties (36% by round 3) than I do (9.75% by round 3). This explains her behavior - she rejected my fair 50-50 split because time pressure affects her more severely.

Alice is now offering me $5,000, which is the same split I proposed in round 2. Given that:
1. The same amount is worth less to both of us now due to inflation
2. If I reject, my next counter-offer would be based on further reduced value
3. Alice's inflation penalty is much higher than mine, so she has stronger incentive to conclude the deal now
4. This is a fair 50-50 split of the original amount

Taking all factors into consideration:
