"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer is a fair 50-50 split of the $1,000,000, with each of us getting $500,000. Since there's no inflation for me (0% less value per round), there's no pressure for me to accept immediately due to decreasing value. However, this is a perfectly fair division.
