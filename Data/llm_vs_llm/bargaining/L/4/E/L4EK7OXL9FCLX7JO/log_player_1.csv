"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I think 55-45 is a more reasonable split, as the money is worth less to you in each subsequent round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
* My $45 is now worth $42.75 due to 5% inflation
* If I reject and we go to round 3, any amount I get will be worth another 5% less
* Bob's argument about inflation is valid - waiting longer reduces my actual value
* Getting $42.75 in real value now is better than risking further depreciation
