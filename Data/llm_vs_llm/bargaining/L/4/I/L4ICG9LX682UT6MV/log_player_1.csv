"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, which gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging my role as the first mover.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This ensures both of us get a fair share while accounting for the decreasing value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think this through:

1. Bob is offering me $45
2. Bob would get $55, but it's worth 5% less to him due to inflation
3. If I reject, we go to another round where I can make an offer, but Bob's value will decrease further
4. $45 for me now is better than risking further negotiation where Bob might be less willing to accept due to increasing inflation on his side
5. This is actually a reasonable offer given the circumstances
