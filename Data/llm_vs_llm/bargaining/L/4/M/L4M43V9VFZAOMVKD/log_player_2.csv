"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's keep it fair and split the money equally. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. This is a fair 50-50 split offer
2. If I reject, we move to next round where:
   * The $10,000 total will be worth 20% less to me
   * It will be worth 10% less to Alice
   * But I get to make the next offer

3. If I reject, the $10,000 would be worth:
   * $8,000 for me
   * $9,000 for Alice
   * Even if I propose a more favorable split next round, I might not end up better off than taking $5,000 now

4. A 50-50 split in round 1 is quite fair, and trying to negotiate for more could leave me worse off due to the higher inflation rate I face.
