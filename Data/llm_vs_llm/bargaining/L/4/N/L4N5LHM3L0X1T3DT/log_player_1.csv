"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 50-50 split. This is fair for both of us. Considering the inflation I will face, waiting for more rounds might be riskier for me than for you. Let's end this game and both walk away with equal shares. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 20% inflation for me, the $500,000 offered is effectively worth $400,000 in round 1 terms.

In round 1, I offered myself $600,000 which Bob rejected. If we continue to round 3, I'll face another 20% inflation penalty, making any gains worth even less.

While $400,000 (in round 1 value) is less than what I initially wanted, it's still a significant amount, and continuing the game could lead to worse outcomes due to compounding inflation effects on my side.
