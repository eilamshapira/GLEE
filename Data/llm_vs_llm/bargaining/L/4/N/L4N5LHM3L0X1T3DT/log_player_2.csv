"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to avoid inflation eating into our gains. If you reject, you'll lose 20% value next round. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
