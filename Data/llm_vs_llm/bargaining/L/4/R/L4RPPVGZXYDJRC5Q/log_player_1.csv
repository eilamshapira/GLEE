"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"":80,""bob_gain"":20,""message"":""Let's start with a fair division. How about I take 80% and you take 20%?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think a more equitable split would be 60/40 in my favor. You have a higher inflation rate (20% vs my 5%), so it's in your interest to reach an agreement sooner. This offer gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging our different positions. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
