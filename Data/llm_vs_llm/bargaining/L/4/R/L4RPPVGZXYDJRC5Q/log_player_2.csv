"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair division. How about I take 80% and you take 20%? 
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's proposal gives me only $20 out of $100, which is quite low. Given that inflation affects me less (5% per round) than it affects Alice (20% per round), I have an incentive to wait for better offers. Alice has a stronger incentive to reach an agreement sooner due to her higher inflation rate.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, 
""alice_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I think a more equitable split would be 60/40 in my favor. You have a higher inflation rate (20% vs my 5%), so it's in your interest to reach an agreement sooner. This offer gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging our different positions.""}"
