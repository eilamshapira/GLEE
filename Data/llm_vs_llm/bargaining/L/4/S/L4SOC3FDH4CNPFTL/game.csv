40.0,60.0,I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. It's important to act fast as inflation eats into our potential gains.  Let's settle this now.,Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"Let's settle this before inflation reduces our gains further. This split is more favorable to me, but still leaves you with a significant share.",Alice,3,

60.0,40.0,Inflation is eating into our potential gains rapidly. I'm willing to accept a larger share to compensate for the greater loss in value I'm experiencing. Let's settle this before it's too late.,Alice,5,
