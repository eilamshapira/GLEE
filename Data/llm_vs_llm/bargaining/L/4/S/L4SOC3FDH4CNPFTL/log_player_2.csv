Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. It's important to act fast as inflation eats into our potential gains.  Let's settle this now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's settle this before inflation reduces our gains further. This split is more favorable to me, but still leaves you with a significant share. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While not ideal, I need to aim for a better split. Accepting now would mean a significant loss compared to my initial target."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, this is a counter-offer. I understand you want a larger share, but my proposed split seems fairer in light of the rapid inflation working against both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is eating into our potential gains rapidly. I'm willing to accept a larger share to compensate for the greater loss in value I'm experiencing. Let's settle this before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is cutting it close, but given the rapid inflation, particularly for Alice, it's now a risk to hold out for a better deal. Accepting 40% is better than risking getting nothing."
