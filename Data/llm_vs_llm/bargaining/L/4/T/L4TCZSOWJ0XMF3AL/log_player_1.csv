"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair initial offer that considers the future rounds and inflation risk.

I propose a 50-50 split of the $1,000,000, which gives each of us $500,000. This is a fair division that respects our equal positions in the negotiation. Given the 5% inflation penalty for each passing round, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement early."
