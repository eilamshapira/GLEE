Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I propose a 50/50 split which is truly fair for both of us. I'm facing 10% inflation each round, so prolonged negotiation hurts me significantly. This even split benefits us both equally and allows us to conclude quickly. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
