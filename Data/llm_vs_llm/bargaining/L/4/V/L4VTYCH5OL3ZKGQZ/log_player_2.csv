"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, Bob. A 60/40 split seems reasonable for us to both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. A 60/40 split would give me $4,000 while Alice gets $6,000. Given that we have 12 rounds maximum and each round decreases the value by 10% for me, rejecting means I'd get 90% of whatever amount in the next round.

If I make a counter-offer next round, I might be able to get a better deal. However, there's also risk in prolonged negotiation due to the inflation penalty.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced counter-offer while acknowledging the inflation pressure I face.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I propose a 50/50 split which is truly fair for both of us. I'm facing 10% inflation each round, so prolonged negotiation hurts me significantly. This even split benefits us both equally and allows us to conclude quickly.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation pressure, but 50/50 isn't quite fair considering my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at 55/45?  We can both walk away with something good. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer carefully. She's offering me $4,500 now, which is better than her initial offer of $4,000. With 19% inflation since round 1, this $4,500 is worth about $3,645 in round 1 terms for me.

If I reject and we continue negotiating, the inflation will further reduce the value of any future agreement for me. Alice seems willing to compromise, moving from 60/40 to 55/45. This is a reasonable improvement, and continuing to negotiate might result in diminishing returns due to inflation.
