"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my first offer, considering the declining value of the money for Bob:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

My reasoning: I'm offering more than half, hoping Bob will accept it considering the rapid decline in the value of the money for him. It's a relatively generous first offer, aiming for a quick agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob's offer is a 50/50 split. Given that the value of the money is decreasing for Bob and not for me, and we only have 12 rounds, I will accept this offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
