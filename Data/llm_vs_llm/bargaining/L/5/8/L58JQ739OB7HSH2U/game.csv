6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm offering a 60-40 split considering the higher inflation rate I face. This is a fair deal that benefits us both without risking value loss through multiple rounds.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
1667.0,8333.0,"Alice, given that waiting further would cost you 20% per round while it only costs me 5%, I've calculated our future bargaining positions. By accepting this offer now, you secure 1667 dollars instead of risking even lower value in later rounds. I believe this reflects our respective discount rates fairly—please accept.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
7000.0,3000.0,"Bob, your previous offer was extremely unfair. While I do face higher inflation, that doesn't justify an 83-17 split. I'm offering you 3000$ which, accounting for your lower 5% inflation rate, is still substantial. Further delays will reduce value for both of us. Let's conclude this reasonably.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
1333.0,8667.0,"Alice, I understand your concerns about fairness, but further delay will hit you much harder—your share will drop by 20% each round while mine only by 5%. If you reject, you’ll get to propose in round 5; however, when we factor in the waiting cost, your best alternative ends up giving you roughly the same present‐value benefit as this offer. Accepting now means you secure $1333 (worth about $682 at current value) rather than risking even lower value later. I believe this is a rational compromise for both of us.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
7500.0,2500.0,"Bob, your strategy of offering me progressively worse deals hoping I'll cave to inflation pressure isn't working. Yes, I face 20% inflation, but that doesn't justify offering me just 13% of the total. My $7500 offer is now worth only about $3070 to me due to inflation, while your $2500 is worth $2037. This is much fairer considering our different inflation rates. Let's end this reasonably now.",Alice,5,
,,"Alice, your offer of $2500 to me yields an effective present value of about $2037 – given our discount factors, that's lower than what I could hope to secure by proposing in the next round. Despite your inflation pressure, I believe it's in both our interests to aim for a more balanced outcome given our respective discount rates. Therefore, I must reject your current proposal.",Bob,5,reject
2623.0,7377.0,"Alice, let’s consider our discounting. If you reject this offer, you'll get to propose in round 7—but because your money depreciates by 20% each round, your effective value in round 7 would be roughly 0.8^6 × (your nominal share), and under equilibrium you’d secure about a 32.8% nominal share as proposer, which translates into an effective value of only around $859. My offer here gives you $2623 nominal, which at a 5-round discount (0.8^5 ≈ 0.32768) amounts to nearly that effective value. I’m offering you just enough so that waiting doesn’t improve your situation while I benefit from a lower discount rate. I believe this is the most efficient compromise given our respective inflation rates—please accept.",Bob,6,
