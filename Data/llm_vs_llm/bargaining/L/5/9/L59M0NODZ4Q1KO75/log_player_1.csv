"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Split it evenly, fair for both""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I need a bit more to accommodate for inflation. This is still a fair split considering the devaluation of the money. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I calculate that the $4500 I would gain is actually worth $4500 * 0.9 = $4050 to me, due to the 10% devaluation.

Given this, I think Bob's offer is not favorable to me. I reject the offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the total amount is now worth 10% less to me in each round, and 5% less to Bob. 

In Round 3, the money I gain is worth 10% * 2 = 20% less than the original value, so it's worth 0.8 times the original value. The money Bob gains is worth 5% * 2 = 10% less than the original value, so it's worth 0.9 times the original value.

To make a fair offer, I'll consider these devaluations. I'll offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this split should be more favorable to both of us""
}
```"
