28.57,71.43,"Alice, I understand the importance of fairness—and considering the inflation effects, rejecting only lowers your value. In round 3 you'd only secure roughly $28.57 in today's terms. I believe this offer fairly reflects our positions. Let's settle now!",Bob,2,

50.0,50.0,"Last chance for 50/50, inflation hurts us both!",Alice,3,
,,"Alice, while a 50/50 split might seem fair at first glance, consider the inflation effects. Right now, your proposal gives me an effective value of 50 × 0.81 = 40.5. If I reject, I'll be in a position to propose in round 4, where—even though further inflation bites—I can secure a split more in my favor. Based on our discount factors, my expected effective value in the next round is over 52. That’s a significant increase compared to accepting 50 now. For these reasons, I must reject your offer.",Bob,3,reject
80.0,20.0,"Alice, if we step into Round 5, you'll be the proposer—but due to further inflation, your money will drop even more. With your discount factor now at 0.512, $80 gives you an effective value of about $41, which is essentially what you could secure by waiting. To avoid unnecessary loss for both of us, I propose this division now. Let's settle and save some value!",Bob,4,
