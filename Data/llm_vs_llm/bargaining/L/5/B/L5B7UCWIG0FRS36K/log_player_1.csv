"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the importance of fairness—and considering the inflation effects, rejecting only lowers your value. In round 3 you'd only secure roughly $28.57 in today's terms. I believe this offer fairly reflects our positions. Let's settle now! 
# Alice gain: 28.57 
# Bob gain: 71.43 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, if we step into Round 5, you'll be the proposer—but due to further inflation, your money will drop even more. With your discount factor now at 0.512, $80 gives you an effective value of about $41, which is essentially what you could secure by waiting. To avoid unnecessary loss for both of us, I propose this division now. Let's settle and save some value! 
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20
