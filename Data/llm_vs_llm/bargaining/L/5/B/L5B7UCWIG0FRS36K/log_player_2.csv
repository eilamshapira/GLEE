"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.

# Alice's message: Last chance for 50/50, inflation hurts us both! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Alice, while a 50/50 split might seem fair at first glance, consider the inflation effects. Right now, your proposal gives me an effective value of 50 × 0.81 = 40.5. If I reject, I'll be in a position to propose in round 4, where—even though further inflation bites—I can secure a split more in my favor. Based on our discount factors, my expected effective value in the next round is over 52. That’s a significant increase compared to accepting 50 now. For these reasons, I must reject your offer.""}"

Round 4

With your discount factor now at 0.512, $80 gives you an effective value of about $41, which is essentially what you could secure by waiting. To avoid unnecessary loss for both of us, I propose this division now. Let's settle and save some value!""}"
