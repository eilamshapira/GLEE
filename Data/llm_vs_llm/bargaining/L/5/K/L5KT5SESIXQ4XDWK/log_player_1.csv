"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and you get $45. This is a reasonable split that gives both of us a substantial portion, and accepting now helps us both avoid inflation losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
- If I accept now, I'll get $50 but it's worth 5% less, so effectively $47.50
- If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount will be worth even less (10% less than original)
- Bob is offering an equal split, which is fair
- Even though Bob's money is worth less to him (20% less), he's still willing to split equally
- If I reject, there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal next round given inflation

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept the offer. Getting $47.50 in effective value now is better than risking further devaluation in the next round."
