"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a somewhat fair split, but slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer and there's inflation risk for me.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. This is a reasonable split that gives both of us a substantial amount while being close to 50-50."
