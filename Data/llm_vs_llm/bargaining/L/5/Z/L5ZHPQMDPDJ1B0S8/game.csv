900000.0,100000.0,"I propose a fair division, taking into account the potential for inflation.  Let's get this done quickly!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,Your 10% inflation rate puts you at a disadvantage in later rounds. This is a fair offer considering our different inflation rates. Let's make a deal now while the money holds more value for both of us.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
700000.0,300000.0,I understand your perspective on inflation. Let's find a compromise that benefits us both.  This offer takes into account the deflationary pressure we're both facing.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"I've moved from my previous position to meet you in the middle. At this point, your $450000 at 72% value gives you $324000 real value, while my $550000 at 85.5% gives me $470250. This is actually quite balanced in real terms. Further delays will hurt both of us, but you more significantly. Let's conclude this now.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
600000.0,400000.0,I am willing to compromise further.  This offer is a more balanced split than your last one.  Let's end this quickly and minimize the effects of inflation.,Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
475000.0,525000.0,"Let's be practical about the real values here. Your $475000 at 59% value is worth $280250, while my $525000 at 77.4% is worth $406350. This is much closer to fair than it appears at face value, given our different inflation rates. You've shown willingness to compromise, and I have too. Further delays will severely hurt both of us - you've already lost 41% of value, while I've lost 23%. This is our best chance for a mutually beneficial outcome.",Bob,6,
