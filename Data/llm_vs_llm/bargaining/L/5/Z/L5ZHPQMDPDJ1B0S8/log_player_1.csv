Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your 10% inflation rate puts you at a disadvantage in later rounds. This is a fair offer considering our different inflation rates. Let's make a deal now while the money holds more value for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've moved from my previous position to meet you in the middle. At this point, your $450000 at 72% value gives you $324000 real value, while my $550000 at 85.5% gives me $470250. This is actually quite balanced in real terms. Further delays will hurt both of us, but you more significantly. Let's conclude this now. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be practical about the real values here. Your $475000 at 59% value is worth $280250, while my $525000 at 77.4% is worth $406350. This is much closer to fair than it appears at face value, given our different inflation rates. You've shown willingness to compromise, and I have too. Further delays will severely hurt both of us - you've already lost 41% of value, while I've lost 23%. This is our best chance for a mutually beneficial outcome. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000
