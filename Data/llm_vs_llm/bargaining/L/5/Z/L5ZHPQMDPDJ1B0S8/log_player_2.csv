"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair division, taking into account the potential for inflation.  Let's get this done quickly! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $100,000 and keeping $900,000
2. This is only a 10/90 split, which is quite unfair
3. If I reject:
   - Next round I can make a proposal
   - Money will be worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Alice
   - Alice's position weakens more quickly than mine due to higher inflation
4. Given that Alice faces higher inflation (10% vs my 5%), I have leverage to negotiate a better deal

This offer is too low - I should reject and propose a more equitable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a strategic offer:

1. Since we're in round 2:
   - My money is worth 95% of original value
   - Alice's money is worth 90% of original value
2. Alice is more pressured by inflation than I am
3. However, I should still be reasonable to encourage acceptance

I'll propose a more balanced split, but tilted in my favor given my stronger position.

""message"": ""Your 10% inflation rate puts you at a disadvantage in later rounds. This is a fair offer considering our different inflation rates. Let's make a deal now while the money holds more value for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your perspective on inflation. Let's find a compromise that benefits us both.  This offer takes into account the deflationary pressure we're both facing. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Current situation:
   - I'm offered $300,000 (worth 90.25% of original value)
   - Real value for me: $270,750
   - Alice keeps $700,000 (worth 81% of original value)
   - Real value for Alice: $567,000

2. If I reject:
   - Next round my money will be worth ~85.5% of original
   - Alice's money will be worth ~72% of original
   - I can make another proposal
   - We still have 9 rounds left

3. Assessment:
   - This is a 30/70 split, better than the initial 10/90
   - However, given Alice's higher inflation rate, I still have leverage
   - The split should be more favorable to me given our inflation differences

I believe I can get a better deal, and Alice's position weakens faster than mine.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me strategize for round 4:

1. Current inflation impact:
   - My money is worth ~85.5% of original value
   - Alice's money is worth ~72% of original value
   - The gap is widening in my favor

2. Strategy:
   - Need to propose something Alice might accept to avoid further value loss
   - But maintain advantage from inflation differential
   - Show willingness to compromise from my previous 60/40 split

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I've moved from my previous position to meet you in the middle. At this point, your $450,000 at 72% value gives you $324,000 real value, while my $550,000 at 85.5% gives me $470,250. This is actually quite balanced in real terms. Further delays will hurt both of us, but you more significantly. Let's conclude this now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I am willing to compromise further.  This offer is a more balanced split than your last one.  Let's end this quickly and minimize the effects of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Current values:
   - I'm offered $400,000 (worth 81.45% of original value)
   - Real value for me: $325,800
   - Alice keeps $600,000 (worth 65.61% of original value)
   - Real value for Alice: $393,660

2. The situation:
   - This is a 40/60 split, better than previous offers
   - Alice has moved significantly from her initial 10/90 split
   - The inflation gap continues to widen in my favor
   - We still have 7 rounds left

3. Decision factors:
   - While this is a better offer, I still have leverage
   - Alice's money is devaluing faster (lost ~34% vs my ~19%)
   - Another round or two could push Alice toward a 50/50 split
   - The real value difference is still significant ($325,800 vs $393,660)

Given that Alice has shown willingness to move toward a more equal split and is feeling the pressure of higher inflation, I think I can get a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a strategic offer for round 6:

1. Current situation:
   - My money is worth ~77.4% of original value
   - Alice's money is worth ~59% of original value
   - Both of us have lost significant value
   - Alice's losses are accelerating faster

2. Strategy:
   - Need to propose something Alice will likely accept
   - Show I acknowledge her movement toward compromise
   - Make the real value calculation clear
   - Emphasize urgency due to mounting losses

{""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Let's be practical about the real values here. Your $475,000 at 59% value is worth $280,250, while my $525,000 at 77.4% is worth $406,350. This is much closer to fair than it appears at face value, given our different inflation rates. You've shown willingness to compromise, and I have too. Further delays will severely hurt both of us - you've already lost 41% of value, while I've lost 23%. This is our best chance for a mutually beneficial outcome.""}"
