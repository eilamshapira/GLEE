"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that slightly favors me as the first mover. If we drag this out too long, inflation will eat away at the value for me by 10% each round, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. This offer gives you a substantial sum while acknowledging my position as the initial proposer.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's go with an even split. This way, we both benefit equally and avoid the effects of inflation as quickly as possible. Fair for both of us, don't you think? 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
