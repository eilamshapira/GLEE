"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that slightly favors me as the first mover. If we drag this out too long, inflation will eat away at the value for me by 10% each round, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. This offer gives you a substantial sum while acknowledging my position as the initial proposer. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
