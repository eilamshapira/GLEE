Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob.  Let's get closer to a fair split.  I'm willing to give you a little more, but I'm not going to go much lower than this. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100

Alice is still trying to take advantage, even with a minor concession. I need to show her I'm serious about getting a fair deal, considering the inflation working against me."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing money with each round.  Let's just split it evenly and move on. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

While not ideal, the effects of inflation are starting to become significant. Accepting a 50/50 split now is better than risking an even worse outcome later."
