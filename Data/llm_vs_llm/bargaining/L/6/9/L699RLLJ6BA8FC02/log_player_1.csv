"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a division that takes into account the 20% depreciation per round for Bob while being fair enough to potentially get accepted.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose giving myself $6,000 and Bob $4,000. This is a reasonable split considering that if Bob rejects, his next round's money will be worth 20% less to him. By accepting now, he gets a solid $4,000 at full value rather than risking depreciation."
