"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully, taking into account the 20% inflation penalty I face in each round.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value will be worth 20% less to me (only $8,000 effective value). Even if I could get more in absolute terms, I need to factor in this depreciation.

The current offer gives me $4,000. If I reject, I'd need to secure more than $5,000 in the next round just to break even (since $5,000 after 20% depreciation would be worth $4,000 to me).

Given the significant inflation penalty I face and the reasonable split Alice is offering, I'll accept.
