"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split, let's end this! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice is offering me $400,000 while taking $600,000
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 20% less next round
3. Next round I could propose, but Alice might reject
4. $400,000 now is better than $500,000 next round (which would be worth $400,000 due to inflation)
5. There's risk in rejection as we only have 12 rounds

The offer isn't perfectly fair, but considering the inflation penalty and the risk of prolonged negotiation, it's reasonable.
