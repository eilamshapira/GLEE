"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my first offer to Bob. Since this is the first round, I want to be fair, but also recognize that inflation affects me more with each passing round.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose we split the money equally - $5,000 for each of us. This is a fair division that benefits us both equally."
