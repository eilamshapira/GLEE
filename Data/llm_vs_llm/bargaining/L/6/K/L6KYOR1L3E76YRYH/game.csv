5800.0,4200.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a slightly favorable split for myself because inflation hurts me less than you. If we go to the next round, your money will be worth 20% less, while mine only 10% less. This is fair considering our different inflation rates.",Alice,1,

5000.0,5000.0,"Let's split it evenly.  We both lose value with each round, and this way we can both maximize our potential gains.",Bob,2,

5700.0,4300.0,"Bob, I'm offering you a better deal than before. If you reject, we'll go to round 4 where your share will be worth 40% less than the original value, while mine will only be 30% less. This offer is actually giving you more value than an even split would in the next round due to our different inflation rates. Let's agree now rather than losing more value to inflation.",Alice,3,
