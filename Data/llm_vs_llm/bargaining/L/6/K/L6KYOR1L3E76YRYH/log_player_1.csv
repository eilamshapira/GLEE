"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a fair offer to Bob considering the inflation rates.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a slightly favorable split for myself because inflation hurts me less than you. If we go to the next round, your money will be worth 20% less, while mine only 10% less. This is fair considering our different inflation rates.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  We both lose value with each round, and this way we can both maximize our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5700,
  ""bob_gain"": 4300,
  ""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you a better deal than before. If you reject, we'll go to round 4 where your share will be worth 40% less than the original value, while mine will only be 30% less. This offer is actually giving you more value than an even split would in the next round due to our different inflation rates. Let's agree now rather than losing more value to inflation.""
