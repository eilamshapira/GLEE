"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a slightly favorable split for myself because inflation hurts me less than you. If we go to the next round, your money will be worth 20% less, while mine only 10% less. This is fair considering our different inflation rates. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly.  We both lose value with each round, and this way we can both maximize our potential gains.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a better deal than before. If you reject, we'll go to round 4 where your share will be worth 40% less than the original value, while mine will only be 30% less. This offer is actually giving you more value than an even split would in the next round due to our different inflation rates. Let's agree now rather than losing more value to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
