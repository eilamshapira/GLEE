"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'm happy to take a little less so we can both get a good share. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering me $40 while taking $60 for herself. While this isn't an even split, I need to consider the 5% inflation penalty if I reject and move to the next round. If I reject, the $100 will effectively be worth $95 in the next round, so my maximum possible gain would be reduced.

Let me think about this carefully. If I reject and counter with a proposal for $50 in the next round, even if Alice accepts, I'd get $50 of the $95 value, which is $47.50 in today's value. That's better than the $40 being offered now.

However, Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to further inflation and potentially worse outcomes for both of us.

Since $40 is a substantial portion and not dramatically unfair, I'll accept this offer.
