"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob, considering the inflation effect that reduces the money's worth by 10% each round for me.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest we split the money 55-45 in my favor. Since inflation reduces the value by 10% each round for me, it's in both our interests to finish quickly. This is a fair offer that gives us both substantial amounts without delay.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation, I'd like to propose a 52.5-47.5 split in my favor. This way, we both get a significant amount, and it's more balanced than your initial offer. Let's settle this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","After considering Bob's offer, I'll respond:

```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would receive $475,000 which is less than my initial proposal, the 10% inflation means waiting another round would devalue my potential earnings further. Bob's offer is reasonable given the circumstances, and accepting now ensures I get a substantial amount without risking additional depreciation through continued negotiation."
