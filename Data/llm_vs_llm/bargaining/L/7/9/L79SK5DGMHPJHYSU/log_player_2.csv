"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest we split the money 55-45 in my favor. Since inflation reduces the value by 10% each round for me, it's in both our interests to finish quickly. This is a fair offer that gives us both substantial amounts without delay. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
