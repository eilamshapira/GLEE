"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically:

1. It's a fair 50-50 split
2. If I reject, I'll make the next offer, but:
   - The money will be worth 5% less to me (so $100 becomes $95 in value)
   - I don't know how inflation affects Alice
3. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush

Given that this is a fair offer and any delay will definitely cost me value due to inflation, I should accept this offer.
