"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer of a 50-50 split. While equal division seems fair, I need to account for the 5% inflation penalty for each round. If I reject, I'll make a counter-offer next round, but the total value will be worth less to me.

Given that this is the first round with no inflation yet, and a 50-50 split is generally considered fair, I'll accept this offer.
