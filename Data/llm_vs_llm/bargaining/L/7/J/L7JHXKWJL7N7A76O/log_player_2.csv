"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I think this is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is suggesting I get $40 while she gets $60, which isn't an even split. Given that inflation reduces the value by 10% each round for me, I need to weigh the benefit of accepting now versus making a counter-offer.

If I reject and counter-offer in the next round, I'll potentially get a better nominal amount, but it will be worth 10% less to me.

While a 40/60 split isn't equal, it's reasonably fair, and the inflation penalty makes waiting costly for me.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more balanced while acknowledging the inflation pressure I face.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe an equal split would be fair. I'm proposing 50/50. I should mention that I face a 10% inflation penalty each round, which makes early agreement beneficial for me.""}"
