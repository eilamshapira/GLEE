55.0,45.0,"Alice, I appreciate your previous proposal. However, every extra round costs me a bit due to inflation. To settle things quickly and fairly, I propose a 45/55 split in your favor. This way you get a slightly larger share while I avoid further losses on my side. I hope you find this acceptable so we can close the deal swiftly.",Bob,2,
