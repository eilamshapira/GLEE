"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your previous proposal. However, every extra round costs me a bit due to inflation. To settle things quickly and fairly, I propose a 45/55 split in your favor. This way you get a slightly larger share while I avoid further losses on my side. I hope you find this acceptable so we can close the deal swiftly. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
