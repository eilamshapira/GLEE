Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your previous proposal. However, every extra round costs me a bit due to inflation. To settle things quickly and fairly, I propose a 45/55 split in your favor. This way you get a slightly larger share while I avoid further losses on my side. I hope you find this acceptable so we can close the deal swiftly.""}"
