"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split while considering that Bob's money loses 20% value each round. If he rejects, his next counteroffer will be worth less to him.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this 60-40 split because if Bob rejects, in the next round his money will be worth 20% less to him, so it's in his interest to accept this reasonable offer now rather than delay and lose value."
