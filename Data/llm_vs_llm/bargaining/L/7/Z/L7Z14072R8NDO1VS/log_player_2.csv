"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer:

If I accept now:
- I get $40
- Alice gets $60

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
- The money will be worth 5% less to me
- The money will be worth 10% less to Alice
- I have bargaining leverage since inflation affects Alice more

Since this is just the first round and Alice is facing higher inflation pressure than I am, I think I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more favorable to me while still being reasonable for Alice. Since Alice faces 10% inflation per round compared to my 5%, she has more incentive to reach an agreement sooner.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I suggest we split the money more evenly, with me getting $55 and you getting $45. This is a fair compromise that gives both of us a substantial portion while recognizing the time pressure we both face due to inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer:

If I accept now:
- I get $50 (worth about $45.13 compared to round 1 value due to 9.75% inflation)
- Alice gets $50 (worth about $40.50 compared to round 1 value due to 19% inflation)

If I reject:
- We go to round 4 where I can make another offer
- Inflation will continue to reduce the value for both of us
- Alice faces higher inflation pressure (10% per round vs my 5%)

Alice has moved considerably from her initial 40/60 split to an even 50/50 split. This is a fair offer, and considering the inflation effects, accepting now is better than continuing to negotiate while our potential gains diminish.
