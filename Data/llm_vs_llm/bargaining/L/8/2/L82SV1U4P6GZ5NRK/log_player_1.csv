Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm offering you $4500 which is better for you to accept now than waiting for the next round where inflation would reduce your buying power by 20%. This is a fair deal considering the inflation factor.

# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
