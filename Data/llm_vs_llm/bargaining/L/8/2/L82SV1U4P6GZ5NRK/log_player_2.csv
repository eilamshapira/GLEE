"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's offering me $4,000 out of the $10,000, which is 40% of the total, while she keeps 60% ($6,000).

Given that inflation doesn't affect me (0% devaluation per round) but affects Alice (20% devaluation per round), I have an advantage by continuing to the next round. If I reject, I'll get to make an offer in Round 2, and the money will still be worth the same to me, but will be worth 20% less to Alice.

Since I can make a better offer for myself in the next round, and Alice will have more incentive to accept due to inflation affecting her, I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a strategic offer that accounts for the inflation Alice faces. Since the money will be worth 20% less to Alice in the next round, she has an incentive to accept a more balanced offer now.

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm offering you $4,500 which is better for you to accept now than waiting for the next round where inflation would reduce your buying power by 20%. This is a fair deal considering the inflation factor.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a generous offer 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's latest offer in the context of our situation.

Alice is now offering me $4,200 (slightly more than her first offer of $4,000) and keeping $5,800 for herself. 

Key considerations:
- I'm not affected by inflation, so $4,200 has the same value to me as it did in round 1
- Alice is now experiencing 36% inflation, so her $5,800 is effectively worth only $3,712 in round 1 value
- If I reject, I can make another offer in round 4, but Alice will face even more inflation (about 49% from the original value)
- I could potentially get a better deal in the next round

However, Alice has increased her offer to me, which shows she's considering the inflation effects. While I could potentially get more by rejecting and making my own offer, there's also a risk of prolonging negotiations when I already have a reasonable offer.

Given that Alice has improved her offer and we're already in round 3, I'll accept this offer.
