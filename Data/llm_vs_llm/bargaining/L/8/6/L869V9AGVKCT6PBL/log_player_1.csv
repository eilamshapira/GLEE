Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000

{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, I'm willing to bet Bob is more sensitive to inflation than he's letting on.  I'll hold out for a better deal, knowing that the longer the game goes on, the more desperate he might become."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
``` 

I'm slightly lowering my demand but staying firm. It signals I'm willing to negotiate but won't settle for an even split.  This offer still strongly favors me, and the clock is ticking for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is clearly feeling the pressure from inflation, but this offer is still not favorable enough for me.  He's moving in the right direction, though. I need to hold firm and see if I can push him further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

This offer shows I'm willing to negotiate down, but I'm still aiming for a significant share. With the inflation working against him, Bob might be more inclined to accept a less favorable deal sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 750000 
# Bob gain: 250000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a reasonable deal considering the circumstances. I'm getting a very favorable split, and waiting any longer carries the risk of Bob offering even less or time running out."
