"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I'm Alice, I need to make a proposal to Bob, and there's inflation eating away at the value of the money for me each round. I want to maximize my gains within the 12-round limit.

Here's my initial offer, trying to balance a reasonable gain for myself with the need to get Bob to accept to avoid inflation eating into my potential winnings. I'll offer Bob a slight majority to encourage acceptance.
