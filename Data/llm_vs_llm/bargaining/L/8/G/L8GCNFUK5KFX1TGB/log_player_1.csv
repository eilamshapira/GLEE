"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a reasonable first offer that gives Bob a substantial portion while recognizing my position as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Bob's offer would give me $4500
2. Due to 20% inflation, this $4500 is actually worth $3600 to me
3. If I reject and we go to round 3, any amount I get will be worth another 20% less
4. Rejecting could lead to even worse offers or risk losing everything
5. $3600 in real value is better than risking further devaluation
