"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's make a fair split considering the different inflation rates we face. I propose a 60-40 split in my favor to account for my higher inflation penalty of 20% versus your 10%.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is fairer, considering the difference in our inflation rates.  Let's try to find a solution we can both agree on! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept, I get $4500, but with 20% inflation, it's worth $3600 to me
2. If I reject and we continue, future rounds will have even higher inflation
3. Bob's offer is reasonable given the inflation difference
4. Getting something now is better than risking further rounds with more inflation
