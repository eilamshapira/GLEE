"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make the first proposal to divide the $1,000,000. Given that Bob and I need to agree on a fair division and considering the 10% inflation effect on my side per round, I'll propose a somewhat favorable split for myself in this first round.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I believe this is a reasonable first offer that gives me a slight advantage while still offering Bob a substantial share. If Bob rejects, I'll face inflation in the next round, so I'm trying to secure a good position now while being fair enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept this offer. While it's a 50-50 split, the 10% inflation means if I reject and try to get more in the next round, the money will be worth even less to me. This is a fair split and prevents further depreciation of my share due to inflation."
