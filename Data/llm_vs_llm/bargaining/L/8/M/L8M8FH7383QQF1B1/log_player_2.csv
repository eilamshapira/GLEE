"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. I'm being offered $4,000 out of $10,000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, the money will be worth less next round
4. $4,000 now is better than $4,200 next round due to inflation

While 40% of the total isn't the most favorable split, considering the inflation penalty and the uncertainty of future negotiations, this is a reasonable offer. If I reject, I'd need to secure significantly more in the next round to offset the 5% inflation loss.
