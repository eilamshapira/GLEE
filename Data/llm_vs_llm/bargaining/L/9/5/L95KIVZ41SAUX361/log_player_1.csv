"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair first offer, considering that future rounds will reduce the value due to inflation for me.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split where I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. This is a reasonable first offer that gives me a slight advantage while still being fair enough that Bob might accept it rather than risk the next round where inflation will affect the total value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5250 
# Bob gain: 4750 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept, I'll get $5250, but with 10% inflation, it's worth $4725 to me
- If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount will be worth 20% less to me
- Bob's inflation rate is lower (5%), making their $4750 worth $4512.50 to them

Given that the value will decrease significantly more for me in the next round, and this is actually a fairly reasonable offer (even after accounting for inflation), I should accept.
