"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me in each round, I'll try to make a fair offer. Considering the initial amount is $10,000, after one round, it's worth $9,500 for me (due to 5% inflation).

My offer:
{""bob_gain"": 4750, 
""alice_gain"": 5250}"
