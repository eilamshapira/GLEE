"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

1. Current offer is a 50-50 split: $500,000 for each
2. If I reject and go to next round:
   * I can make a counter-offer
   * But the money will be worth 10% less to me
   * $500,000 now > $450,000 next round (after 10% inflation)
   * I don't know how inflation affects Alice's valuation

This is actually a fair initial offer, and with the certainty of inflation affecting my gains in future rounds, accepting now would be the rational choice. Even if I could potentially negotiate for more in the next round, the 10% loss in value would likely offset any gains.
