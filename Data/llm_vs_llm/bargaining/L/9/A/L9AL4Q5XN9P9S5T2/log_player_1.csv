"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let me propose a fair split to start the negotiations, but slightly in my favor since Bob has the power to accept/reject.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. A fairly balanced split that gives both of us a good portion, while giving me a small advantage since I'm making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

The offer gives me $48, but due to 20% inflation, it's actually worth $38.4 to me.
For Bob, his $52 is only reduced by 5%, so it's worth $49.4 to him.

While this split isn't great for me, if I reject and we continue to later rounds, my inflation penalty will keep growing (20% more each round), while Bob's penalty seems smaller. This means my negotiating position will get worse over time.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer since waiting for future rounds will likely result in even less real value for me due to the asymmetric inflation effects."
