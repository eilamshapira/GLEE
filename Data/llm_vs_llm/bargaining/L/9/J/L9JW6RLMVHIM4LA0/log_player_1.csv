"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair initial offer, considering that any delay will cost me 20% due to inflation. A 60-40 split in my favor seems reasonable as a starting point.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. This is a fair offer considering the inflation risk I face in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 20% inflation for me, if I accept Bob's offer now:
* I would get $5,500, but it's worth only $4,400 (5500 * 0.8) to me due to inflation
* Bob would get $4,500 at full value

If I reject, any future gains will be worth even less to me due to compounding inflation. While I could try to negotiate for more, the risk of further devaluation is significant. Bob's offer is reasonable given my weakened position due to inflation.
