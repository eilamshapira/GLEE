"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically. Alice is offering me 4000$ out of 10,000$, which is 40% of the total amount. While this isn't exactly an even split, it's a reasonable first offer. 

However, since I don't face any inflation penalty and have plenty of rounds left, I can try to negotiate for a better deal. By rejecting this offer, I can make my own proposal in the next round, potentially for a more favorable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I rejected Alice's 40-60 split, I'll propose a more balanced division, but still giving Alice a slight advantage to increase the chances of acceptance. I'll aim for a 45-55 split, which is more equitable while still being generous enough to potentially secure an agreement.
