Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: Alice, let's split the money fairly. I'm offering a 55/45 split in your favor, considering the inflation. If you accept, we can both get a good amount of money without risking further devaluation.

# Bob gain: 475000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that the inflation is affecting me more severely, but I still believe we can find a fair split. I'm offering $450000 for myself and $550000 for you. This is a compromise, considering the changing value of the money. If you accept, we can both get a significant amount without risking further devaluation.

# Bob gain: 450000

This offer is better than what I could likely secure in the next round considering the inflation rate.  While I was aiming for $600,000 initially, getting $550,000 now is better than risking further devaluation."
