"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll play as Alice in this negotiation game with Bob. I should aim for a fair division while considering the 10% inflation penalty per round that affects my gains.

For the first round, I'll offer a balanced split that slightly favors me:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing this split because while an equal division might seem fair, the inflation penalty means I need to secure a reasonable amount now. If Bob rejects and we go to round 2, my money will be worth 10% less, so I have an incentive to reach an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
