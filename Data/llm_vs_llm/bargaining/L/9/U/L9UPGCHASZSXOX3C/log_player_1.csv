"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for the initial round:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

My reasoning: I'm starting with a slight advantage for myself, acknowledging the fact that I'm making the first offer. However, I'm also making sure Bob gets a substantial amount to incentivize him to accept, avoiding the risk of further devaluation due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
