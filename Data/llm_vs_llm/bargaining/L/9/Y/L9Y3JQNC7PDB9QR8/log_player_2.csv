"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split this fairly - I propose 60/40 in my favor since you lose more value in later rounds due to higher inflation rate. This way we both benefit from concluding early. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Current offer: $40 for me, $60 for Alice
2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make an offer
   * But my money will be worth 20% less
   * Her money will be worth 10% less
   * $40 now is better than $50 worth 20% less ($40) later

Alice's reasoning is actually sound. Since my inflation rate (20%) is higher than hers (10%), I lose more by prolonging the game. Even if I counter-offer with a better split next round, the depreciation would likely negate any gains.
