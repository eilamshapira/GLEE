"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, slightly in my favor, to make up for the potential future loss of value. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 5% inflation, if I accept Bob's offer now:
* I would get $45, but it's worth 5% less, so effectively $42.75
* Bob would get $55 at full value

If I reject and make another offer next round:
* Any amount I get will be worth 10% less due to inflation
* I'd need to get significantly more than $45 to make up for the additional 5% loss

Given that:
1. Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate
2. The difference between this offer and my previous one isn't huge
3. Continuing to negotiate will cost me another 5% in value
4. There's no guarantee Bob will accept a better offer from me
