"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to make a strategic offer to Bob. Since money is worth 5% less each round for Bob, he has an incentive to accept earlier rather than later. However, I still want to be fair enough that he accepts my offer.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering a slightly higher amount for myself but still giving Bob a substantial portion. This is a fair offer that recognizes we both deserve a significant share, and it's better for Bob to accept now than to wait for future rounds when his money would be worth less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
