"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate this offer carefully.

Alice has proposed an even 50-50 split, with each of us receiving $50. This is a completely fair division that gives us equal shares.

Given that:
1. We're only in round 1
2. The money doesn't lose value for me over time (0% inflation for me)
3. A 50-50 split is generally considered fair
4. There's a risk of getting nothing if we reach round 12 without agreement

I see no reason to reject this perfectly fair offer.
