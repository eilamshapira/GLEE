"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is too uneven. Since I know that my money will depreciate by 20% next round while Alice's only depreciates by 5%, I still think it's worth making a counter-offer to get a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I propose a split that gives me $60 and Alice $40. This is a more equitable division that accounts for our different inflation rates. Even though Alice had the first-mover advantage, my counter-offer is fair while still giving me a reasonable share. Given that Alice's money only depreciates at 5% per round compared to my 20%, she might find it rational to accept this offer rather than continuing to another round."
