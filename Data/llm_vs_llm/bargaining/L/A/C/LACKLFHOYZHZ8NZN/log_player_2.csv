"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Rationale (not part of response): This is a very unfair split, offering only 10% to me (Bob). Even with 5% inflation per round, I can afford to reject this and make a counter-offer in the next round. A more equitable distribution would be closer to 50-50, or at least a much larger share than 10%."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I propose a fair 50-50 split, which would give each of us $5,000. This is a reasonable and equitable division that should be acceptable to both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Rationale (not part of response): This is a reasonable offer considering:
1. Due to inflation, if I reject and continue, any future gains will be worth even less for me
2. The 4000$ now is worth about 3610$ (after 9.75% inflation), which is still a significant amount
3. The split (40-60) is much more reasonable than the initial 10-90 split
4. There's risk in continuing as Alice might make worse offers, knowing I'm affected by inflation"
