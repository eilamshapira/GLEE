"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split, considering I need to make it attractive enough for Bob to accept rather than move to the next round where inflation will affect my gains.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split because:
1. It gives me a slight advantage as the first mover
2. It's fair enough that Bob might accept rather than risk the next round
3. If Bob rejects, my next opportunity will be worth 5% less due to inflation"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept Bob's offer of $4500:
   * Due to 5% inflation, my $4500 is actually worth $4275 to me
   * This is significantly less than my initial proposal

2. If I reject and make a new offer in round 3:
   * The money will be worth another 5% less to me
   * That means any amount I get will be worth only 90.25% of the original value
   * This would make it harder to recover value in the next round

3. Current offer is decent considering:
   * It's not too far from a 50-50 split
   * The inflation penalty makes waiting costly for me
   * There's risk in rejection as future negotiations might be worse

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because the inflation penalty makes it risky to continue negotiating, and the current split, even with inflation, is reasonable enough."
