"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me consider Alice's offer carefully.

She's proposing that I get $4,500 and she gets $5,500 out of the $10,000.

This gives me 45% of the total amount. While this isn't a 50-50 split, it's reasonably close. Since there's no inflation for me between rounds, I don't lose value by rejecting and making a counter-offer. However, I could potentially get a better deal if I make a counter-proposal.

I'll reject this offer to see if I can secure a more favorable division.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split that's slightly in my favor, since I now have the opportunity to make an offer.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I propose a 55%-45% split in my favor. This is the mirror image of what Alice offered me, and represents a fair counter-proposal that gives me a moderate advantage while still being reasonable enough that Alice might accept it rather than continuing to another round."
