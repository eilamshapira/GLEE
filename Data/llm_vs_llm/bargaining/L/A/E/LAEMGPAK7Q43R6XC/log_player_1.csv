"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a fair offer to Bob considering the game's inflation effect on my earnings.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Since I face 10% inflation with each round, delaying will reduce the value of my share. If we both aim to maximize our gains, accepting this offer is mutually beneficial rather than extending the game.""
