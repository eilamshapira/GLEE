"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
* She's offering me $45 and keeping $55
* This is slightly in her favor (55/45 split)
* If I reject, we move to round 2 with 5% inflation, so the total drops to $95
* I could counter-offer, but we risk losing more value to inflation
* 45% of $100 ($45) is better than 50% of $95 ($47.50)
* This is a reasonable first offer, close to 50-50
