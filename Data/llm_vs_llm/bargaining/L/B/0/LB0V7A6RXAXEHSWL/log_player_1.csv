Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's stop wasting time and split this evenly. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both walk away with a significant sum. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000

Taking the deal now makes sense. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** Bob is losing value in his potential gains faster than I am. This round's offer, while equal on paper, nets him significantly less than it would have in Round 1.
* **Time Pressure:** We're approaching the halfway point.  Holding out for a significantly better deal for myself is risky, and we both lose everything if we don't reach an agreement. 
* **Certainty:** A 50/50 split guarantees a good sum of money. It's better to secure that now than gamble on a slightly better outcome later and risk getting nothing."
