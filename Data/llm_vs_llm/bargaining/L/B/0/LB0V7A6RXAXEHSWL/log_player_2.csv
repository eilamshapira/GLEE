"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer gives us both a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the offer seems decent at first glance, I need to consider the impact of inflation and the potential for a better deal in later rounds. Accepting now means missing out on potential gains if Alice is highly motivated to avoid reaching round 12."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's split things a bit more fairly, Alice. This ensures we both benefit significantly.""} 

**Reasoning:** I'm offering a slightly more favorable split for me in Round 2, acknowledging the time pressure from inflation. My offer still gives Alice a sizable portion, encouraging her to accept rather than risk further devaluation of the money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm aiming for a fair deal. This offer reflects that, especially given the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is trying to capitalize on the inflation pressure, offering me slightly less than I offered her in the previous round (after accounting for the 36% devaluation). Accepting this offer would set a bad precedent and likely lead to progressively worse offers from her in future rounds. It's a risk, but I believe holding out for a better deal is still the optimal strategy."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time and split this evenly. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both walk away with a significant sum.""}

**Reasoning:**  I'm proposing a 50/50 split in Round 4. This emphasizes fairness and sends a clear message that I'm serious about reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. The time pressure from inflation is mounting, and a clean split offers a simple solution."
