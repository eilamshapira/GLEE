900000.0,100000.0,"Let's start fair. I take the majority, but you get something to start with.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
500000.0,500000.0,I believe a 50-50 split is the fairest solution for both of us. This way we both walk away with a significant amount.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
800000.0,200000.0,"I understand your desire for fairness, but I'm still the one taking the risk of rejection. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. ",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Since you're affected by inflation and I'm not, I understand you want to conclude this quickly. This 60-40 split gives you a substantial amount now before inflation reduces its value further.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
700000.0,300000.0,"This is getting ridiculous.  Let's stop with the 50/50 fantasies.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get more than 40% at this point.  Let's try to finish this before we both lose everything.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"The inflation is significantly reducing the value of your money - your last offer of 700K is only worth 459K to you now. This 65-35 split gives you 350K now, which is worth more than a larger amount later. Let's conclude this before inflation erodes your value further.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"We are getting closer! I'm willing to accept less than 700k to finish this before it's too late.  You're taking a bigger risk by letting the rounds go on, so this is a good deal for both of us.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"With inflation at nearly 47%, your 600K from last round is only worth 319K to you. This offer of 300K now is worth more to you than a larger amount in future rounds. Let's conclude this deal now - any further delay will only decrease your real value significantly.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
500000.0,500000.0,This is our last chance. We're both losing a lot of money with each passing round. Let's be reasonable and split it evenly. We can both walk away with a decent sum.,Alice,9,
