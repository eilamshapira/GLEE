"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take the majority, but you get something to start with. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice's offer gives me $100,000 while she takes $900,000, which is quite uneven (10%-90% split). Since there's no inflation affecting my value and we have 11 more rounds available, I can afford to negotiate for a better deal.

I should reject this and make a counter-offer in the next round. If Alice is concerned about inflation on her end, she might become more willing to accept a fairer split as rounds progress.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while being diplomatic.

{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""I believe a 50-50 split is the fairest solution for both of us. This way we both walk away with a significant amount.""
}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire for fairness, but I'm still the one taking the risk of rejection. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.  
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has increased my share from $100K to $200K, showing some willingness to negotiate
2. I now know Alice is affected by inflation (19% less value for her)
3. Her 800K is now worth only about 648K to her (due to 19% inflation)
4. I still have 9 rounds left, and my money maintains its value
5. Her increasing inflation suggests she might be more willing to give a better offer in future rounds

Since my money doesn't lose value and Alice's does, I have leverage to negotiate for a better split. The current offer is still quite uneven (20%-80% split), and I can likely get a better deal by waiting.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that Alice is affected by inflation while I'm not, I'll propose a split that's more favorable than 50-50 but not as extreme as her offers. This acknowledges both her time pressure and my stronger negotiating position.

{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Since you're affected by inflation and I'm not, I understand you want to conclude this quickly. This 60-40 split gives you a substantial amount now before inflation reduces its value further.""
}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is getting ridiculous.  Let's stop with the 50/50 fantasies.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get more than 40% at this point.  Let's try to finish this before we both lose everything. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze this situation:

1. Alice's 700K is now worth only about 459K to her (due to 34.39% inflation)
2. She's increased my offer to 300K, showing continued willingness to negotiate
3. The inflation rate is accelerating (from 19% to 34.39%)
4. We still have 7 rounds left
5. My money maintains its value

While Alice is offering more, I still have a strong negotiating position:
- Her money is rapidly losing value
- My money keeps its value
- There are several rounds left
- She seems increasingly anxious about the inflation

With these factors in mind, I can likely get a better deal by waiting. The current 30-70 split is still quite uneven, especially considering her money's decreasing value.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given the accelerating inflation affecting Alice and her apparent growing concern, I'll increase my pressure while still leaving room for negotiation.

{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""The inflation is significantly reducing the value of your money - your last offer of 700K is only worth 459K to you now. This 65-35 split gives you 350K now, which is worth more than a larger amount later. Let's conclude this before inflation erodes your value further.""
}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We are getting closer! I'm willing to accept less than 700k to finish this before it's too late.  You're taking a bigger risk by letting the rounds go on, so this is a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze:

1. Alice's 600K is now worth only about 319K to her (due to 46.86% inflation)
2. She's increased my offer to 400K, showing significant movement
3. Inflation has jumped dramatically (from 34.39% to 46.86%)
4. We have 5 rounds left
5. My money maintains its value

While Alice is making better offers and clearly wants to conclude, I still have advantages:
- Her money is losing value at an accelerating rate
- My position remains strong with no inflation
- Her message suggests increasing desperation
- Her 600K is worth less to her than my 400K is to me

Given these factors and the accelerating inflation rate, I believe I can get an even better deal by waiting. The current effective split (when accounting for her inflation) is becoming more balanced, but I can likely do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given the rapidly accelerating inflation (now at 46.86%) and Alice's increasing willingness to compromise, I'll push for an even stronger position while highlighting the urgency of reaching an agreement.

{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""With inflation at nearly 47%, your 600K from last round is only worth 319K to you. This offer of 300K now is worth more to you than a larger amount in future rounds. Let's conclude this deal now - any further delay will only decrease your real value significantly.""
}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is our last chance. We're both losing a lot of money with each passing round. Let's be reasonable and split it evenly. We can both walk away with a decent sum. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze this critical moment:

1. Alice's 500K is now worth only about 215K to her (due to 56.95% inflation)
2. She's now offering a 50-50 nominal split
3. Inflation has surged to 56.95%
4. Only 3 rounds remain
5. My money still maintains its value

While Alice is finally offering the 50-50 split I initially proposed, the situation has changed dramatically:
- Her 500K is worth less than half its nominal value to her
- The inflation rate is accelerating rapidly
- We're getting close to the final rounds
- She's showing signs of significant concern

However, this is also a risky moment:
- We only have 3 rounds left
- The risk of getting nothing is becoming real
- Alice might become more resistant if pushed too far

Given all these factors, especially the limited remaining rounds and the risk of getting nothing, I will accept this offer. While I might theoretically get a better deal by waiting, the risk-reward ratio has shifted towards accepting.
