"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I need to consider the actual value I'll get. 
20% of 40 is 8, so the value I'll get is 40 - 8 = 32.
Considering this, I don't think it's a fair offer.
{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less in each round, and this is the second reduction for me, I'll calculate the value I'll actually get:
20% of the initial amount is reduced twice: 
First reduction: 20% of 100 is 20, so 100 - 20 = 80
Second reduction: 20% of 80 is 16, so 80 - 16 = 64
To get a fair share, I should aim for a higher initial amount, considering the reduced value.
Let's propose:
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","To calculate the actual value I'll get, considering the 48.8% reduction:
48.8% of 35 is approximately 17.06, so the value I'll get is 35 - 17.06 = 17.94.
Given this significant reduction, I should consider accepting an offer that gives me a relatively higher value, even if it's not perfectly fair.
However, Bob's offer gives him 65, which is a large share.
I'll have to weigh the options and consider that the next round might bring an even lower value for me due to inflation.
