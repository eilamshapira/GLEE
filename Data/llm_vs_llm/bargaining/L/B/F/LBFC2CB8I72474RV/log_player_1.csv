"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, since you face 5% inflation per round and I don't, accepting this fair offer now is better than prolonging negotiations. I'm offering you $4500, which is much better than getting a depreciated amount later. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
