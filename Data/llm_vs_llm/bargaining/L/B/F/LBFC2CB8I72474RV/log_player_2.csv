"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I'm offering you 40% of the total amount right off the bat. It's a good deal considering the inflation! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:

1. She's offering me $4,000 out of $10,000 (40%)
2. While she keeps $6,000 (60%)
3. If I reject, in the next round:
   - I can make my own proposal
   - The money will be worth 5% less for Alice, but same for me
   - This gives me some negotiating leverage

This isn't a fair split, and since I won't lose value due to inflation but Alice will, I have a stronger position. I can make a better counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer, leveraging the fact that Alice faces inflation pressure:

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, since you face 5% inflation per round and I don't, accepting this fair offer now is better than prolonging negotiations. I'm offering you $4,500, which is much better than getting a depreciated amount later.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems you're underestimating how inflation affects things. This is my counter-offer. I'm willing to be generous, but I need you to meet me halfway. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze Alice's new offer:

1. She's offering me $4,500 (45%) and keeping $5,500 (55%)
2. This is better than her first offer of $4,000
3. For her, the $5,500 is actually worth less now due to 9.75% inflation
4. If I reject:
   - I can make another proposal next round
   - Alice's money will be worth even less (about 15% less than original)
   - My money maintains its value
   - But we're starting to reach diminishing returns

While I could push for more, this offer is reasonably fair, and continuing might lead to unnecessary value destruction. The improvement from her first offer shows good faith negotiation.
