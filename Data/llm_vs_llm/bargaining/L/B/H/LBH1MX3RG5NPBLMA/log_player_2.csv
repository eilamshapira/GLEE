"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000
2. This is a 40/60 split, which isn't quite fair
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
4. There's no inflation penalty for me, so I don't lose value by continuing
5. I can likely propose a more equitable split in the next round

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more equitable split, but still giving Alice a slight advantage to increase chances of acceptance:

{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200}

This is a fair 48/52 split which should be more acceptable than the previous 40/60 split while still giving Alice a small advantage. It's a reasonable compromise that respects both parties' interests."
