"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider inflation.

*   **My perspective (Alice):** The money is now worth 5% less. This means the $400,000 I'd get is now effectively worth 400,000 * 0.95 = $380,000 in terms of its original value.

Given the limited rounds left, I will accept this offer.
