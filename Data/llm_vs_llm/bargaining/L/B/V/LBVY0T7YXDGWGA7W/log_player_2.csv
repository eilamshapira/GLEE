"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly down the middle, Bob. 500000 for each of us. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to think about this carefully. Alice is offering a 50-50 split, which sounds fair on the surface, but I need to consider the inflation effect.

If I reject and we go to the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me. That means in the next round, the $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $800,000 from my perspective. Even if I were to get all of it (which is unlikely), I'd still be worse off than taking $500,000 now.
