"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice is offering me $4,000 of the $10,000
2. If I reject, we move to round 2 where I can make an offer
3. However, due to 20% inflation per round, my $4,000 in this round would be worth more than $4,000 in future rounds
4. In round 2, the money would be worth 20% less to me, so I'd need to get at least $5,000 to match the current $4,000 offer

Given that:
- The offer is relatively fair (40/60 split)
- Inflation will hurt my negotiating position in future rounds
- There's risk in continuing negotiations
- Alice has no inflation penalty, so she can afford to be patient
