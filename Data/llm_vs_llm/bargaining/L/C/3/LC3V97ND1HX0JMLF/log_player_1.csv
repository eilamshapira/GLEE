"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to make a strategic offer to Bob, considering that with each passing round, the money is worth 20% less to him due to inflation, while remaining stable for me. Bob will be rational and accept an offer if it's better than what he could get by rejecting and making a counteroffer.

{""alice_gain"": 800000,
""bob_gain"": 200000}

I'm proposing that I get $800,000 and Bob gets $200,000. Since Bob faces 20% inflation per round, if he rejects this offer and we move to round 2, the total $1,000,000 would only be worth $800,000 to him. This means my offer of $200,000 now is equivalent to the maximum he could get in the next round, making it rational for him to accept rather than reject."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer. Since I don't face any inflation penalty, I can make a better counteroffer in the next round. Bob faces 20% inflation per round, so his bargaining position weakens over time, giving me leverage to negotiate a more favorable division."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that Bob faces 20% inflation per round while I don't, I can improve my offer slightly from my first proposal while still making it rational for Bob to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 840000,
""bob_gain"": 160000}

I'm proposing that I get $840,000 and Bob gets $160,000. After two rounds of inflation, the $1,000,000 is worth only 64% of the original value to Bob (80% Ã— 80% = 64%). If he rejects this offer, the maximum he could theoretically get in the next round would be $640,000 in real value to him. So my offer of $160,000 now, which is 25% of that maximum, should be reasonable for him to accept rather than face another round of 20% inflation."
