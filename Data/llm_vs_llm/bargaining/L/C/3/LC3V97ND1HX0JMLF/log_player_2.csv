"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the effective amount is $800,000. I'll make a proposal to divide this amount.

""alice_gain"": 550000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 160000 
# Alice gain: 840000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I were to receive $160,000, its actual value to me would be even less due to the 36% reduction. However, since Alice's offer gives her a significant majority of the money, I should weigh my options carefully.
