55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob! I'm proposing a fair split that recognizes our different inflation situations. Since your money loses value faster (20% per round vs my 5%), it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. This split gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging the slight advantage I have in waiting. Let's avoid multiple rounds where we both lose value.",Alice,1,

40.0,60.0,"Alice, I understand your point about the inflation difference, but your initial offer was too skewed towards your favor. This is a more balanced proposal that ensures we both benefit significantly. Let's close the deal and avoid further losses.",Bob,2,

52.0,48.0,"Bob, I've reconsidered and am offering you a better deal. With your 20% inflation rate per round versus my 5%, waiting is especially costly for you. If we go another round, your $60 would be worth only $48 to you, while my losses are smaller. This offer of $48 for you is actually worth more to you now than waiting another round would be. Let's conclude this now so we both come out ahead.",Alice,3,
