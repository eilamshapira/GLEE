"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an initial offer to Bob that takes into account our different inflation rates.

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm proposing a fair split that recognizes our different inflation situations. Since your money loses value faster (20% per round vs my 5%), it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. This split gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging the slight advantage I have in waiting. Let's avoid multiple rounds where we both lose value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your point about the inflation difference, but your initial offer was too skewed towards your favor. This is a more balanced proposal that ensures we both benefit significantly. Let's close the deal and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, 
""bob_gain"": 48, 
""message"": ""Bob, I've reconsidered and am offering you a better deal. With your 20% inflation rate per round versus my 5%, waiting is especially costly for you. If we go another round, your $60 would be worth only $48 to you, while my losses are smaller. This offer of $48 for you is actually worth more to you now than waiting another round would be. Let's conclude this now so we both come out ahead.""}"
