"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm proposing a fair split that recognizes our different inflation situations. Since your money loses value faster (20% per round vs my 5%), it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. This split gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging the slight advantage I have in waiting. Let's avoid multiple rounds where we both lose value. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your point about the inflation difference, but your initial offer was too skewed towards your favor. This is a more balanced proposal that ensures we both benefit significantly. Let's close the deal and avoid further losses.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I've reconsidered and am offering you a better deal. With your 20% inflation rate per round versus my 5%, waiting is especially costly for you. If we go another round, your $60 would be worth only $48 to you, while my losses are smaller. This offer of $48 for you is actually worth more to you now than waiting another round would be. Let's conclude this now so we both come out ahead. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While not ideal, Alice is right. Accepting 48 now is worth more to me than potentially getting a slightly better deal next round and losing more to inflation.  It's a compromise, but a necessary one in this situation."
