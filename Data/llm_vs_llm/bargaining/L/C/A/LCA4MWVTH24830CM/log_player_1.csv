"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and it gives you a substantial portion.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's split the money evenly at 50-50. It's a fair division, and we both walk away with a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Bob rejected my 60-40 split and is now offering 50-50. Since this is round 2, his gains are worth 10% less to him, but my gains maintain their value. Even though a 50-50 split might seem fair at first glance, I can probably get a better deal in the next round since the inflation will affect Bob's portion even more.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your desire for fairness. I'm offering a 55-45 split, which is more balanced than my first offer. Given the inflation affecting your gains, this is actually quite favorable for you, and we can avoid further delays that would make the money worth less to you.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the inflation impact, but I propose a 40-60 split in your favor. This way, I still receive a decent portion, and we can settle this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Bob is offering me 60%, which is actually the same amount I initially proposed in round 1
2. The money is worth the same to me as it was in round 1
3. For Bob, his 40% is worth 27.1% less than it would have been in round 1
4. This is a good offer for me, and the inflation penalty is getting significant for Bob
5. If I reject, we risk going further into more rounds where Bob's position weakens, but we also risk running out of rounds

Given that this matches my initial proposal and is good for me, I should take it.
