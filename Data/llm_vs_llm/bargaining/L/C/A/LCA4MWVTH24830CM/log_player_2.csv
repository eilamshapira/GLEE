"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your desire for fairness. I'm offering a 55-45 split, which is more balanced than my first offer. Given the inflation affecting your gains, this is actually quite favorable for you, and we can avoid further delays that would make the money worth less to you.

# Alice gain: 55
