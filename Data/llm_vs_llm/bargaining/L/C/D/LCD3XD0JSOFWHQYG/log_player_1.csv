"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, considering I need to make it attractive enough for Bob to accept, while accounting for the 20% inflation penalty if we move to the next round.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000. This is a reasonable split that gives me a slight advantage while still being fair enough for Bob to seriously consider accepting."
