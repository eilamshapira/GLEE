"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a division that takes into account that Bob's money loses 10% value each round, while mine doesn't. This gives me some negotiating leverage, as waiting is more costly for Bob than for me.

I'll start with a somewhat aggressive but not extreme offer:

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

This offer gives Bob a significant amount while acknowledging my stronger negotiating position. If Bob rejects this, their next round's $300,000 would actually be worth only $270,000 to them due to the 10% devaluation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject this offer. Since I don't suffer from inflation effects, I can afford to be patient. For Bob, each round makes their share worth 10% less, while my share maintains its value. Bob's position will weaken in subsequent rounds, so I can likely get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that we're now in round 3, and Bob's money is worth 20% less than in round 1, I'll make a strategic offer that reflects this weakened position while still being more reasonable than my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}

This offer is more generous than my first one (700k/300k) but still maintains my advantage. For Bob, this 350,000 is actually worth only 280,000 due to the 20% inflation they've experienced. If they reject this, their money will be worth even less next round, so this should be more appealing than my first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject this offer. While it's a 50-50 split nominally, Bob's position continues to weaken with each round due to inflation. Their 500,000 is actually worth only about 364,500 to them (due to 27.1% inflation), while my 500,000 maintains full value. I can likely get a better deal by waiting, as Bob's inflation penalty will continue to increase.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that we're now in round 5, and Bob's money is worth about 34% less than in round 1, I'll make an offer that recognizes this deteriorating position but is still more appealing than my previous offers:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

This is my most generous offer yet, improving from my previous 650k/350k split. However, I maintain my advantage while giving Bob a more attractive option. For Bob, this 400,000 is actually worth only about 264,000 due to their cumulative inflation. If they reject this, their position will continue to weaken, so this should be more appealing than waiting for future rounds where their share will be worth even less."
