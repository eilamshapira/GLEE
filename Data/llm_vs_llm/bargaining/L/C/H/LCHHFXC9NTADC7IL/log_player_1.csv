Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, let's factor in the 5% loss in value for me. It's important to secure a reasonable amount now. Since Bob rejected a 95/5 split initially, I need to be a bit more generous, but still prioritize my gain, considering the inflation.

I need to make an offer that's enticing enough for Bob to accept, but still leaves me with a worthwhile amount after the value decrease. Let's try to find a middle ground, leaning a bit more towards his side this time.
