"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40 in my favor to account for inflation risks. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $400,000 while she gets $600,000. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value will be reduced by 20% due to inflation (at least for me), meaning we'd be dividing $800,000 instead of $1,000,000.

If we divided that equally in the next round, I'd get $400,000, which is the same as Alice's current offer. But there's no guarantee Alice would accept an equal split, and if we go to a third round, the money would be worth even less.

Given that I face definite inflation penalties and don't know how inflation affects Alice, taking the guaranteed $400,000 now seems reasonable.
