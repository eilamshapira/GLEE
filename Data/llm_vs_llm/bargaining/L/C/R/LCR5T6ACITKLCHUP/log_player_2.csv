"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer and consider whether to accept it or reject it.

Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair on the surface. However, I need to consider the inflation effect on my side.

If I reject and propose in the next round, the money will be worth 10% less to me. If I were to propose a better split for myself (say 60-40), even with the 10% inflation, I would get 60 Ã— 0.9 = 54, which is better than the current 50.

However, Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation for me. Since I don't know how inflation affects Alice, she might be more patient than me.

Given the uncertainty and guaranteed even split now, I'll accept this fair offer.
