"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

The offer is $40 for me and $60 for Alice. If I reject, we move to the next round where I can make an offer, but the money will be worth 20% less to me, meaning my $40 would become worth $32.

While I could try to negotiate for more in the next round, the risk of continued inflation and the possibility of Alice rejecting my counter-offer makes this current offer somewhat reasonable. It's not an equal split, but it's still a significant amount.
