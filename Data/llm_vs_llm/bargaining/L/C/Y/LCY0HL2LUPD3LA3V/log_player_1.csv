"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Taking inflation into account, the $500,000 Alice would receive in Round 2 is equivalent to $500,000 * 0.80 = $400,000 in Round 1 terms.

Considering I offered Bob $400,000 in the first round, I will **reject** Bob's offer.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 3, taking into account the inflation since Round 1:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent value of the $450,000 Alice would receive in Round 4 compared to Round 1, considering the 48.8% inflation:

$450,000 * (1 - 0.488) = $450,000 * 0.512 = $230,400

In Round 1 terms, this offer is equivalent to receiving $230,400. I need to compare this to what I think I could get in later rounds. Considering the high rate of inflation, it may be a good idea to accept this offer if it makes sense.

I offered Bob $300,000 in the last round, and he rejected. I believe the offer from Bob is somehow reasonable. I will accept it.
