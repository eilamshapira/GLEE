"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split, considering the inflation risk I face if negotiations drag on. A 60-40 split in my favor seems reasonable given that I'm affected by inflation in future rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. This is a fair offer considering that waiting will cost me 20% per round, while Bob's inflation rate is unknown."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this... 

With 20% inflation for me, if I accept this offer now:
$5000 Ã— 0.8 = $4000 effective value for me

If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount I get will be worth another 20% less. The risk of further negotiation rounds reducing my effective gain is significant.

A $4000 effective value isn't ideal, but it's a reasonable amount considering the inflation risk, and we're already in round 2.
