"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each round, I'll make a fair offer. Considering the inflation, I'll propose a division that is slightly in my favor to account for the decreasing value.

""alice_gain"": 480000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $420,000 I would gain is actually worth approximately $340,000 in the first round's value (since it's 19% less). This is still a bit lower than I had hoped for, but the inflation is starting to take its toll.
