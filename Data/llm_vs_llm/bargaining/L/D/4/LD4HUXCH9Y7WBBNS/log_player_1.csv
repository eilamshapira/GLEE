Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's make this fair and efficient.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since your money is worth 20% less this round, this 400k offer is actually worth 320k to you. If you reject, it will be worth even less next round. This is your best option now - I suggest you accept. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

The $400,000 offered to me is actually worth $320,000 (80% of original value) due to inflation.
If I reject and we go to the next round:
- Any amount I get will be worth only 60% of its original value
- I could propose again, but Bob would likely reject, leading to even worse terms
- Bob has no inflation penalty, so he can afford to wait

While this isn't the most favorable split, it's better than risking further devaluation of my share.
