"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make this fair and efficient. I'm offering you a generous $450000 while I take $550000. If you decline, the money will be worth less for me in the next round due to inflation, making us both worse off. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer gives me $450,000
2. If I reject, in the next round:
   - For me: money keeps its value
   - For Alice: money worth 20% less
3. In next round, I can propose a split that gives me more, knowing Alice's money will be worth less to her
4. If I propose something like 600k/400k in next round:
   - For me: 600k
   - For Alice: 400k * 0.8 = 320k equivalent value

Since I can get a better deal in the next round due to Alice's inflation penalty, I should reject this offer.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a strategic offer considering Alice's 20% inflation penalty:

{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Since your money is worth 20% less this round, this 400k offer is actually worth 320k to you. If you reject, it will be worth even less next round. This is your best option now - I suggest you accept.""}"
