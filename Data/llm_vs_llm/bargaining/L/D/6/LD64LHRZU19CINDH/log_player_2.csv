Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a better deal for you 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this offer gives you a slight advantage over equal split. Let's settle before it decreases further.""}

My reasoning for this offer is that considering the inflation rate for Alice is lower than mine, giving her a slight advantage might entice her to accept the offer. This way, we can both walk away with a considerable amount before the money loses more value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is hitting you harder, take this before it's too late 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Although Alice's offer is not the most favorable, the inflation is affecting me more severely than it is affecting her. If I reject this offer, the value of the money I gain in the next rounds will decrease significantly, leaving me with much less. Therefore, it's in my best interest to accept this offer and secure my gain before it's too late."
