"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, 
""alice_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I need a bit more. This is still a generous offer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concern about inflation. Let's compromise with a 45-55 split in your favor. This is a fair middle ground that acknowledges inflation while still giving us both a reasonable share. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45
