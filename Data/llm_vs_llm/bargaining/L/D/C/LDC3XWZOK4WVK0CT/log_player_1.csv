Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the impact of inflation on our shares, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This offer takes into account the rapid decrease in value for you and ensures we both walk away with significant amounts before the money loses too much value. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
