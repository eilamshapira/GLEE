"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's split the money 60/40. This is a fair offer considering the inflation we are facing and my effort to propose first.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your proposal.  I think a 55/45 split is more reflective of the risk I'm taking by letting this deal go another round with inflation looming. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
