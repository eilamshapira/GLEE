50.0,50.0,"Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but your initial offer was too favorable toward you. Let's do a fair 50-50 split. This is better for you than waiting another round where your 50 would be worth only 45 to you due to inflation. I think this is equitable for both of us.",Bob,2,
