"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I propose we split the money with me getting 60$ and you getting 40$. This way, we both get a fair share considering the inflation affecting me.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but your initial offer was too favorable toward you. Let's do a fair 50-50 split. This is better for you than waiting another round where your 50 would be worth only 45 to you due to inflation. I think this is equitable for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
