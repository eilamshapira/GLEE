"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the money with me getting 60$ and you getting 40$. This way, we both get a fair share considering the inflation affecting me. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's proposal carefully. She's offering me $40 and keeping $60 for herself, arguing this is fair due to her 10% inflation penalty per round.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, Alice would face a 10% reduction in value (money worth 90% to her), while my money retains full value. This gives me negotiating leverage.

Since I don't face inflation penalties, it would be better for me to negotiate for a more favorable split - perhaps closer to 50-50 or even better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that acknowledges the inflation factor Alice faces while still improving my position:

{""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but your initial offer was too favorable toward you. Let's do a fair 50-50 split. This is better for you than waiting another round where your 50 would be worth only 45 to you due to inflation. I think this is equitable for both of us.""}"
