"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, fair and square! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

If I reject this offer, in the next round:
1. I can make my own proposal
2. But the money will be worth 10% less to me
3. So the $50 offered now would be equivalent to $55.56 in the next round

Since this is a fair 50-50 split and getting more than $50 would require overcoming the 10% inflation penalty, this seems like a reasonable offer to accept.
