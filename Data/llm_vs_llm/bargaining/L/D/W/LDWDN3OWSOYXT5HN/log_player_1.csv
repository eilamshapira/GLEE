"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to make an offer to Bob, considering that the money loses 10% of its value for me each round, while it stays the same for Bob. This creates time pressure for me, so I should offer a fair split that Bob would accept.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

A 50-50 split is fair and reasonable. Since money depreciates for me by 10% each round, it's in my interest to reach an agreement quickly. This equal division demonstrates fairness and should appeal to Bob's sense of equity."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully, weighing the 10% inflation penalty I face each round versus the current proposal.

Bob is offering me $4000, which is less than my initial 50-50 proposal. If I reject and we go to round 3, any amount I would receive would be worth 20% less due to inflation. So $4000 now is equivalent to $5000 in round 1, and would be equivalent to getting $5000 in round 3.

If I reject, I can make a new offer, but Bob might reject again, pushing us to later rounds where inflation hurts me more. Since Bob faces no inflation penalty, he has a strategic advantage by delaying.

Given these considerations:
