Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first move and taking initiative. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering a more balanced split of 55-45 in my favor. This is more favorable to you than my first offer, and given that inflation is affecting your gains each round, it would be wise to accept this now rather than continue negotiating.

# Alice gain: 55
