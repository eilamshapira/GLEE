With inflation affecting me at 10% per round, delaying further would reduce the value of my share substantially. This is a reasonable and fair offer.",Bob,2,

600000.0,400000.0,"Alice, I understand that inflation affects me but not you, giving you leverage. Instead of dragging this out where my share loses value every round, I'm offering a reasonable 40-60 split in your favor. This acknowledges your stronger position while still being fair. If we continue for many more rounds, inflation will significantly reduce my share's value, and neither of us benefits if this goes to round 12 with no agreement. This is a pragmatic solution that works for both of us.",Bob,4,
