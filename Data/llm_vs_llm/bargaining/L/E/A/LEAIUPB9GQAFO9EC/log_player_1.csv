Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. We both deserve an equal share, and this way we can both walk away with a significant amount. With inflation affecting me at 10% per round, delaying further would reduce the value of my share substantially. This is a reasonable and fair offer. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that inflation affects me but not you, giving you leverage. Instead of dragging this out where my share loses value every round, I'm offering a reasonable 40-60 split in your favor. This acknowledges your stronger position while still being fair. If we continue for many more rounds, inflation will significantly reduce my share's value, and neither of us benefits if this goes to round 12 with no agreement. This is a pragmatic solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000
