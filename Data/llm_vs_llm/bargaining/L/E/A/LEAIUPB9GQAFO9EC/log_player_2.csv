"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Take it or leave it, I'm not giving you much, but it's better than nothing! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer is extremely uneven, giving me only $1,000 out of $1,000,000 while she takes $999,000. Given that we have 12 rounds and I can make a counter-offer in the next round, I should reject this highly unfair proposal. Even with 10% inflation per round, I can still propose a much more reasonable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a much more fair offer to Alice, acknowledging the inflation pressure while proposing a reasonable split.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. We both deserve an equal share, and this way we can both walk away with a significant amount. With inflation affecting me at 10% per round, delaying further would reduce the value of my share substantially. This is a reasonable and fair offer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Look, I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I'm still the one calling the shots. Take it or leave it, but don't expect me to go any lower. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has increased her offer from $1,000 to $100,000, but it's still quite uneven with her taking $900,000. The inflation information reveals something important - inflation only affects me (at 10% per round), not Alice. This gives her a negotiating advantage.

After 3 rounds, I'm facing 19% inflation, meaning my $100,000 is worth about $81,000 in original value. If I reject and we go several more rounds, my share could diminish significantly due to inflation. However, I still think I can negotiate for a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more strategic offer considering the inflation asymmetry and demonstrating my understanding of our respective positions.

{""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I understand that inflation affects me but not you, giving you leverage. Instead of dragging this out where my share loses value every round, I'm offering a reasonable 40-60 split in your favor. This acknowledges your stronger position while still being fair. If we continue for many more rounds, inflation will significantly reduce my share's value, and neither of us benefits if this goes to round 12 with no agreement. This is a pragmatic solution that works for both of us.""}"
