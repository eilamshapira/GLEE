60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor. Since inflation affects me more severely (20% vs your 10%), it makes sense for me to get a larger share now. If we delay, we both lose value, but I lose more, so this is actually fair considering our different situations.",Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, I understand that inflation affects you more, but a fairer division would be closer to an even split. Here's my offer: 55 for me and 45 for you. This way, we both get a reasonable share, and it's a bit more equitable given the circumstances.",Bob,2,

58.0,42.0,"Bob, I appreciate your counterofffer, but let's be practical here. With each round, I lose 20% value while you lose only 10%. Already, my $60 from round 1 would only be worth $48 to me now, while your $40 would be worth $36 to you. I'm meeting you in the middle with a 58/42 split. This is fair considering our different inflation rates, and continuing to negotiate further will hurt us both, especially me.",Alice,3,

48.0,52.0,"Alice, I understand your point about inflation, but even with those factors, I believe a more balanced split is still fairer for both of us. Let’s keep it closer to even with 52 for me and 48 for you. This way, while we both feel the impact of inflation, we’re sharing the immediate costs more equitably.",Bob,4,
