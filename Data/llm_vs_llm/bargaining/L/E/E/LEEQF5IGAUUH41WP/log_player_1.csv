"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a swift and fair resolution to our division dilemma. To avoid the inflation penalty that eats away value as rounds pass, I'm suggesting a deal where I keep $5,500 and you receive $4,500. Let's agree now and keep things simpleâ€”what do you say?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I think an equal split is the fairest way to divide the money. This way, we both get the same amount and can avoid further inflation penalties. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
