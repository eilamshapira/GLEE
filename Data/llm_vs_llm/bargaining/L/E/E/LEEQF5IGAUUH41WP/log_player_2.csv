Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a swift and fair resolution to our division dilemma. To avoid the inflation penalty that eats away value as rounds pass, I'm suggesting a deal where I keep $5500 and you receive $4500. Let's agree now and keep things simpleâ€”what do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
