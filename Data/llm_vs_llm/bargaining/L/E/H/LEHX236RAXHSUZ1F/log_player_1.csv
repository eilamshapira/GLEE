"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I'm playing as Alice, and I need to make an offer to Bob to divide $10,000. My goal is to maximize my gain, keeping in mind the inflation that affects only me. I will make a reasonable offer to increase the likelihood of acceptance, considering this is round 1.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to evaluate this offer, considering the inflation.

*   **Bob's Offer:** Alice: $4500, Bob: $5500
*   **Inflation:** My money is worth 20% less than in Round 1.

So, receiving $4500 now is equivalent to receiving $4500 * (1 - 0.20) = $3600 in Round 1 terms.

If I reject, I risk further inflation in future rounds, and the total money may deplete at the end of round 12.

Given the circumstances, $3600 (in round 1 value) might be acceptable in round 1 value, but it depends on how much more I can negotiate later.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, now it's my turn again. Inflation is hitting me hard, and Bob's money is also decreasing. Let's factor that in.

*   **My Inflation:** My money is now worth 40% less than in Round 1 (20% per round x 2 rounds). Therefore, money * 0.6 now is equivalent to round 1 value.

*   **Bob's Inflation:** Bob's money is now worth 10% less than in Round 1 (5% per round x 2 rounds). Therefore, money * 0.9 now is equivalent to round 1 value.

I need to make an offer that is attractive enough for Bob to accept while still giving me a decent return, accounting for my inflation.
I need to secure something now or i'm not likely to get anything later.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, things are getting serious. Let's analyze Bob's offer.

*   **Bob's Offer:** Alice: $4000, Bob: $6000
*   **Inflation (Alice):** My money is worth 48.8% less than in Round 1.
*   **Inflation (Bob):** Bob's money is worth 14.26% less than in Round 1.

So, receiving $4000 now is equivalent to receiving $4000 * (1 - 0.488) = $4000 * 0.512 = $2048 in Round 1 terms.

This is a very low amount. The inflation is really hurting me. I need to think carefully. If I reject, I might get even less next round. I'm becoming desperate. Let's assume that inflation is at 20% each turn for me and 5% for him for the coming turns. If I reject, and he proposes $3500 in round 5, that would be $3500 * (1-0.6) = 1400 in round 1 money. This is the lowest I will go. Let's try to get him to give more.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I rejected Bob's low offer. Now I need to make a more compelling proposal, or I'll end up with nothing. The inflation is eating away at my potential gains. I will try to make an offer that still gives me a decent portion, while giving bob a higher cut as well.

*   **My Inflation:** My money is worth 60.96% less than in Round 1 (compounded inflation, roughly. This is a running estimate). So money * (1 - 0.6096) = money * 0.3904 now is equivalent to round 1 value.
*   **Bob's Inflation:** Bob's money is worth 18.55% less than in Round 1. (Also a running estimate). So money * (1 - 0.1855) = money * 0.8145 now is equivalent to round 1 value.

I need to make this acceptable.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, this is getting very close to the wire. Bob is offering me less and less, and the inflation is killing me. Let's analyze:

*   **Bob's Offer:** Alice: $3500, Bob: $6500
*   **Inflation (Alice):** My money is worth 67.23% less than in Round 1.
*   **Inflation (Bob):** Bob's money is worth 22.62% less than in Round 1.

So, receiving $3500 now is equivalent to receiving $3500 * (1 - 0.6723) = $3500 * 0.3277 = $1146.95 in Round 1 terms.

That's incredibly low! It's below my lowest possible gain of 1400 in round 1 terms. But how much longer can this continue?

I'm going to reject. I'd rather get nothing than accept that. I'm betting Bob will offer a better deal later.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, rejection after rejection. I'm worried. I need to try something drastic. I will make a very generous offer, hoping to secure at least *some* value before it's all gone.

*   **My Inflation:** My money is worth 73.784% less than in Round 1 (compounded inflation estimate). So money * (1 - 0.73784) = money * 0.26216 now is equivalent to round 1 value.
*   **Bob's Inflation:** Bob's money is worth 26.5% less than in Round 1 (Estimate). So money * (1 - 0.265) = money * 0.735 now is equivalent to round 1 value.

Let's try to entice Bob to accept.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 4200,
""bob_gain"": 5800
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, this is it. This might be my last chance to get anything. Bob is really pushing me to the limit. Let's analyze:

*   **Bob's Offer:** Alice: $3000, Bob: $7000
*   **Inflation (Alice):** My money is worth 79.03% less than in Round 1.
*   **Inflation (Bob):** Bob's money is worth 30.17% less than in Round 1.

So, receiving $3000 now is equivalent to receiving $3000 * (1 - 0.7903) = $3000 * 0.2097 = $629.1 in Round 1 terms.

This is terrible. It's far below my lowest acceptable offer. But if I reject, I might get *nothing*.

I really have to weigh my options. There are only 4 rounds remaining. If Bob keeps lowering the offer, and the inflation continues, I'll be left with nothing. I think I need to accept this, even though it's a bad deal. It's better than zero.
