"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
- Alice is offering me 4000$ out of 10000$
- If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
- However, the money will be worth 5% less next round
- 4000$ now is better than potentially getting nothing if we can't agree

While I could try to negotiate for more, this is a reasonable first offer giving me 40% of the pot. The risk of losing value through inflation and potential future disagreements makes accepting this offer a pragmatic choice.
