"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's end this quickly and fairly. I'm giving you a generous offer. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, 
""alice_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""My turn, let's make it more even.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's try this again. Consider this a slight improvement on your offer. Let's wrap this up! 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value I'd get is 3500 * 0.64 = 2240. 
{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Due to inflation, the money I gain is worth 36% * (1 + 0.2) = 51.2% less than in the first round, and for Alice, it's 9.75% * (1 + 0.05) = 14.7875% less. 
However, the correct calculation for the value decrease for me is: 
Round 1 to 2: 20% decrease, so 0.8 
Round 2 to 3: 20% decrease, so 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 
Round 3 to 4: 20% decrease, so 0.64 * 0.8 = 0.512 
And for Alice: 
Round 1 to 2: 5% decrease, so 0.95 
Round 2 to 3: 5% decrease, so 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025 
Round 3 to 4: 5% decrease, so 0.9025 * 0.95 = 0.857375

So I'll make an offer considering these values.
