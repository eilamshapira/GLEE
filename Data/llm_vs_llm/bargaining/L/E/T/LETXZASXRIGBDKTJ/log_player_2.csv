"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer from Alice.

She's offering me $400,000 while keeping $600,000 for herself. While this isn't an even split, it's still a substantial amount. However, considering this is just the first round and the 10% inflation penalty isn't too severe yet, I believe I can make a better counter-offer in the next round.

If I reject, the next round's total value would be $900,000 (10% less), but I would have the power to make the proposal. This could potentially lead to a more favorable outcome for me.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer, but still slightly in my favor since Alice showed she's willing to consider uneven splits. I'll propose a 55-45 split in my favor, which is less extreme than her initial 60-40 split in her favor.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

This offer gives Alice a substantial amount while being more advantageous to me than her initial proposal. It's fair enough that she might accept it to avoid the 10% inflation penalty of the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice's new offer is more balanced than her first one, shifting from 60-40 to 55-45 (in her favor)
2. Due to 19% inflation, the real value of my $450,000 would be about $364,500
3. If I reject, the next round will have even more inflation (27.1%), and I risk getting an even worse deal
4. Alice has shown she's willing to negotiate by improving her offer
5. This is a reasonable offer considering the mounting inflation pressure

While I could reject and try for a better deal, the increasing inflation makes this offer acceptable, and continuing to negotiate could leave both of us worse off.
