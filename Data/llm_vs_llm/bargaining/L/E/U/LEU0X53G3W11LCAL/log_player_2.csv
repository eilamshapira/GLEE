"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get your money immediately without risking inflation losses. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me $400,000, which isn't bad considering the total amount is $1,000,000. However, if I reject it, in the next round I can make a counter-proposal. The downside is that due to inflation, the money will be worth 20% less to me in the next round.

$400,000 now is better than potentially getting more later but having it be worth less due to inflation. If I reject and we go multiple rounds, the inflation could significantly eat into any gains.

Also, there's a risk that if we don't agree within 12 rounds, we both get nothing.

Given these factors, while 60-40 in Alice's favor isn't ideal, it's a reasonable first offer and the inflation risk makes it worth accepting.
