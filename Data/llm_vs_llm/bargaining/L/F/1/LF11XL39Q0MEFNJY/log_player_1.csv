"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make my first offer to Bob. Given that he faces a 20% reduction in value per round while I don't, I'll propose a fair split considering this asymmetry.

{""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you $40 now. If you reject and we go to the next round, the $100 will only be worth $80 to you due to your 20% inflation penalty. So this is actually a favorable deal for you compared to making a counter-offer. Let's both walk away with something reasonable today.""}"
