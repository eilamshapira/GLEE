"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, Bob. I take 60 and you take 40. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing that she gets $60 while I get $40 of the $100. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation (so the $100 would effectively be worth only $80 to me in the next round).

While a 50-50 split might seem fairest, I need to account for the inflation penalty I face. If I reject now and propose a better split next round, Alice might reject, and we'd move to round 3 with even more inflation for me.

Given the inflation risk, taking $40 now might be better than risking getting less value in future rounds.
