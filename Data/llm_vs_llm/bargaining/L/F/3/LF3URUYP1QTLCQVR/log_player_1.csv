"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll play as Alice in this game. Since I should be wary of inflation (each round makes the money worth 20% less for me), I should make a reasonable first offer that Bob might accept.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest this division because it gives me a slight advantage while still being fair enough that Bob might accept it rather than moving to the next round. If we move to the next round, the total value to me will decrease by 20%, making it advantageous to reach an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

While I understand that inflation affects my gains, Bob's offer gives him significantly more ($60) while giving me only $40, which after the 20% inflation is effectively worth $32 to me. I believe we can reach a more equitable agreement in the next round, even accounting for the continued inflation effect."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to consider the inflation effect carefully now. The money is worth 40% less to me in this round than in the first round, so I should adjust my offer to reach an agreement.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm offering an equal split of the money. While my $50 is effectively worth only $30 to me due to the 40% inflation over three rounds, I think this is a fair compromise that Bob should find acceptable. An equal division represents a balanced position that acknowledges both our interests, and it helps us avoid further inflation in later rounds."
