Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know you want a fair split, and refusing in later rounds only means both of us lose value due to the discount. By accepting, you secure a guaranteed $4000, which is better than risking further losses. Let's settle now and both walk away with a substantial amount!

# Bob gain: 6000
