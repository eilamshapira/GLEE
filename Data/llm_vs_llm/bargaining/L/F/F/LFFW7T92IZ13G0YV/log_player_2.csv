"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice proposes I get $4,000 and she gets $6,000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, the total amount will be worth 20% less next round (only $8,000 total)
4. My $4,000 now is better than a maximum of $4,800 (60% of $8,000) in the next round

While the split isn't exactly 50-50, getting $4,000 now is better than risking further negotiations with diminishing value. It's a reasonable offer.
