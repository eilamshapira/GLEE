"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
- She's offering me $40 and keeping $60
- If I reject, we move to next round where I can make an offer
- But the total value will decrease by 10% to $90
- I could propose a more favorable split, but Alice might reject
- The risk of multiple rejections could lead to significant value loss

Given that $40 is a reasonable offer (40% of the pot) and avoiding the risk of value deterioration, I'll accept.
