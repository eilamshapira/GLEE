"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make my first offer to Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

Since this is the first round, I want to propose a fair division that slightly favors me but still gives Bob a substantial portion. I believe this is reasonable as both of us want to reach an agreement quickly due to inflation affecting our potential gains."
