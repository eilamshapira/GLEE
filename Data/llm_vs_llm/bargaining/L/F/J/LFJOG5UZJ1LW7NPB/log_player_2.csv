"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically:

1. The offer gives me $45 and Alice $55
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation for me:
   - In the next round, $100 will be worth $95 to me
   - So even if I got a better split next round, I need to factor in this loss

The current offer of $45 is fairly reasonable, considering:
- It's close to a 50-50 split
- Rejecting means risking value loss due to inflation
- Alice's inflation rate is higher (10%), which gives me some leverage, but also means we should try to conclude quickly
- We have limited rounds and need to reach agreement
