"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer:

Alice is proposing an even 50-50 split of the $10,000, giving each of us $5,000.

This is a perfectly fair distribution that respects both players equally. While I could potentially get more by rejecting and making my own proposal in the next round, there's always the risk that we might end up with less agreement later.

Since the money isn't losing value for me through inflation (0% inflation rate), there's no monetary pressure to accept immediately. However, a fair split now guarantees I walk away with a reasonable amount.
