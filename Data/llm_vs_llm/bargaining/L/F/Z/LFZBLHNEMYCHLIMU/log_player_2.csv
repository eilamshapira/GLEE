"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering me $40 while taking $60 for herself. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, I would need to consider that the total amount will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation. 

Let me think about this: If I reject, the $100 will be worth $95 to me in the next round. If I could get more than $40/$95 â‰ˆ 42.1% of that in my counter-offer, it might be worth rejecting. However, there's uncertainty about whether Alice would accept my counter-offer, potentially leading to further rounds and more inflation.

Given that $40 is a substantial portion (40%) of the total, and the certainty of getting this amount now versus the risk of continued negotiation with decreasing value, I'll accept this offer.
