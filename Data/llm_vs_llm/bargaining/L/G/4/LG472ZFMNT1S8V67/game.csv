60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob! I'm suggesting we split the money 60/40. Since inflation affects me but not you, I'm proposing a slightly higher amount for myself. If we keep going back and forth for several rounds, we'll both end up with less total value due to my inflation penalty. Let's make a fair deal now and both walk away happy!",Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice! I understand your concern about inflation, but a 60/40 split is too uneven. I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is still favorable to you considering we're in early rounds. This way, even with some inflation, you'll get a fair amount. Let's settle this now and both benefit.",Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob. I appreciate your acknowledgment of the inflation issue. However, as we're now in round 3, inflation is already starting to affect me. At a 20% devaluation per round, I need to account for that. A 55/45 split seems fair given these circumstances. Let's agree and end the game now - further rounds will only hurt both of our total values due to increasing inflation on my side.",Alice,3,
