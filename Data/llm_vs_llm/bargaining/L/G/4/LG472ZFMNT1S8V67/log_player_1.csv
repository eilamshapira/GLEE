"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm suggesting we split the money 60/40. Since inflation affects me but not you, I'm proposing a slightly higher amount for myself. If we keep going back and forth for several rounds, we'll both end up with less total value due to my inflation penalty. Let's make a fair deal now and both walk away happy!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice! I understand your concern about inflation, but a 60/40 split is too uneven. I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is still favorable to you considering we're in early rounds. This way, even with some inflation, you'll get a fair amount. Let's settle this now and both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob. I appreciate your acknowledgment of the inflation issue. However, as we're now in round 3, inflation is already starting to affect me. At a 20% devaluation per round, I need to account for that. A 55/45 split seems fair given these circumstances. Let's agree and end the game now - further rounds will only hurt both of our total values due to increasing inflation on my side.""}"
