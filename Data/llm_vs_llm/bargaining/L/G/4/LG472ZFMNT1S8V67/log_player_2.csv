"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm suggesting we split the money 60/40. Since inflation affects me but not you, I'm proposing a slightly higher amount for myself. If we keep going back and forth for several rounds, we'll both end up with less total value due to my inflation penalty. Let's make a fair deal now and both walk away happy! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think through this:

1. Alice's reasoning about inflation affecting her is true - her money loses 20% value each round
2. However, her initial offer of 60/40 in her favor seems a bit too aggressive
3. Since I'm not affected by inflation, I can afford to negotiate
4. Even if we go a few rounds, my money won't lose value
5. I can propose a more balanced split in the next round
6. There are still 11 rounds left, giving plenty of room for negotiation

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced counter-offer:

{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Hi Alice! I understand your concern about inflation, but a 60/40 split is too uneven. I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is still favorable to you considering we're in early rounds. This way, even with some inflation, you'll get a fair amount. Let's settle this now and both benefit.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob. I appreciate your acknowledgment of the inflation issue. However, as we're now in round 3, inflation is already starting to affect me. At a 20% devaluation per round, I need to account for that. A 55/45 split seems fair given these circumstances. Let's agree and end the game now - further rounds will only hurt both of our total values due to increasing inflation on my side. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice has moved from her initial 60/40 to 55/45, which shows willingness to negotiate
2. She's right that inflation is already affecting her - her money is worth 36% less now
3. If I reject, we'll go to round 4, and her money will be worth even less
4. The 45/55 split is actually quite reasonable given:
   - She's facing significant inflation (36% already)
   - We're 3 rounds in
   - She's moved significantly from her initial position
5. Further negotiation might lead to both of us getting less value
