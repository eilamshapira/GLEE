"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing I get $40 while she gets $60. Since this is the first round, if I reject, I'll make a counteroffer next round, but the total value will decrease by 10% for me (so the $100 will be worth $90 to me).

Given the inflation penalty for me but not for Alice, I need to weigh whether I'm likely to get a better outcome by negotiating further. If I reject and we go multiple rounds, the decreasing value will significantly hurt my position.
