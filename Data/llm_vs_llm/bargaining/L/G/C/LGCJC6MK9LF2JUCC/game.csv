600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This is fair considering that if we go to another round, the total value decreases for me by 20%, meaning we'd be dividing effectively $800000 from my perspective. Let's make a deal now and both walk away with substantial amounts.",Alice,1,

750000.0,250000.0,"Alice, consider this: if you reject my proposal today, you'll move on to the next round and face further discount—your money will be worth 40% less than its nominal value. In round 3, as proposer, even if you secured nearly everything, you'd effectively get around $600000. My offer gives you $750000 nominally (which is worth $600000 to you today), so it’s as good as your best alternative, while sparing us both the extra delay. Let's seal the deal now!",Bob,2,
