"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make my offer to Bob, being mindful that time works against me due to the 20% inflation penalty per round.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This is fair considering that if we go to another round, the total value decreases for me by 20%, meaning we'd be dividing effectively $800,000 from my perspective. Let's make a deal now and both walk away with substantial amounts.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, consider this: if you reject my proposal today, you'll move on to the next round and face further discount—your money will be worth 40% less than its nominal value. In round 3, as proposer, even if you secured nearly everything, you'd effectively get around $600000. My offer gives you $750000 nominally (which is worth $600000 to you today), so it’s as good as your best alternative, while sparing us both the extra delay. Let's seal the deal now! 
# Alice gain: 750000 
# Bob gain: 250000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Bob's offer carefully, considering the inflation penalty.

Bob is offering me $750,000, which with the 20% inflation in this round, is worth $600,000 to me now. He's pointing out that if I reject this and make a counter-offer in round 3, the money would be worth 40% less to me, making even the full million worth only about $600,000 to me.

His analysis is correct - this offer gives me approximately the same effective value that I could hope to get in the next round, even with an extremely favorable proposal. Given the inflation penalty I face, this is actually a fair offer.
