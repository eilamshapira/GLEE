"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This is fair considering that if we go to another round, the total value decreases for me by 20%, meaning we'd be dividing effectively $800000 from my perspective. Let's make a deal now and both walk away with substantial amounts. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 250000, ""alice_gain"": 750000, ""message"": ""Alice, consider this: if you reject my proposal today, you'll move on to the next round and face further discount—your money will be worth 40% less than its nominal value. In round 3, as proposer, even if you secured nearly everything, you'd effectively get around $600,000. My offer gives you $750,000 nominally (which is worth $600,000 to you today), so it’s as good as your best alternative, while sparing us both the extra delay. Let's seal the deal now!""}"
