Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, considering inflation and Bob's offer:

Since my money is worth 5% less, the effective value of $40 now is less than the original value. 

Therefore:
```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
