"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll start with a fair offer that gives us an equal split.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 50-50 split which is fair for both of us. This way we both walk away with an equal amount.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm offering a 55-45 split. It's still fair, and considering the inflation, it's better for both of us to end the game sooner rather than later. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to decide whether to accept Bob's offer of $45 for me and $55 for him.

Since I don't face any inflation (the money is worth the same to me in all rounds), there's no urgency for me to accept an unfair split. I can make a counter-offer in the next round.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a slightly adjusted offer that recognizes Bob's inflation concern while being more favorable to myself than his proposal.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 48,
  ""bob_gain"": 52,
  ""message"": ""Bob, I understand your concern about inflation affecting your gains. I'm offering you $52, which is more than my initial 50-50 split but still fair to both of us. Let's conclude this deal now since waiting will only reduce the value for you due to inflation.""
}
