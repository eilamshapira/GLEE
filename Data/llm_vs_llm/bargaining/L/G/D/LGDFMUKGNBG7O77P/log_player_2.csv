"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 50-50 split which is fair for both of us. This way we both walk away with an equal amount.

# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm offering a 55-45 split. It's still fair, and considering the inflation, it's better for both of us to end the game sooner rather than later.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concern about inflation affecting your gains. I'm offering you $52, which is more than my initial 50-50 split but still fair to both of us. Let's conclude this deal now since waiting will only reduce the value for you due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
