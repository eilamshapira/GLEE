Let's see if Bob is generous!  I'm offering him a small share, hoping he'll want to accept quickly to avoid any inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm rejecting this offer. While it's a significant amount, I'm not sure how much longer I can keep playing without my share of the money getting eaten away by inflation. I'm willing to take a gamble and see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm raising my share a bit, hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise.  We're both losing money with each passing round, so hopefully we can find a solution soon."
