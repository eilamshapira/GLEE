"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer to Bob, considering the inflation effect on my gains.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm offering Bob a substantial portion of $400,000 while requesting $600,000 for myself. This is a fair starting offer since I'm facing 5% inflation with each passing round, which reduces the value of my potential earnings if we delay agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer. Since Bob has offered me the same split that I initially proposed ($600,000 for me, $400,000 for Bob), and considering that inflation will continue to reduce the value of my gains in future rounds, accepting now is the rational choice. With each round, my $600,000 would be worth less due to the 5% inflation, so there's no benefit in prolonging the negotiation."
