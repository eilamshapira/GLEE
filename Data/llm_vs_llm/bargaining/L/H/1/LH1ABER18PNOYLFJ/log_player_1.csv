"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair offer to Bob, keeping in mind that inflation will affect me by 10% each round.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I suggest a perfectly even split of the money. This is fair and should be acceptable to both of us. Let's avoid the effects of inflation by reaching an agreement now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I see that Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation pressure on me. Let me make a counteroffer.

{""alice_gain"": 5100, ""bob_gain"": 4900}

I'm offering a slightly better deal for myself to compensate for the inflation effects I'm experiencing. This is still a very fair division that leaves both of us with nearly equal amounts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I notice Bob is consistently pushing for an increasingly larger share. Given the inflation pressure on me, I need to find a reasonable compromise.

{""alice_gain"": 4800, ""bob_gain"": 5200}

I'm offering a fair split that acknowledges Bob's apparent desire for more than half while still ensuring I receive a reasonable amount. This compromise should be acceptable to both of us, and it's better for us to reach an agreement now before inflation reduces the value further for me."
