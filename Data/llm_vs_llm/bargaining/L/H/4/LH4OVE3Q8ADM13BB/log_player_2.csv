"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Alice in each round, I'll take that into account for my offer.

For me (Bob), the money is now worth $1,000,000 * 0.95 = $950,000.
For Alice, the money is now worth $1,000,000 * 0.80 = $800,000.

Considering this, my offer is:
{""bob_gain"": 570000, ""alice_gain"": 430000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value of the money I would gain is:
$1,000,000 * (1 - 0.0975) = $902,500 (total possible value)
$200,000 (offer) / $902,500 (total possible value) = approximately 0.222 or 22.2% of the total possible value.

The actual value of the money Alice would gain is:
$1,000,000 * (1 - 0.36) = $640,000 (total possible value)
$800,000 (offer) / $640,000 (total possible value) = approximately 1.25 or 125% of the total possible value, but since she can't get more than the total value, this is not possible. The offer is $800,000, but the total possible value is $640,000.

Since the offer seems to be more in Alice's favor and I can try to get a better deal, I will reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me in each round, and we are in round 4, the total decrease in value for me is:
0.95 (round 1) * 0.95 (round 2) * 0.95 (round 3) = 0.857375
The money is now worth $1,000,000 * 0.857375 = $857,375 for me.

For Alice, the money is worth 20% less in each round, so the total decrease in value for her is:
0.80 (round 1) * 0.80 (round 2) * 0.80 (round 3) = 0.512
The money is now worth $1,000,000 * 0.512 = $512,000 for Alice.

Considering this, my offer is:
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}"
