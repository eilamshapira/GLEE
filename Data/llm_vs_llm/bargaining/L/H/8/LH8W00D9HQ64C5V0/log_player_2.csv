Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me after the first round, the effective amount is now $900,000 for me. However, I'll make an offer based on the original $1,000,000 to simplify the negotiation.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 520000 
# Alice gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Alice's offer, the $520,000 I gain is actually worth $520,000 * 0.81 (1 - 0.19) = $420,800 to me.

However, I'll evaluate the offer based on its face value and the fact that Alice's gain is also devalued.
