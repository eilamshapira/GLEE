"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a fair split where I get slightly more as a first-mover. If we delay, inflation will hurt both of us. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice offers me $450,000 while taking $550,000
2. If I reject, next round I can make an offer, but my money will be worth 20% less
3. $450,000 now is better than $500,000 next round (which would be worth $400,000 to me due to inflation)
4. There's no guarantee Alice would accept my counter-offer, leading to more rounds and more value loss

Given the significant inflation penalty and that this is a reasonable first offer, I should accept.
