"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. This ensures we both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Okay, let's recalculate. My perceived value of the money is now 90% of what it was in round one, but since it's *after* his rejection, I need to adjust my thinking. He's playing hardball. However, further delays hurt me disproportionately. I need to make an offer that is enticing but also accounts for the increasing cost to me.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 48,
  ""bob_gain"": 52,
  ""message"": ""Okay Bob, my last offer was clearly not appealing. I'll take less; inflation is really hurting me. This is my best offer.""
}
