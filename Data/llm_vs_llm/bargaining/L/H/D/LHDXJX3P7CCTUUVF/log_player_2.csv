"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

* Alice offered me $40, keeping $60 for herself
* If I reject and go to next round, there will be 20% inflation for me
* In round 2, my $40 would only be worth $32 in round 1 terms
* Even if I propose a better split next round, I'll lose value due to inflation
* $40 now is better than potentially getting more that's worth less
