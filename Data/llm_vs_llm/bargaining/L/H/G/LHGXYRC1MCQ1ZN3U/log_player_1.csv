"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split but slightly in my favor since Bob has the power to accept/reject and make a counter-offer.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}

I propose I get $5,200 and Bob gets $4,800. This is a fair and reasonable split that gives Bob a substantial portion while maintaining a small advantage for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
* If I accept Bob's offer of $5000, due to 10% inflation, it's actually worth $4500 to me
* If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount I get will be worth another 10% less
* The risk of further negotiation rounds could lead to even more value loss
* This is a fairly equal split, and fighting for a bit more might cost us both due to inflation

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer. While not ideal, it's a reasonable compromise and avoiding further inflation is the smart move."
