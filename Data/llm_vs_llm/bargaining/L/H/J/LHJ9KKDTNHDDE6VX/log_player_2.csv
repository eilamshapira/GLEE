Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to be generous, but a 60/40 split in your favor isn't fair. How about we try a 55/45 split?""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's try this again. I've adjusted my offer to be closer to a fair split.  I'm still willing to work with you here. 
# Bob gain: 520000 
# Alice gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll take it.  While not ideal, the effects of inflation are starting to add up, and it's better to secure something now than risk getting even less later."
