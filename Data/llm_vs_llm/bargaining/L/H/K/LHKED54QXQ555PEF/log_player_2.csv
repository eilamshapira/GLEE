"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I propose a division where I receive $550,000 and Alice receives $450,000. This gives us both a substantial amount, but accounts for the fact that I'm facing 5% inflation per round, which affects the real value of my share."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I propose a division where I receive $600,000 and Alice receives $400,000. Since I'm affected by inflation (already about 15% by next round) and Alice isn't experiencing any inflation based on the information provided, I need to secure a larger nominal amount to offset my decreasing purchasing power."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I propose a division where I receive $550,000 and Alice receives $450,000. I've adjusted my previous offer to be more favorable to Alice, recognizing that we need to reach an agreement soon. With inflation continuing to affect only my share, we should find a fair middle ground that works for both of us."
