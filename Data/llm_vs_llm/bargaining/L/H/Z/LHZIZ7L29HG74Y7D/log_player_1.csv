"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me propose a fair split that accounts for the different inflation rates we face.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I suggest I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. This slightly higher split for me accounts for my higher inflation rate (10% vs 5%). It's a reasonable first offer that leaves both of us with a substantial sum while acknowledging our different positions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept, I get $4,800, but it's worth 10% less than in round 1, so effectively $4,320
- If I reject, we go to next round where I can make an offer, but values will decrease further
- The difference between his share and mine is only $400
- Getting a deal sooner is valuable due to inflation
- Bob has shown he's willing to make a relatively fair offer

Given these factors, especially the impact of inflation and the reasonableness of the split, I'll accept.
