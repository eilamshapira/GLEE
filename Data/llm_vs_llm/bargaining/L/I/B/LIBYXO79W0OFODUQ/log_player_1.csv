"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair initial offer, but considering inflation will affect my gains in future rounds, I'll propose a slightly higher amount for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this division because it's close to equal while giving me a small advantage, which might be acceptable to Bob. If he refuses, my next opportunity to make an offer will be worth less due to inflation, so this is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept, I'll get $4800 with 5% inflation, so effectively $4560
2. If I reject, I can make another offer next round, but that will be worth even less due to inflation
3. Bob's offer is relatively fair, not too far from 50-50
4. Prolonging negotiations will reduce the value for both of us
5. Bob seems reasonable and might get tougher if I reject

Given these factors, especially the impact of inflation, I'll accept this offer. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk getting less value in future rounds.
