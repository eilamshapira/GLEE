"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think your initial offer was a bit one-sided. Considering the inflation risk, I'm willing to take a slightly larger share to secure my part, but still offer you a substantial amount. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While it's slightly less favorable than my initial proposal, the 10% inflation penalty means waiting longer will reduce the real value of any future gains. Getting $475,000 now is better than risking further rounds of negotiation where the money would be worth even less to me."
