"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. You get a smaller share, but I'll make sure we both get something. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Alice after each round, I'll take that into account for my offer.

For Round 2, the total amount is effectively:
- For me (Bob): $1,000,000 * 0.9 = $900,000
- For Alice: $1,000,000 * 0.95 = $950,000

Considering this, I'll make an offer that splits the original $1,000,000 in a way that seems fair, given the decreasing value.

""alice_gain"": 450000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share to make this worthwhile. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Considering the decreasing value:
- For me (Bob), the money is worth 19% less than the original, so $1,000,000 * 0.81 = $810,000.
- For Alice, the money is worth 9.75% less, so $1,000,000 * 0.9025 = $902,500.

Given this, I'll aim for a split that reflects the diminishing value but still tries to find a middle ground.
