"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split, but slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and you get $45. This is a reasonable split that gives both of us a good portion, and it's better to reach an agreement quickly due to the 20% inflation penalty per round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept, I'll get $40, but due to 20% inflation, it's only worth $32 to me
2. If I reject, we go to next round where I can make an offer, but my gains will be worth another 20% less
3. We might risk losing more value in future rounds due to inflation
4. $32 is significantly less than my initial proposal of $55

However, given the harsh inflation penalty on my side (20% per round), if I reject and we continue, any future gains will be worth even less to me. Even if I propose a higher split next round, 20% less value means I need to get a much higher number to match even this current offer.
