"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's offering me $40 out of the $100, which is less than half. Given that inflation will reduce the value by 20% each round, if I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value will only be $80 in real terms for me.

If I reject and offer a 50-50 split next round, I'd get $40 in real value (50% of $80), which is the same as accepting $40 now. However, Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation.
