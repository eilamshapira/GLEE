"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split, which would give each of us $500,000. This is a fair division that acknowledges we both deserve an equal share of the money."
