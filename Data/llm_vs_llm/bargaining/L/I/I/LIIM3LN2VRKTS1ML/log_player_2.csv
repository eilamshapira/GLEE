"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which appears fair at face value. However, I need to account for the 20% inflation penalty per round.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value will be worth 20% less to me. So even if I got a better percentage in the next round, the absolute value might be lower.

Given the inflation penalty and the risk of extended negotiations reducing the pie for everyone, a fair first-round split seems reasonable.
