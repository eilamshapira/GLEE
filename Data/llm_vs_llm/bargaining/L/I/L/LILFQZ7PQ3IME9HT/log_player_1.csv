"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering inflation, the $100 is now worth slightly less to me. My $60 from the previous round is now effectively worth less.

Here's my decision:

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
