"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I need to consider that when making my decision.

The original amount I would get is $500,000, but due to inflation, it's worth 5% less, so:
$500,000 * 0.95 = $475,000

Considering this, I think I can get a better deal if I wait.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was to split it evenly, I'll try to make a slightly better offer for myself, considering the inflation.

The original amount is $1,000,000, but due to two rounds of inflation, the value for me is:
$1,000,000 * (0.95)^2 = $1,000,000 * 0.9025 = $902,500

And for Bob, the value is:
$1,000,000 * (0.8)^2 = $1,000,000 * 0.64 = $640,000

I'll offer Bob a bit less than half of the original value, considering the inflation.
