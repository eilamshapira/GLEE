"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer that considers both my potential inflation losses and fairness.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a fair split where I get slightly more since I face a 10% inflation penalty per round. If we continue to the next round, the total value decreases for me, so this is mutually beneficial to agree now.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  I understand you're facing inflation, but so am I. Let's turn things around.  How about this split? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to decide whether to accept Bob's offer or continue to the next round.

Given the information:
- Bob offered me $45 and wants $55 for himself
- My inflation rate is 10% per round, so the $45 now is worth more than a potentially larger amount next round
- Bob mentioned he also faces inflation (20% per round according to the message)
- If I reject, we go to round 3 where I can make an offer, but my money will be worth another 10% less

If I reject and we go to round 3, I'll face 20% total inflation, and Bob will face 40% inflation. This gives me some advantage in the next round, but I need to consider the total value.

Let me calculate:
- $45 now at 10% inflation = $45 * 0.9 = $40.5 effective value for me
- If I propose something like $60/$40 in round 3, my share would be $60 * 0.8 = $48 effective value

While I could potentially get more by continuing, there's risk that Bob rejects again, leading to further inflation for both of us.
