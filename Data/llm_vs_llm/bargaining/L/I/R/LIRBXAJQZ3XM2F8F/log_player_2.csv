"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a fair split where I get slightly more since I face a 10% inflation penalty per round. If we continue to the next round, the total value decreases for me, so this is mutually beneficial to agree now. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
