"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to propose a split of $10,000, keeping in mind the declining value of the money for both of us with each round. Since it's Round 1, the inflation hasn't taken a huge toll yet, but I need to be strategic.

Here's my proposal:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   I'm asking for slightly more than half ($5500) to start.
*   Giving Bob $4500 is a significant amount. Hopefully, it's enough to make him accept, considering the diminishing value in future rounds.
*   I want to grab a good share early to make up for the inflation."
