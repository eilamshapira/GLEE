"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it evenly, fair for both 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Alice offers a 50-50 split ($5000 each)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, if I wait:
   * Next round the $5000 would be worth $4750 to me
   * Each subsequent round would reduce value further

A 50-50 split is fair, and waiting would only decrease the value of my share. There's no guarantee Alice would accept a more favorable split next round, and I'd be losing value due to inflation.
