"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to consider the inflation effect on my potential gains. Since I'm going first, I'll try to be somewhat reasonable to increase the chances of Bob accepting.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. The $4500 is now worth 5% less to me. Let's calculate the value:

$4500 * 0.95 = $4275

Now I need to decide if $4275 is worth accepting, or if I should risk another round. Since Bob's amount stays the same, he might offer a lower amount next round. I'll accept this offer.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
