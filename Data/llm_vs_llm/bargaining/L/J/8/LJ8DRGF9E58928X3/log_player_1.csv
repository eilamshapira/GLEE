"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 55/45. It's fair considering the money is losing value for me. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the fact that the money I gain is still worth the same, while Bob's gain is worth 5% less, I think I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer is worth 5% less to him in each round, and I rejected his offer, it's time for me to make a counteroffer. Considering the inflation, I'll make an offer that's slightly more in my favor.

```

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm already losing value. I propose 5250 for me and 4750 for you. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is more reasonable this time, considering the significant loss in value he's experiencing due to inflation. However, I still think I can get a slightly better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was closer to what I was looking for, and considering the inflation is really eating into his share now (14.26% less), I'll make a counteroffer that's still in my favor but not too aggressive.
