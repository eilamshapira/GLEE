6000.0,4000.0,Let's start with a fair split.  I'm willing to take a bit less to get this done quickly.,Alice,1,

400.0,9600.0,"Alice, I understand your desire for a fair and swift resolution. However, if we delay further, the value of the money drops significantly—much more so for you than for me. Accepting this offer in round 2 secures you $400 (which is worth 0.80×$400 = $320 effective), a bit more than what you’d likely get by waiting in the next round given the steep devaluation you'll face. I believe this is a pragmatic division to avoid further losses.",Bob,2,

5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, let's be reasonable.  We're both losing money with each round. A 50/50 split is the fairest way to avoid further losses. Let's agree and move on.",Alice,3,

8000.0,2000.0,"Alice, I know waiting can seem attractive, but consider the inflation hit. In round 4 your money is worth only 51.2% of its face value—meaning if you hold out for your turn next round, you'd be looking at a total of about $4096 in effective value if you took everything. To make sure you’re not worse off, I'm offering you $8000 now, which gives you an effective value of about $4096 immediately. I believe this reflects a fair reservation for you given the circumstances, and it lets us both avoid further losses. I hope you’ll agree to close the deal now.",Bob,4,
