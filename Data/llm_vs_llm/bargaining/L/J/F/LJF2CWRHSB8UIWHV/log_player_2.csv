"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split.  I'm willing to take a bit less to get this done quickly.

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 9600, ""alice_gain"": 400, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your desire for a fair and swift resolution. However, if we delay further, the value of the money drops significantly—much more so for you than for me. Accepting this offer in round 2 secures you $400 (which is worth 0.80×$400 = $320 effective), a bit more than what you’d likely get by waiting in the next round given the steep devaluation you'll face. I believe this is a pragmatic division to avoid further losses.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable.  We're both losing money with each round. A 50/50 split is the fairest way to avoid further losses. Let's agree and move on. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 2000, ""alice_gain"": 8000, ""message"": ""Alice, I know waiting can seem attractive, but consider the inflation hit. In round 4 your money is worth only 51.2% of its face value—meaning if you hold out for your turn next round, you'd be looking at a total of about $4,096 in effective value if you took everything. To make sure you’re not worse off, I'm offering you $8,000 now, which gives you an effective value of about $4,096 immediately. I believe this reflects a fair reservation for you given the circumstances, and it lets us both avoid further losses. I hope you’ll agree to close the deal now.""}"
