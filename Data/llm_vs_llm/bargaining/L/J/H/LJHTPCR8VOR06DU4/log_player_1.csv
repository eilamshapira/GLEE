"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my first offer to Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This gives Bob a substantial portion while acknowledging that I face a higher inflation penalty each round (20% vs. his 10%), so reaching an agreement sooner is particularly beneficial for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new offer that takes into account the increasing inflation pressure.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob more than my initial proposal. Since inflation impacts me more severely (20% vs. 10% for Bob), finding an agreement soon is particularly important for me. This 55-45 split represents a fair middle ground between our previous positions."
