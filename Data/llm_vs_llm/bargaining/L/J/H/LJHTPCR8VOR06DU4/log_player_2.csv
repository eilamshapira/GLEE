"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Alice after each round, I'll take that into account for my offer.

The value of the money for me after 1 round is 10,000 * 0.9 = $9,000
The value of the money for Alice after 1 round is 10,000 * 0.8 = $8,000

Considering this, my offer for round 2 is:
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the value of the money for me after 2 rounds is 10,000 * 0.9 * 0.9 = $8,100
The value of the money for Alice after 2 rounds is 10,000 * 0.8 * 0.8 = $6,400

Alice's offer is $4,500 for me and $5,500 for her. 

Given the decreasing value of the money, I think it's a relatively fair offer, so I'll accept it.
