"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split it so we both get a good amount. This offer gives you a substantial portion while ensuring I also get a fair share. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Alice's offer sounds amicable, it's not the most advantageous for me, Bob. I'm willing to negotiate for a better split in the upcoming rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's make a deal that benefits us both, Alice. This offer gives me a slight edge while still ensuring a good amount for you.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we both want a fair share. This offer gives you a bit more than the previous round, considering the inflation affecting you. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is slightly better this round, but it's still not favorable considering the inflation. I need to push for a larger share while there's still significant value left for me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking, and inflation is eating away at the value. This is a strong offer that ensures a good share for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle, Bob. This is a fair split that ensures neither of us feels shortchanged, especially considering the inflation affecting you. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the most logical choice.  The inflation is significantly impacting my potential gains with each passing round. Accepting now secures a reasonable amount, whereas continuing to reject offers in the hopes of a slightly better deal carries the risk of ending up with nothing."
