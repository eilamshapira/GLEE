"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's do a fair 50-50 split. This way we both benefit equally and avoid further inflation risks. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is fair and ensures we both get a reasonable amount. While I could try for more in later rounds, the 5% inflation makes it too risky. A guaranteed $500,000 now is better than potentially nothing later."
