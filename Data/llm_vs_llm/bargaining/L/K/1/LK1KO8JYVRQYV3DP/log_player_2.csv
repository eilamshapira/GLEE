"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and avoid the risk of inflation. I take a bit more, as I'm taking the first risk. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Alice is offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000 total. If I reject:
- The money will be worth 5% less for me in the next round
- I'll get to make a counter-proposal
- But Alice might reject it, leading to further inflation

$400,000 is a significant amount, but Alice is taking a larger share (60%) while justifying it as ""taking the first risk"" which isn't really a valid reason. I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-proposal, even accounting for the 5% inflation.

With inflation, the money will be worth 95% in the next round, but I can propose a more equitable split.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split, acknowledging that we both face risks from inflation.
