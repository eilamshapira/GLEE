"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. It's a 50-50 split, which is fair
2. If I reject, I'll have to propose next round, but the money will be worth 5% less to me
3. Even with a more favorable split next round, I might lose value due to inflation
4. There's no guarantee Alice would accept a better offer from me

This is a reasonable first offer, and waiting would only decrease the value for me.
