"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a reasonable first offer, considering that Bob has more pressure from inflation than I do. However, I'll still aim for a favorable split for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this split because:
1. It's a fair starting point that gives Bob a significant portion
2. With Bob's higher inflation rate (20% vs my 5%), he has more incentive to accept early
3. The 60-40 split acknowledges both our positions while maintaining my advantage as first mover"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer because:
1. Even with my lower inflation rate (5%), I can still afford to negotiate for a better deal
2. Bob's higher inflation rate (20%) puts more pressure on him in future rounds
3. The proposed 40-60 split in Bob's favor is less favorable than my initial offer, and I believe we can find a more balanced solution"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that we're now in round 3, and both of us have rejected previous offers, I'll adjust my offer to be more appealing while still maintaining a good position for myself. The money is now worth 10% less for me and 40% less for Bob compared to round 1.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split because:
1. It's more favorable to Bob than my first offer, showing willingness to negotiate
2. With Bob's severe inflation penalty (40% loss already), he has strong incentive to accept
3. The 55-45 split is more balanced while still giving me a slight advantage
4. If Bob rejects this, his next counter-offer will be worth significantly less to him due to the 20% per round inflation"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because:
1. The inflation effects are becoming significant, especially for Bob (48.8% loss)
2. This offer (4500 for me) with 14.26% inflation is worth about 3859 in round 1 value
3. If I reject, any future gains will be worth even less
4. The difference between this offer and my last proposal has narrowed, making it a reasonable compromise
5. Further negotiation rounds will erode value for both of us significantly"
