Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I need to consider the actual value I'll get. 
For me, $45 is worth $45 * 0.8 = $36.
Considering this, I don't think it's a good deal.
{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 20% * 2 = 40% less than in the first round (20% less in round 2 and another 20% less in round 3, which is equivalent to 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64). 
So, I'll try to get a bit more to compensate for the loss.
