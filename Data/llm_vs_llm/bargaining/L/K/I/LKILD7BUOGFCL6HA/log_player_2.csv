"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that Alice is proposing I receive $4,000 and she receives $6,000, I need to consider whether to accept or make a counter-offer.

If I reject and move to the next round, the value decreases by 10% for me and 20% for Alice. This means my potential future gains would have to exceed $4,000 to be worthwhile.

Since this is the first round and we have a significant inflation difference (10% vs 20%), I believe I can achieve a better outcome by making a counter-proposal. Alice faces higher inflation pressure than I do, which gives me some leverage in future rounds.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more favorable to me while still being reasonable for Alice to accept given her higher inflation penalty.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I suggest we divide the $10,000 with me receiving $5,500 and you receiving $4,500. This is a fair division considering our different inflation rates - you face 20% depreciation per round compared to my 10%, which means you have more incentive to reach an agreement quickly."
