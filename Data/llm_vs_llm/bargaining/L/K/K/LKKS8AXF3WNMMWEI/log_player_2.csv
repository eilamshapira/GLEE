"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair - I get 60%, you get 40%. If you reject, both of us will lose value due to inflation, and you'll lose more than me. This is a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Current split: $400,000 for me, $600,000 for Alice (40/60 split)

2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make an offer
   * My money will be worth 20% less
   * Her money will be worth 10% less
   * Maximum I could get would be $800,000 (but worth 20% less = $640,000)

3. Considerations:
   * Alice's argument about inflation is valid - I lose more value per round
   * $400,000 now is better than potentially more money that's worth less
   * The offer isn't extremely unfair
   * Risk of further negotiations leading to worse outcomes

Given the asymmetric inflation rates and the decent initial offer, I'll accept.
