"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate this offer carefully.

Alice is offering an even split, where I'd get $5,000 and she'd get $5,000. This is fair and equitable.

If I reject and we go to the next round, inflation will reduce the total value by 5%, meaning we'd only be dividing $9,500 instead of $10,000. Even if I proposed a more favorable split for myself in the next round, the total amount would be less.

A fair split in the first round is economically rational and avoids the risk of continued negotiations reducing our total amount.
