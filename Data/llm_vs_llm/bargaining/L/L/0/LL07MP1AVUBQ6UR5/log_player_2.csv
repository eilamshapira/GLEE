"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we both get a good share. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. With Alice offering a 50-50 split:

1. I would get $5,000 right now
2. If I reject, any future gains will be worth 10% less
3. While I could try to negotiate for more, there's a risk of losing value through inflation
4. A 50-50 split is generally considered fair

Given that inflation will reduce the value of money in future rounds, and this is a reasonable first offer, I'll accept.
