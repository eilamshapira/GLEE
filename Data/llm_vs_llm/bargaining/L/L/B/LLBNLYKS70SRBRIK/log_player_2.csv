"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer which proposes an equal split of 50% for each of us.

Given that:
1. It's a fair and equal division
2. If I reject, we'd move to Round 2 where inflation would reduce the total value by 5%
3. Even if I made a more favorable proposal in Round 2, Alice could reject it, leading to further inflation

The equal split is fair, and accepting now maximizes our collective amount rather than risking value reduction through inflation.
