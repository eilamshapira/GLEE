I'm proposing to take 90% of the money and leave 10% for Bob. It's a good starting point to see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still keeping a majority share. This shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise but not cave to his demands."

Inflation is hitting me hard, but I'm still going to hold out for a decent share. This is my final offer, and if Bob doesn't accept, he'll have to take the risk of the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Inflation is really eating into my share, and I'm not sure I can risk another round. This offer is barely above what I'd get if we continue to the next round, so I'll accept it."
