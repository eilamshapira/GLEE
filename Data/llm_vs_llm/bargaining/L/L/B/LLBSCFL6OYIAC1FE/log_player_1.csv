"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I will make a proposal to Bob, keeping in mind the declining value of the money for both of us. Since this is Round 1 and I'm Alice, I'll start with a relatively generous offer.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this offer.

*   **My Gain:** $5500 (worth the same as in round 1).
*   **Bob's Gain:** $4500 (worth 10% less to him than in round 1).

In round 1, I proposed $6000 for myself. This offer from Bob gives me $5500. Since inflation is not affecting my side yet, this represents a $500 loss from my perspective. However, refusing carries the risk of further declines in future rounds.

I will accept Bob's offer.
