"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Alice proposes: 60/40 split. A fair deal for both of us! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $4,000 of the $10,000
2. If I reject and we move to the next round:
   * The money will be worth 5% less to me
   * The total value for me would be $9,500
   * I would get to make the next proposal
3. Even if I make a better proposal next round, Alice might reject it, leading to further rounds and more value loss

While 40% isn't ideal, getting $4,000 now is better than risking further devaluation through multiple rounds of negotiation. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush.
