"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 1667, ""bob_gain"": 8333, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we settle right now: I take $1,667 and you get $8,333. Since every additional round cuts my share’s value by 20%, I believe this offer reflects our current positions and avoids the cost of delay. I’m looking forward to your thoughts.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your opening offer, but the split wasn't quite fair.  Let's be reasonable - I'll take $7000 and you get $3000. It's a good deal considering the time pressure and inflation working against you. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I accept your division: $3,000 for me (which is worth 20% less this round) and $7,000 for you. Let's finalize this agreement.""}"
