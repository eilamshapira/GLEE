"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we settle right now: I take $1667 and you get $8333. Since every additional round cuts my share’s value by 20%, I believe this offer reflects our current positions and avoids the cost of delay. I’m looking forward to your thoughts. 
# Bob gain: 8333 
# Alice gain: 1667 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your opening offer, but the split wasn't quite fair.  Let's be reasonable - I'll take $7000 and you get $3000. It's a good deal considering the time pressure and inflation working against you.""
