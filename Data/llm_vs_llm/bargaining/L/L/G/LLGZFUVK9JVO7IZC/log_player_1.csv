"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I want to offer a fair and reasonable division of the money. Since we both need to agree to finish the game, I think an equal split makes the most sense.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose we split the million dollars equally - $500,000 each. This is a fair division that respects both of our interests in this game."
