"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept this offer. It's a fair 50-50 split, which is the most equitable solution. There's no reason to risk future rounds where offers might become less favorable, and this split maximizes mutual benefit.
