"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, 55/45 is fair 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $450,000, but it's worth 20% less than the original value. So, the actual value I'll get is 0.8 * $450,000 = $360,000.

If I reject this offer, the money will be worth even less in the next round.
