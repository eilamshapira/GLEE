"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $400,000 while she takes $600,000. 

Given that inflation reduces the value by 10% each round for me, if I reject now and make a counter-offer next round, the total value would only be worth $900,000 to me. If I were to propose a perfect 50-50 split next round, that would be $450,000 each, but with 10% inflation, my $450,000 would actually be worth $405,000 to me - only slightly better than accepting her current offer.

While a 40-60 split isn't perfectly equal, considering the inflation penalty for waiting, it's not a bad offer. Negotiating further could result in diminishing returns for me due to inflation.
