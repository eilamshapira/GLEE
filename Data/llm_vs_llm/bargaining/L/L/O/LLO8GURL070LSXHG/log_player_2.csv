"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Let's see if the next round gives me a better opportunity."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I'm taking a bit more since the value is decreasing for me. You might want to accept this offer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation concern, but I need a fair share too. Let's settle for this. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Even though the value is less for me now, it's still a reasonable offer given the circumstances."
