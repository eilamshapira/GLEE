6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, here's my first proposal: I'll receive $6000 and you'll receive $4000. Given that my share loses 5% of its value each round, it's beneficial for us to conclude the division swiftly. I hope you agree that this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. Looking forward to your response!",Alice,1,

5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your concern about the devaluation. However, I think a fair deal is to split 50:50. Given that my share loses 10% of its value each round, unlike yours 5%, I think that's the way to go.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, thank you for your proposal. Although waiting another round might seem tempting, given the additional devaluation of my share in future rounds, I'm inclined to accept the 50:50 split as you've offered. Looking forward to finalizing our agreement!",Alice,2,accept
