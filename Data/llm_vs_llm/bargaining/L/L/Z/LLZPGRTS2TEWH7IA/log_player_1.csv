"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my first proposal: I'll receive $6000 and you'll receive $4000. Given that my share loses 5% of its value each round, it's beneficial for us to conclude the division swiftly. I hope you agree that this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. Looking forward to your response!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concern about the devaluation. However, I think a fair deal is to split 50:50. Given that my share loses 10% of its value each round, unlike yours 5%, I think that's the way to go. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your proposal. Although waiting another round might seem tempting, given the additional devaluation of my share in future rounds, I'm inclined to accept the 50:50 split as you've offered. Looking forward to finalizing our agreement!""}"
