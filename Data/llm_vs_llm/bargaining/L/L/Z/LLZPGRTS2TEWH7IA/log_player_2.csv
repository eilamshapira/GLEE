"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my first proposal: I'll receive $6000 and you'll receive $4000. Given that my share loses 5% of its value each round, it's beneficial for us to conclude the division swiftly. I hope you agree that this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. Looking forward to your response! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000
