"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first move. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether accepting this offer is better than making a counter-offer, given the 20% inflation each round.

If I accept now, I get $40.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2, even if I propose a more favorable split for myself, the money will be worth 20% less to me. So even if I asked for a 50-50 split next round, I'd only effectively get $40 (50 Ã— 0.8).

Given the inflation penalty and the fact that Alice has offered me a reasonable amount, I'll accept this offer.
