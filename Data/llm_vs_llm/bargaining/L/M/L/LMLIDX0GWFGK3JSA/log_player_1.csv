"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1, designed to be reasonable and encourage Bob to accept:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

Explanation: I'm proposing a split where I get $5500 and Bob gets $4500. This gives me a slight advantage, but still offers Bob a substantial amount, especially considering the declining value of the money over time. I hope he sees this as a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
