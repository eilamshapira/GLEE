Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"":800000,""bob_gain"":200000,""message"":""Let's start with a solid offer for you. How about I take 800k and you get 200k? It's a good amount for both of us!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the impact of inflation, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair given the decreasing value of money each round. Let's settle this now before it devalues further. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
