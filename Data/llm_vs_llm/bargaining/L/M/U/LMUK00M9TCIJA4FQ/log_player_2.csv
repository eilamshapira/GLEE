"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $40 while she gets $60. 

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2, the money will be worth 10% less to me (so $100 would become worth $90), while for Alice the money would only be worth 5% less (so $100 would become worth $95).

This asymmetric inflation means I should be more eager to settle quickly than Alice. However, I still want a fair division.

Let me calculate: If I reject and propose a 50-50 split next round, I'd get $50 but it would be worth only $45 to me due to 10% inflation. Alice would get $50 worth $47.50 to her due to 5% inflation. This is still better for me than accepting $40 now.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Now that I'm making the offer, I need to consider both our positions carefully. The asymmetric inflation means I should be more motivated to reach an agreement quickly than Alice.

I'll propose a more balanced split, but one that acknowledges the inflation pressure I face. Since the money is worth 10% less to me this round but only 5% less to Alice, I need to account for this difference.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'm offering a split where I get $55 and Alice gets $45. This is more balanced than her initial offer and represents a fair compromise. If she rejects this and we go to round 3, both of us would face additional inflation, making a deal now beneficial for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer considering the increasing inflation penalties.

Currently, Alice is offering me $45. With 19% inflation for me, this $45 is actually worth $36.45 to me (45 × 0.81).

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 4, the inflation for me will increase further. My next round would have approximately 27% inflation (compounding the 10% per round), making $100 worth only about $73 to me.

If I were to propose a 50-50 split in round 4, $50 would be worth only about $36.50 to me after inflation (50 × 0.73). This is slightly worse than accepting $45 now (worth $36.45 to me).

Additionally, Alice has improved her offer from the initial $40 to $45, showing willingness to compromise.

Given the asymmetric inflation working against me and the reasonable improvement in Alice's offer, I should accept this deal.
