6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split. This is fair considering the inflation penalty you face. If we delay, your share will be worth less each round.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Alice, I propose a 50-50 split. This way, we both get an equal share, and I can minimize the impact of inflation. Let's be fair and end this game quickly.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6500.0,3500.0,"Bob, considering you face 10% inflation each round while I don't, this 65-35 split is actually fair. If we keep going, inflation will reduce your purchasing power even more. Let's conclude this now to maximize your actual value.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Alice, considering the inflation I'm facing, I think a 45-55 split is reasonable. This way, we both get a fair share, and I can still walk away with a decent amount. Let's settle this quickly.",Bob,4,

7000.0,3000.0,"Bob, let's be practical. Your money is now worth significantly less due to inflation, while mine keeps its value. This 70-30 split actually gives you more real value than what you'd get from a better nominal split after more rounds of inflation. It's in your best interest to accept now.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"Alice, let's settle for a 40-60 split. This way, I can still get a fair share considering the inflation I'm facing. It's important to conclude this soon to minimize further losses for me.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
7500.0,2500.0,"Bob, we're now in round 7 and your money has lost over 40% of its value. With a 75-25 split now, you'll actually get more real value than waiting for future rounds where inflation will continue to erode your share. This is the most practical solution for both of us.",Alice,7,
