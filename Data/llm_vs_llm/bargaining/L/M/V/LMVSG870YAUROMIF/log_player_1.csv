"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split. This is fair considering the inflation penalty you face. If we delay, your share will be worth less each round.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose a 50-50 split. This way, we both get an equal share, and I can minimize the impact of inflation. Let's be fair and end this game quickly. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Rationale (not part of response): I'll reject because Bob faces inflation pressure while I don't. By waiting, I can likely get a better deal since each round makes Bob's position weaker. A 50-50 split doesn't account for this dynamic."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6500, 
""bob_gain"": 3500, 
""message"": ""Bob, considering you face 10% inflation each round while I don't, this 65-35 split is actually fair. If we keep going, inflation will reduce your purchasing power even more. Let's conclude this now to maximize your actual value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the inflation I'm facing, I think a 45-55 split is reasonable. This way, we both get a fair share, and I can still walk away with a decent amount. Let's settle this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Rationale (not part of response): With Bob facing increasing inflation pressure (now at 27.1%), and me having no inflation impact, I can still push for a better deal. Bob's position weakens with each round, while mine stays strong. A 55-45 split is still not reflecting the full advantage of my position."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7000, 
""bob_gain"": 3000, 
""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical. Your money is now worth significantly less due to inflation, while mine keeps its value. This 70-30 split actually gives you more real value than what you'd get from a better nominal split after more rounds of inflation. It's in your best interest to accept now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's settle for a 40-60 split. This way, I can still get a fair share considering the inflation I'm facing. It's important to conclude this soon to minimize further losses for me. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Rationale (not part of response): With Bob's money now worth about 41% less due to inflation, and still 6 rounds remaining, my negotiating position continues to strengthen. Bob's offer of 60-40 doesn't fully reflect the inflation pressure they're under. I can push for a better deal since their position will only weaken further with each passing round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7500, 
""bob_gain"": 2500, 
""message"": ""Bob, we're now in round 7 and your money has lost over 40% of its value. With a 75-25 split now, you'll actually get more real value than waiting for future rounds where inflation will continue to erode your share. This is the most practical solution for both of us.""}"
