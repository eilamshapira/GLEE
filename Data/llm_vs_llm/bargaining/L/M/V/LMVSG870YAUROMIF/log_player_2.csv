# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split. This is fair considering the inflation penalty you face. If we delay, your share will be worth less each round.

# Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but considering the inflation penalty I face, I would like to propose a 50-50 split instead. This way, we both get an equal share, and I can minimize the impact of inflation."

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering you face 10% inflation each round while I don't, this 65-35 split is actually fair. If we keep going, inflation will reduce your purchasing power even more. Let's conclude this now to maximize your actual value.

# Bob's message:

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical. Your money is now worth significantly less due to inflation, while mine keeps its value. This 70-30 split actually gives you more real value than what you'd get from a better nominal split after more rounds of inflation. It's in your best interest to accept now. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000

# Bob's message:
# Alice, I understand your perspective, but I think a 40-60 split is more fair given the inflation I'm facing. This way, we can both walk away with a reasonable share. Let's conclude this now to minimize further losses on my part."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Bob, we're now in round 7 and your money has lost over 40% of its value. With a 75-25 split now, you'll actually get more real value than waiting for future rounds where inflation will continue to erode your share. This is the most practical solution for both of us.
