"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: I get $4000, Alice gets $6000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to inflation:
   - My money will be worth 5% less next round
   - Alice's money will be worth 20% less next round
4. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
   - My $4000 would be worth $3800
   - Alice's $6000 would be worth $4800

Given that Alice's money devalues much faster than mine (20% vs 5%), I have leverage in negotiations. If I reject, I can likely get a better deal next round since Alice will be more motivated to avoid further devaluation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice's money devalues much faster than mine (20% vs 5% per round), I'll propose a more favorable split for me, but still reasonable enough that she should accept rather than risk another round of heavy devaluation.

For Alice, waiting another round would mean her money is worth 20% less, so she should be motivated to accept a fair offer now.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split because:
1. It's better for me than her initial offer
2. For Alice, $4500 now is better than potentially less in the next round after 20% devaluation
3. It's not so extreme that it would appear unfair or vindictive"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Current offer: $4200 for me, $5800 for Alice
2. Due to current inflation:
   - My $4200 is actually worth $3790.50 (9.75% less)
   - Alice's $5800 is worth only $3712 (36% less)
3. If I reject and we go to next round:
   - My money will devalue another 5%
   - Alice's money will devalue another 20%
   - Total devaluation will be 14.75% for me and 56% for Alice

Alice's offer is only slightly better than her first offer ($4200 vs $4000), despite her money having devalued significantly. Given the severe devaluation rate for Alice, I can likely get a better deal by rejecting and making a counter-offer next round, as she'll be under more pressure to accept.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given the current situation:

1. Alice's money has already devalued by 36%
2. If she rejects this offer, her next round will see a 56% total devaluation
3. My money has only devalued by 9.75%, and will be at 14.75% if we go another round

I can now propose a more aggressive split in my favor, as Alice should be highly motivated to avoid another round of severe devaluation.

{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500}

This split is strategic because:
1. For Alice, $3500 now is worth more than a larger number that would be devalued by 56% in the next round
2. The increasing difference in our devaluation rates (5% vs 20% per round) strengthens my negotiating position
3. It's a significant improvement for me over previous offers while still leaving Alice with a meaningful amount"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Current offer:
   - My $4400 is actually worth $3585.80 (after 18.55% devaluation)
   - Alice's $5600 is worth only $2293.76 (after 59.04% devaluation)
2. If I reject and we go to next round:
   - My devaluation will increase by another 5% (to 23.55%)
   - Alice's devaluation will increase by another 20% (to 79.04%)
   - The money will be worth dramatically less for both of us

Looking at the rapid devaluation and diminishing returns:
- We've gone through several rounds of negotiation
- Both of us are losing significant value
- The next round would make any gains nearly worthless for Alice
- My current offer of $4400, while not ideal, is still worth more than a potentially larger amount in the next round

Given the severe devaluation we're both facing, it's becoming a lose-lose situation. It's better to accept now than risk further value loss.
