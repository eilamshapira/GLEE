"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly at 50-50 to keep things fair for both of us! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Due to 20% inflation on my side, if I accept the $50 now, it's effectively worth $40 to me
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount I get will be worth even less (another 20% reduction)
3. Even if I propose a higher split in my favor next round, Bob might reject again, leading to further losses

Given the significant inflation penalty I face and the risk of further devaluation, I should accept this fair offer now rather than risk getting less value in future rounds.
