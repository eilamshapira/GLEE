"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:**  The value of the money is decreasing for me each round. It's crucial to secure a reasonable amount sooner rather than later.
* **Bob's Position:** Bob rejected my initial offer, indicating he likely desires at least $5000. 
* **Strategic Compromise:** Offering $5500 for myself is a slight decrease from my previous offer, but still a better outcome than accepting Bob's $5000 offer in the previous round, especially considering inflation. This offer might be tempting enough for Bob to accept, as it represents a gain from his perspective."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice given the circumstances:

* **Severe Inflation:** The value of the money has significantly decreased for me. Continuing to hold out risks even further losses in real terms. 
* **Downward Trend:** Bob's offers have consistently favored him more with each round.  It's unlikely he'll offer anything better than this in the future.
* **Certainty vs. Risk:** Accepting this offer provides a guaranteed, albeit diminished, payout. Rejecting it risks getting an even worse deal in later rounds due to the accelerating inflation."
