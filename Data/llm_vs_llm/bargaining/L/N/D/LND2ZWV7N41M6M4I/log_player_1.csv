"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that each round reduces the value by 20% for me, I should make a reasonable first offer that Bob might accept. A fair split would increase the chances of acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split because while it gives me a slight advantage, it's not so uneven that Bob would definitely reject it. If he does reject it and we go to the next round, my potential gain would already be worth 20% less to me, so there's an incentive to reach an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Bob is offering me $6000, but due to 20% inflation, it's actually worth $4800 to me
2. This is less than what I could have gotten in round 1 ($5500)
3. If I reject, I'll face another 20% inflation in the next round
4. We still have 10 rounds left, but each delay makes the money worth less to me
5. $4800 in real value is still a decent amount, and better than risking further depreciation
