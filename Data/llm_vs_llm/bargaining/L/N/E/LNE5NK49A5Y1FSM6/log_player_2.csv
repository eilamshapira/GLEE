"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

The offer gives me $4,500 out of $10,000. That's 45% of the total.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me. So my $4,500 now would only be worth $3,600 in the next round, and Alice's money would be worth 10% less to her.

While the split isn't exactly 50-50, getting $4,500 now is better than risking further devaluation through negotiation. It's a reasonable first offer.
