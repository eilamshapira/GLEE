"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to avoid inflation eating into our gains.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's aim for a more balanced split to ensure we both benefit. I propose $4500 for me and $5500 for you. This way, we counteract some inflation loss together. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
* If I accept now, I'll get $5500, but it's worth 10% less due to inflation, so effectively $4950
* If I reject and we go to next round, any amount will be worth even less (20% less than original)
* First round I offered myself $6000, which if accepted would have been worth $6000
* Bob's current offer of $5500 (worth $4950 to me) is fairly reasonable given the inflation penalty
* Waiting another round would likely lead to even worse outcomes due to compounding inflation
