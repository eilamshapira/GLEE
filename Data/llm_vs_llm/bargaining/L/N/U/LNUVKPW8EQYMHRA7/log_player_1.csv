"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll approach this strategically, considering the inflation effect and the need to reach a fair agreement with Bob.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a fair split where I get $55 and you get $45. Since inflation affects my earnings by 5% each round, it's beneficial for both of us to accept early offers. If we move to another round, we both risk losing value.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair.  I'm offering you $40, and I'll take $60. It's a better deal for both of us than last round, and we can avoid further risk from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll adjust my strategy based on the current situation and the inflation effect.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48,
  ""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you $48 which is better than my previous offer. With inflation reducing my value by 5% each round, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement now. This is a fair compromise considering the time pressure I'm under due to inflation. Let's conclude this deal and both walk away satisfied.""
