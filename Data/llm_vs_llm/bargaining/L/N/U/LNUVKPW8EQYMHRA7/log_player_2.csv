"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a fair split where I get $55 and you get $45. Since inflation affects my earnings by 5% each round, it's beneficial for both of us to accept early offers. If we move to another round, we both risk losing value. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair.  I'm offering you $40, and I'll take $60. It's a better deal for both of us than last round, and we can avoid further risk from inflation."" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you $48 which is better than my previous offer. With inflation reducing my value by 5% each round, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement now. This is a fair compromise considering the time pressure I'm under due to inflation. Let's conclude this deal and both walk away satisfied. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
