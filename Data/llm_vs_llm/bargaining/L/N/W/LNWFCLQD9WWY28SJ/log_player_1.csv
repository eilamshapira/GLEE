"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

This is a reasonable first offer that gives me a small advantage while still being attractive enough for Bob to consider accepting. If he rejects, the next round's money will be worth 10% less to me, so I'm incentivized to make a fair offer now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept, I'll get $450,000, but due to 10% inflation, it's only worth $405,000 to me
2. If I reject, I can make another offer next round, but any money I get will be worth another 10% less
3. We still have 10 rounds left, but my bargaining power decreases with each round due to inflation
4. Bob's offer is not terrible - it's basically reversing my initial proposal

While I could reject and try to negotiate for more, the inflation penalty makes it risky to drag this out too long. The current offer gives me a decent amount that's only slightly degraded by inflation.
