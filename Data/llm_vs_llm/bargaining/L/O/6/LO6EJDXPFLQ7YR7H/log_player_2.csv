"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether to accept or reject Alice's offer.

Alice is offering me $100,000 out of the $1,000,000 total, which means she would get $900,000. This is only 10% of the total amount for me.

If I reject this offer, we'll proceed to the next round where I'll be able to make a counter-proposal. Since we're dividing a fixed amount and there's no mention of decreasing value over time, I think I can propose a more equitable split.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I believe a 50-50 split is fair for both of us. This way, we both get an equal share of the $1,000,000, which is $500,000 each."
