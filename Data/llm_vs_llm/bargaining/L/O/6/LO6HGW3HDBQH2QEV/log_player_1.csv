"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering I made the first move and took initiative in starting our negotiation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation affecting my share, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This accounts for the value loss since the last round and still offers you a significant portion. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Bob offers me $45, which still holds full value for me
2. Bob wants $55, but due to 10% inflation, it's actually worth $49.5 to him
3. If I reject and we go to next round, Bob's share will be worth even less due to inflation
4. This offer is reasonable given the circumstances, and continuing might lead to diminishing total value
