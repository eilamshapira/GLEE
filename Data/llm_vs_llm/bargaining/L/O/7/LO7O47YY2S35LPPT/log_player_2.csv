"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider the offer carefully. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100, which means she's taking $60. If I reject, we go to the next round where I can make a counter-offer, but the money will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation.

Given that:
- This is round 1 of potentially 12 rounds
- Each rejection means the final amount will be worth 5% less to me
- I don't know how inflation affects Alice
- If we reach round 12 without agreement, we both get nothing

The $40 now is better than potentially getting nothing, but I believe I can make a more balanced counter-offer in round 2.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a more balanced offer that acknowledges the inflation risk for both of us.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I propose we split the money equally - $50 for each of us. This is a fair division that maximizes our collective benefit. Since we both face the risk of getting nothing if we don't agree by round 12, and the value is decreasing with each round due to inflation, an equal split now would be beneficial for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice Alice has improved her offer to me by $5, now offering me $45 instead of $40. I also learned some important information - inflation affects Alice more severely than it affects me (19% for her vs. 9.75% for me per round).

Given that:
- This is round 3, so we've used 2 of our 12 rounds
- Alice is now facing higher inflation pressure than I am
- Her offer has improved, showing willingness to compromise
- With time, Alice's position weakens faster than mine due to higher inflation
- However, we both risk getting nothing if we don't agree

Since Alice is facing higher inflation, I could potentially get a better deal by waiting. However, her current offer is already better, and continuing the negotiation has risks for both of us.
