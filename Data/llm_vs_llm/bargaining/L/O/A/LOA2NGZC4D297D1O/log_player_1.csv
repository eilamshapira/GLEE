"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll send my offer to divide the $1,000,000. Since I'm Alice and I'm making the first proposal, I need to consider both our incentives and the inflation rates.

Given that my money loses 5% value per round while Bob's loses 20% per round, Bob has a stronger incentive to accept earlier offers. I should offer a fair division that acknowledges this dynamic.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose that I receive $600,000 and you receive $400,000. This is a reasonable split given our different inflation rates, and I hope you'll find it acceptable so we can both walk away with substantial value rather than risk further depreciation."
