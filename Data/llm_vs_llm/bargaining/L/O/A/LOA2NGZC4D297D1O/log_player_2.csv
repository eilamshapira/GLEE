"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $400,000 (40%) and keeping $600,000 (60%)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, for me the money will be worth 20% less next round
4. $400,000 now vs. potential for more but at 20% discount...
5. $400,000 now is better than $500,000 next round (which would be worth $400,000 to me)

Given the high inflation rate for my side (20%) and the reasonable initial offer, I should accept. Getting 40% of the pot right away is better than risking further devaluation.
