4000.0,6000.0,"Hi Bob, to avoid the risk of inflation eating away my share in future rounds, I'm proposing that we settle now. I suggest you receive $6000 and I take $4000. This deal gives you a slightly larger, immediate gain while ensuring we both get a fair share without any delay. Looking forward to your acceptance!",Alice,1,
