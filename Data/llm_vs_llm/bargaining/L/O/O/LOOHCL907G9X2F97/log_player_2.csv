"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to avoid the risk of inflation eating away my share in future rounds, I'm proposing that we settle now. I suggest you receive $6000 and I take $4000. This deal gives you a slightly larger, immediate gain while ensuring we both get a fair share without any delay. Looking forward to your acceptance! 
# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:

1. She's offering me $6000 (60%) and taking $4000 (40%)
2. This is better than a 50-50 split
3. If I reject, the money will be worth 10% less next round for me
4. By accepting now, I avoid any inflation loss
5. It's a generous first offer that gives me the majority share

Given these factors, especially that I'm getting more than half and avoiding any inflation loss, this is a good deal for me.
