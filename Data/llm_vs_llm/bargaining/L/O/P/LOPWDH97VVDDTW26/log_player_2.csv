"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 16.67 
# Alice gain: 83.33 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each round, I'll make a reasonable offer. 

{""bob_gain"": 60, 
""alice_gain"": 40}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 70 
# Alice gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value I'd get is 70 * 0.64 (since 20% less in round 1 and another 20% less in round 2, which is 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64) = 44.8. 

However, this is still a significant amount, and Alice's offer seems more reasonable this time.
