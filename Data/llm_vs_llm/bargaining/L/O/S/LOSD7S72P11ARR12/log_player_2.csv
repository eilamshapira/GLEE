"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a counter-offer in the next round. Alice's offer is too unbalanced, giving her 90% of the money while I only get 10%. Even with the 5% inflation penalty, I can propose a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I propose a fair 50-50 split of the money. This way, we both get $5,000, which is much more equitable than the previous 90-10 split. Even with the 5% reduction in value from round 1, we would both still get $4,750 each, which is significantly better for me and still good for Alice."
