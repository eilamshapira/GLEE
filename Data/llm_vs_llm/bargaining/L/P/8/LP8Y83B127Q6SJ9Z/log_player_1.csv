"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair offer that benefits both of us, considering the inflation penalty for further rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50}

I suggest an equal split of the $100, giving us each $50. This is fair and allows us both to maximize our gains rather than risk the 20% inflation penalty in future rounds."
