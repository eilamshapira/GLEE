"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split while considering the inflation risk for me. If Bob rejects, the money will be worth 20% less for me in the next round.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because it's slightly in my favor but still reasonable enough that Bob might accept it. If he rejects, I'll lose value due to inflation, so I want to make an attractive offer while ensuring I get a good portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept, I'll get $525,000, but due to 20% inflation, it's actually worth $420,000 to me (525000 * 0.8)
2. If I reject, in the next round I can make a new offer, but the money will be worth even less (another 20% less)
3. Bob's current offer is reasonable considering the inflation effects
4. If I reject, I risk getting an even worse deal in future rounds due to compounding inflation

Given these factors, especially the harsh inflation penalty I face, it's better to accept this offer now rather than risk further value loss.
