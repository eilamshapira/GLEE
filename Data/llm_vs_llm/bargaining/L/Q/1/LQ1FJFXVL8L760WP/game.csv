5500.0,4500.0,"I propose we split the money with me getting 5500 and you getting 4500. This way, we both get a fair share considering the inflation affects me more.",Alice,1,

3103.0,6897.0,"Alice, considering our respective inflation rates, waiting only diminishes our total gains. Based on the equilibrium outcome if we continued, this split—where I receive $6897 and you $3103—ensures you receive what you’d expect by proposing next round. Accepting now is mutually beneficial, so let's settle and avoid further loss.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
4255.0,5745.0,"Given the inflation, I propose we split the money with me getting 4255 and you getting 5745. This considers the devaluation and ensures we both get a reasonable share.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
3103.0,6897.0,"Alice, if we delay further, both our shares plummet due to inflation. In the next round, you would have the privilege of proposing but would only secure what amounts to an effective value equivalent to receiving $3103 nominally. To avoid further losses in value for both of us, I'm offering the same equilibrium split now: I receive $6897 and you receive $3103. Please accept this offer so we can both secure the best possible outcome under these devaluing conditions.",Bob,4,
