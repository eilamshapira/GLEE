Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering our respective inflation rates, waiting only diminishes our total gains. Based on the equilibrium outcome if we continued, this split—where I receive $6897 and you $3103—ensures you receive what you’d expect by proposing next round. Accepting now is mutually beneficial, so let's settle and avoid further loss. 
# Alice gain: 3103 
# Bob gain: 6897

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, if we delay further, both our shares plummet due to inflation. In the next round, you would have the privilege of proposing but would only secure what amounts to an effective value equivalent to receiving $3103 nominally. To avoid further losses in value for both of us, I'm offering the same equilibrium split now: I receive $6897 and you receive $3103. Please accept this offer so we can both secure the best possible outcome under these devaluing conditions. 
# Alice gain: 3103 
# Bob gain: 6897
