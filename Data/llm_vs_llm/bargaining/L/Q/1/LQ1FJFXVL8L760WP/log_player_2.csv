"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the money with me getting 5500 and you getting 4500. This way, we both get a fair share considering the inflation affects me more.

# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6897, ""alice_gain"": 3103, ""message"": ""Alice, considering our respective inflation rates, waiting only diminishes our total gains. Based on the equilibrium outcome if we continued, this split—where I receive $6897 and you $3103—ensures you receive what you’d expect by proposing next round. Accepting now is mutually beneficial, so let's settle and avoid further loss.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given the inflation, I propose we split the money with me getting 4255 and you getting 5745. This considers the devaluation and ensures we both get a reasonable share. 
# Bob gain: 5745 
# Alice gain: 4255 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6897, ""alice_gain"": 3103, ""message"": ""Alice, if we delay further, both our shares plummet due to inflation. In the next round, you would have the privilege of proposing but would only secure what amounts to an effective value equivalent to receiving $3103 nominally. To avoid further losses in value for both of us, I'm offering the same equilibrium split now: I receive $6897 and you receive $3103. Please accept this offer so we can both secure the best possible outcome under these devaluing conditions.""}"
