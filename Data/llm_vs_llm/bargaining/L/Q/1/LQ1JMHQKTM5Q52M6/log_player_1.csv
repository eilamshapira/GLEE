"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering that any delay will reduce the money's value for both of us due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 52-48 split in my favor. Considering the inflation, it's better to settle quickly. This offer is fair and benefits both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Due to 20% inflation for me, if I accept:
   * I'll get $4800, but it's worth only 80% of its original value
   * Real value for me = $4800 * 0.8 = $3840

2. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round:
   * The money will be worth even less (another 20% drop)
   * Even if I get a larger share, it might be worth less in real terms
   * Bob might reject again, leading to further losses

3. Bob's offer is relatively fair (52-48 split)
   * Given the asymmetric inflation (20% for me vs 5% for Bob)
   * Further negotiation might lead to worse outcomes for me
