Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose an equal split of $500000 each. This is fair, and considering that future rounds will decrease the value more for you (20% per round) than for me (10% per round), this is actually better for you than waiting for future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
