"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: A fair split, let's agree now! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if this offer is fair given the inflation rates for both of us.

Alice is offering me $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for herself. If I reject, we'll go to another round where I can make a proposal, but the total amount will be worth less due to inflation (10% less valuable to me, 20% less valuable to Alice).

This means if we go to the next round, the $1,000,000 will effectively be worth $900,000 to me and $800,000 to Alice. This gives me some negotiating power in the next round because Alice has a higher inflation rate.

Given that I could potentially get a better deal in the next round, and Alice would be more motivated to accept due to her higher inflation rate, I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced division that accounts for the inflation rates and gives us both an incentive to agree now.

{""bob_gain"": 500000,

""message"": ""I propose an equal split of $500,000 each. This is fair, and considering that future rounds will decrease the value more for you (20% per round) than for me (10% per round), this is actually better for you than waiting for future rounds.""}"
