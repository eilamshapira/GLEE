69.0,31.0,"Hi Bob, I’m proposing the following split: I receive $69 and you receive $31. Given that each additional round reduces the value of the money—5% for me and 10% for you—I believe this division fairly reflects our future prospects. I think it’s best to settle now rather than watch the pie shrink further. What do you say?",Alice,1,
