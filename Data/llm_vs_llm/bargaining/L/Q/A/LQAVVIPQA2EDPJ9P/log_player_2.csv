"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m proposing the following split: I receive $69 and you receive $31. Given that each additional round reduces the value of the money—5% for me and 10% for you—I believe this division fairly reflects our future prospects. I think it’s best to settle now rather than watch the pie shrink further. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 31 
# Alice gain: 69 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's offer considering the higher inflation penalty I face compared to her.

If I reject and we go to another round, the total amount remains $100, but it's worth 10% less to me and 5% less to Alice. 

If I make a counter-offer that Alice accepts, the maximum I could reasonably get is around $50-55 (since a 50/50 split would give her $50, which after 5% inflation would be worth $47.50 to her).

However, if she rejects my counter-offer, we'd go to a third round where the money would be worth even less to both of us, putting me at a further disadvantage.

Alice's current offer gives me $31, which is better than potentially getting $0 if negotiations break down. Given the asymmetric inflation penalties, this isn't as unfair as it initially appears.
