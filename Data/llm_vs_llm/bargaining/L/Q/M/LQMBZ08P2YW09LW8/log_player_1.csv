"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to be strategic here, considering the inflation factor and the fact that Bob doesn't face inflation. It's fair to account for this asymmetry in my initial offer.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I believe this is a fair starting offer. I'm taking slightly more than half to account for the 20% inflation I face each round, while still giving Bob a substantial portion. This way we can hopefully reach an agreement quickly, which benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'm getting less than my initial proposal, the 20% inflation penalty means waiting longer will reduce my effective gain. Taking $45 now is better than potentially getting less value in future rounds due to increasing inflation that only affects me. This is a reasonable compromise that allows us both to walk away with a fair amount."
