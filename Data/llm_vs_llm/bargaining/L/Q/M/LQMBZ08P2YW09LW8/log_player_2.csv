"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice has proposed that I get $45 and she gets $55 out of the $100.

If I reject, I'll make a counter-offer in the next round, but the money will be worth 20% less to Alice (though still the same to me). This gives me some leverage.

Since this is only round 1 of a potential 12 rounds, and I don't face inflation penalties, I can afford to negotiate for a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's first offer, I'll now make a counter-offer. I need to consider that:
1) The money is worth 20% less to Alice each round
2) I don't face any inflation penalty
3) We have 10 more rounds remaining after this one

Alice's first offer was $45 for me and $55 for her. Since the money is now worth 20% less to her, I can use this advantage but still be fair.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I think this is a reasonable counter-offer that flips our positions from the first round. Since Alice faces time pressure due to her inflation penalty, this gives her incentive to accept while improving my position."
