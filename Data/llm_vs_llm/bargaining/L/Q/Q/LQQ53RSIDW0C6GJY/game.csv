550000.0,450000.0,I suggest a fair split where I get slightly more to account for the inflation risk I face. This way we both walk away with a substantial amount.,Alice,1,

500000.0,500000.0,"Let's keep it simple and split the money equally, so we both get a fair share without worrying about inflation or anything else.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Due to the 10% inflation penalty I face each round, I need a larger share to achieve fair value. My 600k will be worth 540k to me after inflation, while your 400k maintains full value. This makes it more equitable in real terms.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
525000.0,475000.0,"Given the inflation impact on you, I'm offering a split that gives you a bit more while still being fair. Let's reach a deal quickly to avoid further losses.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
650000.0,350000.0,"After 4 rounds, my share is now worth 32.1% less due to inflation. Even with this 650k-350k split, I'd only receive about 441k in real value while you get 350k at full value. This is actually quite fair given the circumstances, and we should agree soon before inflation erodes value further.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Understanding the inflation impact on your side, I'm proposing a 450k-550k split. Let's agree on this to avoid further losses for both of us.",Bob,6,
