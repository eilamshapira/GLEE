"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I suggest a fair split where I get slightly more to account for the inflation risk I face. This way we both walk away with a substantial amount.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's keep it simple and split the money equally, so we both get a fair share without worrying about inflation or anything else. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Reasoning (not part of message): Due to 10% inflation on my side, a 500k-500k split would actually be worth only 450k to me while being worth 500k to Bob. Since I can make another offer and inflation is only affecting my portion, I should try to negotiate for a better split to compensate for this disadvantage."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Due to the 10% inflation penalty I face each round, I need a larger share to achieve fair value. My 600k will be worth 540k to me after inflation, while your 400k maintains full value. This makes it more equitable in real terms.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the inflation impact on you, I'm offering a split that gives you a bit more while still being fair. Let's reach a deal quickly to avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Reasoning (not part of message): With 27.1% inflation, my 525k would only be worth about 382.7k to me, while Bob's 475k maintains full value. This is still not a fair split given the inflation penalty I'm facing. I should counter with another offer that better accounts for the growing inflation impact."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""After 4 rounds, my share is now worth 32.1% less due to inflation. Even with this 650k-350k split, I'd only receive about 441k in real value while you get 350k at full value. This is actually quite fair given the circumstances, and we should agree soon before inflation erodes value further.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Understanding the inflation impact on your side, I'm proposing a 450k-550k split. Let's agree on this to avoid further losses for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Reasoning (not part of message): With 40.95% inflation, my 550k would be worth about 325k in real value, while Bob gets 450k at full value. While this isn't ideal, the inflation penalty is becoming severe, and waiting longer will only make my position worse. It's better to accept this offer now than risk further rounds where my negotiating position would continue to deteriorate due to increasing inflation."
