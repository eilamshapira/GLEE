Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Due to the 10% inflation penalty I face each round, I need a larger share to achieve fair value. My 600k will be worth 540k to me after inflation, while your 400k maintains full value. This makes it more equitable in real terms.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: After 4 rounds, my share is now worth 32.1% less due to inflation. Even with this 650k-350k split, I'd only receive about 441k in real value while you get 350k at full value. This is actually quite fair given the circumstances, and we should agree soon before inflation erodes value further.
