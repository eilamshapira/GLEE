"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. Since I'm Bob in this game, I need to consider the offer carefully.

Alice is offering me $40 while taking $60 for herself. This is less than half the total amount, but I need to factor in the inflation penalty:
- If I reject and make a counter-offer, the money becomes worth 20% less to me in the next round
- For Alice, the money is only worth 10% less per round

If I reject now, the total value will decline, and we'll have fewer rounds to reach agreement. Given the asymmetric inflation rates that disadvantage me more than Alice, I should be more willing to accept a reasonable offer early.

While $40 is less than an equal split, it's not dramatically unfair, and the inflation penalty makes waiting costly for me.
