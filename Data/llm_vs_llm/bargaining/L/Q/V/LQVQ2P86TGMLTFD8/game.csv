40.0,60.0,"Let's start with a fair division. I'll take 40$, and you can have 60$. What do you think?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
1.0,99.0,"Alice, remember that with every round you lose 20% of the money’s real value. By rejecting any offer now, you'll suffer a much harsher discount later. This division gives you something rather than nothing. Accept this offer and lock in your share before further devaluation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
20.0,80.0,"I understand the stakes. How about a division where I take 20$ and you take 80$? This way, we both get something instead of risking it all!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
10.0,90.0,"Alice, delaying the agreement further only hurts your share due to inflation. Right now, even though your $10 is discounted, if you wait until the next round, you'll face an even harsher devaluation. Accept this offer now to secure a guaranteed payout rather than risk losing more value.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5.0,95.0,"I realize time is running out. How about I take 5$ and you take 95$? It’s low, but it’s better than nothing as we risk losing it all!",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
8.0,92.0,"Alice, notice that the inflation is biting hard—every extra round slashes the real value of your share. By accepting this offer now, you'll pocket $8 (which, under current conditions, is worth significantly more than what you'd risk losing by delaying further). I’m offering you as much as I can while still locking in a deal that protects us both from further devaluation. Let's settle now before it gets even worse.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
2.0,98.0,"Recognizing the urgency, I'm proposing that I take 2$ and you take 98$. It’s small, but it ensures I get something instead of risking losing it all. Let's make a deal!",Alice,7,
