Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"":40,""bob_gain"":60,""message"":""Let's start with a fair division. I'll take 40$, and you can have 60$. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, remember that with every round you lose 20% of the money’s real value. By rejecting any offer now, you'll suffer a much harsher discount later. This division gives you something rather than nothing. Accept this offer and lock in your share before further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"":20,""bob_gain"":80,""message"":""I understand the stakes. How about a division where I take 20$ and you take 80$? This way, we both get something instead of risking it all!""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, delaying the agreement further only hurts your share due to inflation. Right now, even though your $10 is discounted, if you wait until the next round, you'll face an even harsher devaluation. Accept this offer now to secure a guaranteed payout rather than risk losing more value.

# Bob gain: 90

Round 5

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, notice that the inflation is biting hard—every extra round slashes the real value of your share. By accepting this offer now, you'll pocket $8 (which, under current conditions, is worth significantly more than what you'd risk losing by delaying further). I’m offering you as much as I can while still locking in a deal that protects us both from further devaluation. Let's settle now before it gets even worse. 
# Alice gain: 8 
# Bob gain: 92

Round 7
