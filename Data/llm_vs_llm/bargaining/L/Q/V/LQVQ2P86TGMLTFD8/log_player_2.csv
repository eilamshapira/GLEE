Round 2

# Alice gain: 20

Round 4

By accepting this offer now, you'll pocket $8 (which, under current conditions, is worth significantly more than what you'd risk losing by delaying further). I’m offering you as much as I can while still locking in a deal that protects us both from further devaluation. Let's settle now before it gets even worse.""}"
