"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer. She's proposing an even 50-50 split of the $10,000, giving us each $5,000.

Since inflation affects Alice but not me, I should consider that time works in my favor. If we go to the next round, the $10,000 remains worth $10,000 to me, but it would be worth 20% less to Alice. This gives me negotiating leverage in later rounds.

I can make a counter-offer in the next round that could be more favorable to me while still being rational for Alice to accept given her time pressure.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer that accounts for the inflation pressure Alice faces while still being reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

I'm proposing that I receive $6,000 and Alice receives $4,000. This is a fair offer considering that if Alice rejects it, the money will be worth 20% less to her in the next round, which means her $4,000 now is comparable to $5,000 in the previous round from her perspective."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer where I get $5,500 and she gets $4,500.

The inflation effect is growing for Alice - the money is now worth 36% less to her than in the first round, while it maintains full value for me. This means Alice is under increasing pressure to reach an agreement.

Her offer is more favorable to me than her initial 50-50 split, but still gives her a substantial portion. Given that I can make another counter-offer in the next round where her inflation penalty will increase to 49%, I could potentially negotiate an even better deal for myself.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer that takes into account Alice's increasing inflation pressure while still being reasonable enough that she should consider accepting it.

{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500}

I'm proposing that I receive $6,500 and Alice receives $3,500. This is a strategic offer considering that if Alice rejects it, the money will be worth approximately 49% less to her in the next round. The decreasing value of money for Alice makes this offer relatively more attractive for her than waiting further rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer where I get $6,000 and she gets $4,000.

The inflation effect has significantly increased for Alice - the money is now worth 59.04% less to her than in the first round, while it maintains full value for me. This means Alice is under substantial pressure to reach an agreement.

Her offer gives me 60% of the total, which is better than her previous offers. However, given the strong inflation pressure she faces, I could likely negotiate an even better deal in the next round. If we continue to round 6, her money will be worth about 67% less than the original value.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given Alice's increasing inflation pressure and our progression through the rounds, I'll make an offer that reflects this dynamic while still giving her incentive to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000}

I'm proposing that I receive $7,000 and Alice receives $3,000. At this point, Alice's money has already lost 59.04% of its value and will lose even more in the next round. This offer gives her $3,000 now, which is worth more to her than potentially getting a slightly larger amount in future rounds when inflation will have reduced its value even further. This is a strategic offer that acknowledges the time pressure she faces while maximizing my position."
