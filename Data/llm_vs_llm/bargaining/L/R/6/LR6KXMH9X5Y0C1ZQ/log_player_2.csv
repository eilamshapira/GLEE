"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
* Alice is offering me $40 out of $100
* If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
* However, due to 10% inflation, the total pot will only be worth $90 in the next round
* My $40 share now would be worth more than a larger share of a smaller pot later

While it's not a completely equal split, it's a reasonable offer and the inflation penalty makes negotiating further potentially costly for both of us.
