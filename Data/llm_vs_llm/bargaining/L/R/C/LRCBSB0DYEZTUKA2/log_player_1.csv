"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $600,000 and giving Bob $400,000, with a message suggesting that this is a fair starting point. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's go with a 55/45 split this round. Still fair for both of us! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I need to consider that when evaluating Bob's offer.

Bob's offer gives me $450,000, but due to the 10% inflation, the value of the money I receive is effectively $450,000 * 0.9 = $405,000.

Considering this, I think I can do better than that. I'll reject Bob's offer and wait for the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Due to the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 20% less than the original value (10% less in Round 1 and another 10% less in Round 2).

To calculate the effective value, I'll consider the inflation: $1,000,000 * 0.8 = $800,000 (for me).

For Bob, the money is worth 10% less than the original value (5% less in Round 1 and another 5% less in Round 2): $1,000,000 * 0.9 = $900,000 (for Bob, but I don't know this, I'm just assuming his inflation rate is different).

I'll make an offer that takes into account the reduced value for me. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 52/48 split this time!""
}
```

I'm offering a 52/48 split, hoping Bob will accept. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: How about a 52/48 split in my favor this time? We're getting closer to an agreement! 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Now, considering the inflation, the money I gain is worth 30% less than the original value (10% less in Round 1, 10% less in Round 2, and 10% less in Round 3, but since it's cumulative, it's 10% + 10% * 0.9 + 10% * 0.9 * 0.9 = 27.1% less).

So, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $480,000, but its effective value is $480,000 * (1 - 0.271) = $480,000 * 0.729 = $349,920.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I need to consider the alternative: going to the next round and risking even more inflation.

I think I'll accept this offer, as it's better than potentially getting an even worse deal in the next round.
