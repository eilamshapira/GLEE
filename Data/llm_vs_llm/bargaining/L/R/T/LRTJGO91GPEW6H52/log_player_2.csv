"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose an even split of $100 – $50 for each of us. I believe this is fair and avoids the 5% devaluation on my end if we delay further. Let’s agree now for the benefit of both. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Current offer is $50 for me
2. If I reject, in the next round:
   * The money will be worth 20% less for me
   * Maximum I could propose would be $100, but would only be worth $80 to me
   * Alice might reject my offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation

The $50 offer is fair and accepting now avoids the risk of inflation reducing my gains. While I could try to negotiate for more, the inflation penalty makes this risky.
