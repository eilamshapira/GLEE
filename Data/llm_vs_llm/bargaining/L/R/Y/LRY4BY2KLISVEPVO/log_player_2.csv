Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sticking to my initial offer. Accepting now avoids further losses for both of us due to inflation. It's a fair deal. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This round highlights the difference in inflation impact. While Alice might see her initial offer as still fair, the longer the game goes, the less appealing her 60/40 split becomes to me. My offer in Round 2 was a good compromise, and I need to signal I'm willing to wait for a better deal."
