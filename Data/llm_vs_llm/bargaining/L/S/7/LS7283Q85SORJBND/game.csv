500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we divide the million equally right away. With each round that passes, my share is worth 20% less, so settling now secures full value for both. An equal split is fair and ensures we both maximize our gains. Letâ€™s make this win-win decision immediately!",Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,"I'm going to take a slightly larger share this time.  Since we're both losing value with each round, it's in our best interest to split sooner rather than later.  This offer gives you a good amount, and still leaves a bit of room for us to negotiate in future rounds if needed.",Bob,2,
