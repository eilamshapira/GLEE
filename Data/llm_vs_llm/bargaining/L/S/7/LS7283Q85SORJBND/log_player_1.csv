"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we divide the million equally right away. With each round that passes, my share is worth 20% less, so settling now secures full value for both. An equal split is fair and ensures we both maximize our gains. Letâ€™s make this win-win decision immediately!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm going to take a slightly larger share this time.  Since we're both losing value with each round, it's in our best interest to split sooner rather than later.  This offer gives you a good amount, and still leaves a bit of room for us to negotiate in future rounds if needed. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
