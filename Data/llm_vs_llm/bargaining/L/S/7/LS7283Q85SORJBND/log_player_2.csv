"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we divide the million equally right away. With each round that passes, my share is worth 20% less, so settling now secures full value for both. An equal split is fair and ensures we both maximize our gains. Letâ€™s make this win-win decision immediately! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I'm going to take a slightly larger share this time.  Since we're both losing value with each round, it's in our best interest to split sooner rather than later.  This offer gives you a good amount, and still leaves a bit of room for us to negotiate in future rounds if needed.""
