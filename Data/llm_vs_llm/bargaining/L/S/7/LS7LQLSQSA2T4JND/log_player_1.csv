"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll consider a fair division while accounting for the inflation that affects me with each passing round.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I suggest this division because it provides both of us with a substantial portion of the money. While an even split might seem fair at first glance, I need to account for the 10% inflation penalty I'll face if we move to another round. This offer gives you a significant portion while allowing me to protect against inflation effects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. Even though it gives me less than my initial proposal, the 45$ I receive now is worth more than potentially getting a higher nominal amount in future rounds due to the 10% inflation penalty I face with each round. If I reject and we continue to another round, my gains would be reduced by another 10%, making it difficult to achieve a better outcome. This is a reasonable compromise."
