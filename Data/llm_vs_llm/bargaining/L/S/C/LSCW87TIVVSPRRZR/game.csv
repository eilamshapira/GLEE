168188.0,831812.0,"Hi Bob, here's my proposal for an immediate agreement: you receive $831812 and I receive $168188. I’ve worked out the numbers by looking ahead at our future bargaining positions (with my money losing 20% in value per round and yours 5%)—if we delay, you’d be in a better position as proposer, but the net discounted value would be lower. Accepting now guarantees you $831812 rather than risking further delay. I believe this is a fair split for both of us if we want to avoid the inflation penalty. What do you say?",Alice,1,

80000.0,920000.0,"Hi Alice, considering the inflation rates, I believe I have a stronger bargaining position. I'm willing to offer you $80000 in this round. If we delay further, the value of the money will decrease more significantly for you than for me. I think it's in both our interests to come to an agreement soon.",Bob,2,
