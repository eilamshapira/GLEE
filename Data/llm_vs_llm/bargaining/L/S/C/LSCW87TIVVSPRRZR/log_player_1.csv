"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 168188, ""bob_gain"": 831812, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal for an immediate agreement: you receive $831,812 and I receive $168,188. I’ve worked out the numbers by looking ahead at our future bargaining positions (with my money losing 20% in value per round and yours 5%)—if we delay, you’d be in a better position as proposer, but the net discounted value would be lower. Accepting now guarantees you $831,812 rather than risking further delay. I believe this is a fair split for both of us if we want to avoid the inflation penalty. What do you say?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation rates, I believe I have a stronger bargaining position. I'm willing to offer you $80000 in this round. If we delay further, the value of the money will decrease more significantly for you than for me. I think it's in both our interests to come to an agreement soon. 
# Alice gain: 80000 
# Bob gain: 920000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
