"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal for an immediate agreement: you receive $831812 and I receive $168188. I’ve worked out the numbers by looking ahead at our future bargaining positions (with my money losing 20% in value per round and yours 5%)—if we delay, you’d be in a better position as proposer, but the net discounted value would be lower. Accepting now guarantees you $831812 rather than risking further delay. I believe this is a fair split for both of us if we want to avoid the inflation penalty. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 831812 
# Alice gain: 168188 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 920000, 
""alice_gain"": 80000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering the inflation rates, I believe I have a stronger bargaining position. I'm willing to offer you $80,000 in this round. If we delay further, the value of the money will decrease more significantly for you than for me. I think it's in both our interests to come to an agreement soon.""}"
