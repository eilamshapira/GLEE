990000.0,10000.0,I propose a fair division based on my effort in getting this game started. Hope you agree!,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
0.0,1000000.0,"Alice, we both know that further rounds only hurt your share—with each round your money loses 5% of its value while mine remains intact. In round 3 you’d be in the proposer’s seat, but the backward‐induction logic leaves you virtually nothing given the discounting. To avoid a painful erosion of value on your side, I propose that I take the entire 1000000 now. This is the best you can secure, so please accept my offer.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
950000.0,50000.0,"Bob, while I appreciate your 'logic', I won't be bullied into accepting an unfair deal. I'm proposing a more balanced split this time.  Let's be reasonable and come to an agreement that benefits both of us.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
20000.0,980000.0,"Alice, let's be pragmatic. Every additional round costs you roughly 5% in value—not a small price for a delayed promise. In round 4, while the pot remains at $1000000 for me, your share is already discounted by about 14.26% relative to round 1. In light of this, I'm offering you $20000 nominal (worth about $17150 in round-1 value) to close the deal now. This offer is structured to save you more loss than if we drag the game on, so I urge you to accept and secure your guaranteed share before further discounting takes its toll.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
900000.0,100000.0,"Bob, we're getting closer. I'm willing to compromise, but your offer is still too far off. This time, I'm proposing a significant increase in your share to reach a more equitable solution. Let's make this work!",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
857143.0,142857.0,"Alice, consider the effect of further delays: with each round, your share’s real value shrinks considerably. At round 6, 857143 dollars to you translates to roughly 660000 in today’s purchasing power—much better than what you’d likely secure as proposer in round 7, given that further inflation will wipe away more of your share’s value. I’m offering you this deal now to safeguard as much value as possible. I urge you to accept it.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
850000.0,150000.0,"Bob, your math might be right, but I'm still not comfortable with such a lopsided split.  I'm offering you a much larger share this time.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us before the inflation eats away any more of our potential gains.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
1.0,999999.0,"Alice, we’re now in round 8 and time isn’t on your side. As you well know, every delay further erodes your pot—your money is now only worth about 69.8% of its original value. If you reject this offer, you'll become the proposer in round 9, but our backward‐induction analysis tells us that you'll end up with nothing. I’m giving you a token $1 because that’s all you’d realistically secure if we continue. Accept this now to salvage even the smallest value, because if we go further, you end up with zero.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
800000.0,200000.0,"Bob, your threats are getting old.  I'm not going to give up on getting a fair share, especially since you're the one who's been refusing to compromise. I'm offering you a significant amount this time.  Let's work together to make this happen before the inflation takes everything.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
1.0,999999.0,"Alice, we’ve reached round 10. Look at the facts—if you reject this offer, backward‐induction tells us that your best outcome in the ensuing rounds is nothing, as my position only strengthens. In round 11 you’d be the proposer, but given that in round 12 I would ultimately secure the full pot, you’d be forced into accepting a deal that leaves you empty‐handed. I’m offering you a token $1 now, which, while small, is far better than the zero you’d get by waiting. Please accept and end this costly process now.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
750000.0,250000.0,"Bob, I'm tired of your backward-induction nonsense. You've been unwilling to budge from your position this entire time.  This is my final offer.  Take it or leave it, but I'm not going to give up without a fight. Let's see if you can find a way to justify taking less money.",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,reject
1.0,999999.0,"Alice, this is round 12 — the final round. At this point, your share is discounted by roughly 45% relative to its original value, meaning that every dollar you get is worth considerably less. If you reject this offer, neither of us walks away with anything. I’m offering you a token $1 to secure at least a minimal return rather than ending the game empty‐handed. Accept this proposal and salvage what little value you have left before it’s completely eroded.",Bob,12,
