Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we both know that further rounds only hurt your share—with each round your money loses 5% of its value while mine remains intact. In round 3 you’d be in the proposer’s seat, but the backward‐induction logic leaves you virtually nothing given the discounting. To avoid a painful erosion of value on your side, I propose that I take the entire 1000000 now. This is the best you can secure, so please accept my offer. 
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 1000000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be pragmatic. Every additional round costs you roughly 5% in value—not a small price for a delayed promise. In round 4, while the pot remains at $1000000 for me, your share is already discounted by about 14.26% relative to round 1. In light of this, I'm offering you $20000 nominal (worth about $17150 in round-1 value) to close the deal now. This offer is structured to save you more loss than if we drag the game on, so I urge you to accept and secure your guaranteed share before further discounting takes its toll.

# Bob gain: 980000

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, consider the effect of further delays: with each round, your share’s real value shrinks considerably. At round 6, 857143 dollars to you translates to roughly 660000 in today’s purchasing power—much better than what you’d likely secure as proposer in round 7, given that further inflation will wipe away more of your share’s value. I’m offering you this deal now to safeguard as much value as possible. I urge you to accept it.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we’re now in round 8 and time isn’t on your side. As you well know, every delay further erodes your pot—your money is now only worth about 69.8% of its original value. If you reject this offer, you'll become the proposer in round 9, but our backward‐induction analysis tells us that you'll end up with nothing. I’m giving you a token $1 because that’s all you’d realistically secure if we continue. Accept this now to salvage even the smallest value, because if we go further, you end up with zero.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we’ve reached round 10. Look at the facts—if you reject this offer, backward‐induction tells us that your best outcome in the ensuing rounds is nothing, as my position only strengthens. In round 11 you’d be the proposer, but given that in round 12 I would ultimately secure the full pot, you’d be forced into accepting a deal that leaves you empty‐handed. I’m offering you a token $1 now, which, while small, is far better than the zero you’d get by waiting. Please accept and end this costly process now.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is round 12 — the final round. At this point, your share is discounted by roughly 45% relative to its original value, meaning that every dollar you get is worth considerably less. If you reject this offer, neither of us walks away with anything. I’m offering you a token $1 to secure at least a minimal return rather than ending the game empty‐handed.
