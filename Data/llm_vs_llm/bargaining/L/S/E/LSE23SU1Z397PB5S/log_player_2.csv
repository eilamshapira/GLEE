In round 3 you’d be in the proposer’s seat, but the backward‐induction logic leaves you virtually nothing given the discounting. To avoid a painful erosion of value on your side, I propose that I take the entire 1,000,000 now. This is the best you can secure, so please accept my offer.""}"

Round 3

Every additional round costs you roughly 5% in value—not a small price for a delayed promise. In round 4, while the pot remains at $1,000,000 for me, your share is already discounted by about 14.26% relative to round 1. In light of this, I'm offering you $20,000 nominal (worth about $17,150 in round-1 value) to close the deal now. This offer is structured to save you more loss than if we drag the game on, so I urge you to accept and secure your guaranteed share before further discounting takes its toll.""}"

Alice's offer:

I’m giving you a token $1 because that’s all you’d realistically secure if we continue. Accept this now to salvage even the smallest value, because if we go further, you end up with zero.""}"
