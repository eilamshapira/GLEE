20.83,79.17,"Hi Bob, considering how waiting devalues the money for me (20% per round) and for you (5% per round), I propose a division that reflects our respective time‐preferences. By accepting now, you'll secure about $79.17, which is optimal for you compared to the potential loss if we delay further. Please consider accepting this offer.",Alice,1,

15.0,85.0,"Alice, I understand your time preference, but I'm willing to wait a bit longer for a better deal. This offer is more fair considering the inflation rate we're facing. Let's see if you're willing to compromise.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it doesn’t come close enough to what I can expect by waiting a round. Considering that in round 3 I would have the opportunity to propose a division that would guarantee me an effective share of about $13.33, your offer—giving me an effective $12—is not acceptable. Let's continue negotiating.",Alice,2,reject
5.56,94.44,"Hi Bob, it's my turn now. I realize the inflation hurts my share more, but if you reject this offer, you'll get to propose in round 4 where you can secure nearly the full pie—about $85 in effective value (which corresponds to roughly $94.44 in nominal terms in round 3). To match that, I’m offering you $94.44 and keeping $5.56 for myself. I believe this is the minimum that makes waiting less appealing for you. I hope you accept.",Alice,3,
