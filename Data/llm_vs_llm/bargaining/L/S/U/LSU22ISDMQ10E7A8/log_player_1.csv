"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 20.83, ""bob_gain"": 79.17, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, considering how waiting devalues the money for me (20% per round) and for you (5% per round), I propose a division that reflects our respective time‐preferences. By accepting now, you'll secure about $79.17, which is optimal for you compared to the potential loss if we delay further. Please consider accepting this offer.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your time preference, but I'm willing to wait a bit longer for a better deal. This offer is more fair considering the inflation rate we're facing. Let's see if you're willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it doesn’t come close enough to what I can expect by waiting a round. Considering that in round 3 I would have the opportunity to propose a division that would guarantee me an effective share of about $13.33, your offer—giving me an effective $12—is not acceptable. Let's continue negotiating.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5.56, ""bob_gain"": 94.44, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, it's my turn now. I realize the inflation hurts my share more, but if you reject this offer, you'll get to propose in round 4 where you can secure nearly the full pie—about $85 in effective value (which corresponds to roughly $94.44 in nominal terms in round 3). To match that, I’m offering you $94.44 and keeping $5.56 for myself. I believe this is the minimum that makes waiting less appealing for you. I hope you accept.""}"
