"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, considering how waiting devalues the money for me (20% per round) and for you (5% per round), I propose a division that reflects our respective time‐preferences. By accepting now, you'll secure about $79.17, which is optimal for you compared to the potential loss if we delay further. Please consider accepting this offer. 
# Bob gain: 79.17 
# Alice gain: 20.83

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, it's my turn now. I realize the inflation hurts my share more, but if you reject this offer, you'll get to propose in round 4 where you can secure nearly the full pie—about $85 in effective value (which corresponds to roughly $94.44 in nominal terms in round 3). To match that, I’m offering you $94.44 and keeping $5.56 for myself. I believe this is the minimum that makes waiting less appealing for you. I hope you accept. 
# Bob gain: 94.44 
# Alice gain: 5.56
