"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer carefully.

Alice is offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000 total, which is 40% of the pot. While this isn't an even split, I need to consider the 5% inflation penalty per round.

If I reject and propose in the next round, the total money will effectively be worth 5% less to me. So even if I could get a higher percentage in the next round, the absolute value might be lower.

Let me analyze:
- Current offer: $400,000
- If I reject, the next round's $1,000,000 is effectively worth $950,000 to me
- I'd need to secure more than 42.1% (400,000/950,000) in the next round to do better

Given the uncertainty about Alice's inflation rate and considering that securing significantly better terms isn't guaranteed, I'll accept this offer.
