Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a more even split. I propose 55-45 in my favor to account for the future inflation that I am subject to. This is a reasonable compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement now. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The inflation rate affects me more severely right now, and I can make a counter-offer that better accounts for my needs. I'll take my chances with the next round, even though I know the money will be worth less to me."
