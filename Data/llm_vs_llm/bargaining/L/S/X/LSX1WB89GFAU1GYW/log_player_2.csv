Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given that I'm experiencing a guaranteed 10% inflation loss each round, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This accounts for my inflation losses while still giving you a substantial portion. Let's reach an agreement now before further depreciation affects us both.
