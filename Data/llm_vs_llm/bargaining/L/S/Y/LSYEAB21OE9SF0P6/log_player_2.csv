"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'm taking 6000$, offering you 4000$. This leaves room for negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me 4000$ out of 10,000$
2. If I reject, next round I can make a counter-offer, but the money will be worth 10% less to me
3. Current value of 4000$ = 4000$
4. Next round's potential maximum value = 9000$ (10,000$ - 10%)
5. This isn't a great first offer - a 60/40 split in Alice's favor

I'll reject this offer because:
- It's the first round, so the inflation penalty isn't too severe yet
- I can make a counter-offer next round
- 40% is too low for an initial offer

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced counter-offer:

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I propose a more balanced split of 55/45 in my favor. This is fairer than your initial offer, and we should try to reach an agreement soon to avoid losing value to inflation.""}

Reasoning:
1. I'm proposing a more balanced split (55/45)
2. This is slightly in my favor but not extremely aggressive
3. I'm mentioning inflation to create urgency
4. The offer is reasonable enough that Alice might accept to avoid further value loss
5. If Alice rejects, we still have room for negotiation in future rounds"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concern about inflation. Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering you 4500$, and I'll take 5500$. This is a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me 4500$ out of 10,000$
2. Due to 19% inflation, 4500$ is actually worth 3645$ to me (4500 * 0.81)
3. Alice is not affected by inflation, so her 5500$ maintains full value
4. If I reject, next round the money will be worth even less to me (29% less than original)
5. Alice knows I'm affected by inflation and is using it as leverage

Even though this isn't an ideal split, given that:
- Inflation is significantly eating into my value
- We've already gone through 3 rounds
- The inflation effect is asymmetric (only affecting me)
- Further negotiations might result in even less real value for me

I will accept this offer. Getting 3645$ in real value now is better than risking further depreciation.
