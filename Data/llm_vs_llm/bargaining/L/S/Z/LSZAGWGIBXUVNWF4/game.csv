6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm offering a fair 60-40 split in your favor compared to the 50-50 we might initially think of. Since the money loses value more quickly for you (20% per round) than for me (5%), it makes sense to accept this offer now rather than counter with your own proposal and lose significant value.",Alice,1,
