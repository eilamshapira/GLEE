"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll play as Alice in this game. Let me analyze the situation:

Since the money loses value each round (5% for me, 20% for Bob), there's an incentive to reach an agreement quickly, especially for Bob. This gives me some leverage.

Here's my offer to Bob:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a fair 60-40 split in your favor compared to the 50-50 we might initially think of. Since the money loses value more quickly for you (20% per round) than for me (5%), it makes sense to accept this offer now rather than counter with your own proposal and lose significant value.""
}
```"
