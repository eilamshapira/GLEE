"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering a fair 60-40 split in your favor compared to the 50-50 we might initially think of. Since the money loses value more quickly for you (20% per round) than for me (5%), it makes sense to accept this offer now rather than counter with your own proposal and lose significant value. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
