"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll approach this game strategically, considering the 10% inflation per round for me. Since Bob will decide whether to accept my offer or proceed to the next round, I should make a reasonable offer that he's likely to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose this division because it gives me a good portion while still offering Bob a substantial amount. With inflation affecting me each round, I want to avoid prolonged negotiations. This fair but slightly advantageous offer gives me 60% of the money while still providing Bob with a significant 40% share."
