"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 550000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair.  A 50/50 split is the best way to maximize our gains and avoid inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The reasoning is: While I initially tried to get a bit more (550k), Bob's counter-offer of a 50/50 split is fair, and accepting now is better than continuing negotiations because:
1. My share is already worth 10% less due to inflation (500k * 0.9 = 450k effective value)
2. If I reject and we continue, my next round would be worth even less
3. A fair split builds goodwill and avoids the risk of getting nothing if we can't agree within 12 rounds"
