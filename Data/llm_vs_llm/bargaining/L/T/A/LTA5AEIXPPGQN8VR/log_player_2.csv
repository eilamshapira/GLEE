"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose to split the amount with a 60-40 ratio. This way, we both get a fair share considering the inflation risk I'm facing. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I take 4000$ (40%) while she gets 6000$ (60%). She mentions she's facing inflation risk, but I know I definitely face 5% inflation per round. If I reject, we go to the next round where I can make a counter-offer, but the total value to me will be reduced by 5%.

If I reject and go to round 2, the 10,000$ will effectively be worth 9,500$ to me. This means even if I proposed a more favorable split in round 2, I'd need to secure more than 42.1% (4000/9500 â‰ˆ 0.421) to do better than accepting the current offer.

Given the uncertainty of whether Alice would accept my counter-offer and the guaranteed 5% inflation penalty, I'll accept this offer.
