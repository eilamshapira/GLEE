"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to make an offer that Bob is likely to accept, considering the decreasing value of the money for him each round. In the first round, I'll aim for a slightly advantageous but still reasonable split.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100 
# Bob gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a terrible offer! Bob is offering me everything and himself nothing. While the value of money is decreasing for him, offering me 100 and himself 0 is not a rational offer, and signals he may not be playing optimally. However, rejecting it means we enter a round where *my* money is worth less. Given this is only round 2, I'm going to reject and try a more balanced approach in my next offer.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, it seems Bob is playing aggressively. Given the value decay for him, and potentially irrational behavior, I need to be more careful. In this round, the money I gain is worth 0% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth 40% less than in the first round.

I'll offer him slightly more to account for the value decay, but still keep a good portion for myself.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100 
# Bob gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","Again, Bob is making an irrational offer of 100 for me and 0 for him. This reinforces my suspicion that he's not playing optimally. While rejecting means another round of value decay for him, it also means a round of value decay for *me* soon. However, accepting this offer gives me the entire pot, which is strategically sound given his seemingly illogical play.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
