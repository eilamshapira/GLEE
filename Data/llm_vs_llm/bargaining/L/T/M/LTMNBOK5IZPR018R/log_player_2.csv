"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $400,000 for me, $600,000 for Alice

2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make an offer
   * But my money will be worth 20% less
   * Alice's money will be worth 10% less
   * So any amount I get will effectively be worth 20% less to me

3. If I reject and we go to next round:
   * $400,000 now = $320,000 next round (in terms of value to me)
   * I would need to get significantly more than $500,000 next round just to break even
   * And Alice would need to accept it despite her smaller depreciation rate

4. Given that Alice will also calculate similarly and knows she has a better depreciation rate, it would be risky to reject.
