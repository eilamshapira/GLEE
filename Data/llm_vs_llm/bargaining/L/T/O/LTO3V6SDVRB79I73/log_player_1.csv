Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it fairly, considering I'm taking the risk of inflation. My offer is reasonable, and we should settle before the value drops further. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

The offer would give me $45, but due to 20% inflation, it's actually worth $36 to me.
If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount I get will be worth another 20% less.

Even though this offer gives Bob more than me, accepting now is better than risking further inflation losses. If I reject, my next offer would need to be significantly higher just to match what I can get now.
