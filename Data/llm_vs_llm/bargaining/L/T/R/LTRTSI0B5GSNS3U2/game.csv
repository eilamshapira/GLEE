3571.43,6428.57,"Hi Bob, in view of the future discounting (where my money loses 20% per round and yours 10%), I propose a division that mirrors our fair bargaining positions. You’d get $6428.57 and I’d take $3571.43 – an offer that gives you as much immediately as you’d expect if the negotiation continued. I hope you agree to settle now.",Alice,1,

3000.0,7000.0,"Alice, I appreciate your attempt to be fair, but your offer doesn't account for the fact that my money is losing value less than yours. I propose a 70/30 split in my favor. This reflects the differing inflation rates and gives you a fair share despite the disadvantage you face. Let's settle this now and avoid further losses.",Bob,2,
