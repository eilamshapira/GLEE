"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 3571.43, ""bob_gain"": 6428.57, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, in view of the future discounting (where my money loses 20% per round and yours 10%), I propose a division that mirrors our fair bargaining positions. You’d get $6428.57 and I’d take $3571.43 – an offer that gives you as much immediately as you’d expect if the negotiation continued. I hope you agree to settle now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your attempt to be fair, but your offer doesn't account for the fact that my money is losing value less than yours. I propose a 70/30 split in my favor. This reflects the differing inflation rates and gives you a fair share despite the disadvantage you face. Let's settle this now and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
