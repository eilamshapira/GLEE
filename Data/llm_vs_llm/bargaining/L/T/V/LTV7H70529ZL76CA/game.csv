600000.0,400000.0,Let's split it 60-40 in my favor to account for inflation. It's a fair start given the decreasing value of money over time.,Alice,1,

500000.0,500000.0,"Let's split it evenly at 50-50. This way, both of us can mitigate the risk of the money's decreasing value over time.",Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,Let's compromise. I'll take 55% and you take 45%. This accounts for the inflation affecting me more than you.,Alice,3,

475000.0,525000.0,"Considering the impact of inflation on both of us, I propose 52.5% for me and 47.5% for you. This should balance out the loss in value you're experiencing more heavily.",Bob,4,
