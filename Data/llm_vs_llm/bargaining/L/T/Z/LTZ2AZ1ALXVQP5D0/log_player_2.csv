"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Alice's offer of an equal split of $500,000 for each of us.

This is a fair offer that gives us both equal shares. However, I need to think strategically about whether I should accept now or make a counter-offer.

If I reject and make a counter-offer, the total amount will decrease by 5% to $950,000. While I could try to get more than half, Alice might then reject my offer, leading to further depreciation.

Given that Alice has offered a perfectly even split right away, and any delay will reduce our collective amount, this seems like a reasonable offer to accept.
