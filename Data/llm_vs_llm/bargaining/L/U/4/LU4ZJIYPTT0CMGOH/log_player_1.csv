Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. This split accounts for future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Bob, my turn to propose a reasonable split that accounts for the time value of money.  This offer is better than what you'll get in future rounds.""
}
```

Reasoning:

- **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing, making each round less valuable than the last.  It's crucial to reach an agreement sooner rather than later.
- **Bob's Offer:** Bob's previous offer was advantageous to him. My offer is a counter that is still better for him than waiting for further rounds and the money depreciating more. 
- **Strategic Positioning:** By being slightly flexible but still firm, I'm showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate but won't be taken advantage of."
