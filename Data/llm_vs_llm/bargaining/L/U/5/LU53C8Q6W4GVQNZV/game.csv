99.0,1.0,"Hi Bob! I propose that I receive $99 and you receive $1. By accepting now you secure your $1 at full value, whereas waiting would drop your payout by 10% in the next round—and as proposer then, you’d have to offer almost all of the money to me to get my agreement. I believe this deal is better for you right away. What do you think?",Alice,1,

9.0,91.0,"Alice, let's be reasonable. You understand that with inflation, waiting until the very end doesn't make sense for either of us. My offer gives you a guaranteed payout now, which is more than you'd get if we wait too long and the money shrinks.  ",Bob,2,

12.5,87.5,"Hi Bob, here’s my offer for round 3: I’ll take $12.5 and you get $87.5. In this round your money is worth 80% of its face value, so your effective gain is 0.8 × 87.5 = $70. If you reject and wait for round 4, you’ll be the proposer but your money will be discounted even further (worth only 70% then), meaning you’d effectively secure around $70 at best. Since this offer gives you at least as much value immediately—and avoids further discount risk—I believe it’s in your best interest to accept. What do you think?",Alice,3,
