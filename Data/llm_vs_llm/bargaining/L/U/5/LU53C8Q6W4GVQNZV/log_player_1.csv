"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Hi Bob! I propose that I receive $99 and you receive $1. By accepting now you secure your $1 at full value, whereas waiting would drop your payout by 10% in the next round—and as proposer then, you’d have to offer almost all of the money to me to get my agreement. I believe this deal is better for you right away. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. You understand that with inflation, waiting until the very end doesn't make sense for either of us. My offer gives you a guaranteed payout now, which is more than you'd get if we wait too long and the money shrinks.   
# Alice gain: 9 
# Bob gain: 91 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 12.5, ""bob_gain"": 87.5, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here’s my offer for round 3: I’ll take $12.5 and you get $87.5. In this round your money is worth 80% of its face value, so your effective gain is 0.8 × 87.5 = $70. If you reject and wait for round 4, you’ll be the proposer but your money will be discounted even further (worth only 70% then), meaning you’d effectively secure around $70 at best. Since this offer gives you at least as much value immediately—and avoids further discount risk—I believe it’s in your best interest to accept. What do you think?""}"
