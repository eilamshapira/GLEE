"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. 

Alice is offering me 2500$ while taking 7500$ for herself. That's a 25%-75% split, which seems quite unfair. 

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me, meaning my 2500$ would effectively become 2000$. For Alice, her 7500$ would only decrease by 5% to 7125$.

While I don't like the uneven split, making a counter-offer might result in an even worse outcome for me if Alice rejects my next proposal, as the value keeps decreasing more rapidly for me than for her.

However, I think I can get a better deal by negotiating, even accounting for the depreciation.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given the asymmetric inflation pressure (20% for me vs 5% for Alice), I need to make a reasonable offer that Alice is likely to accept, while improving my position from her initial offer.

I'll propose a 60-40 split in her favor, which is still generous to her but much better than the previous 25-75 split. This would be fair considering we both need to reach an agreement, and it acknowledges her better inflation position while still ensuring I get a reasonable share.

{""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""alice_gain"": 6000}

I propose this split because:
1. It's more equitable than the initial offer
2. Alice still gets the majority of the money
3. If she rejects, her share would depreciate by 5% in the next round
4. It's a reasonable compromise that should be acceptable to both parties"
