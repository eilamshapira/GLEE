Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Before making my offer, I want to calculate the value of the money for both Alice and me after inflation.

For me (Bob), the money is worth 36% less than in the first round, so the value of $1,000,000 is now:
$1,000,000 * (1 - 0.36) = $640,000

For Alice, the money is worth 9.75% less than in the first round, so the value of $1,000,000 is now:
$1,000,000 * (1 - 0.0975) = $902,500

Given this, I'll make the following offer:
```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""alice_gain"": 550000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
