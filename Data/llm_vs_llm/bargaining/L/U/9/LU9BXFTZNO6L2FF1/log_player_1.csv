Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to be generous, Alice, but a 60/40 split seems fair considering the inflation rates we're facing.  This way you still get a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
