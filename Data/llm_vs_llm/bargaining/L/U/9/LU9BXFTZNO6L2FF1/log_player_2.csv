{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to be generous, Alice, but a 60/40 split seems fair considering the inflation rates we're facing.  This way you still get a good amount.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering the impact of inflation on both of us, I propose a 4750/5250 split. This way, we both still get a reasonable share, and it's more balanced than your last offer. 
# Bob gain: 5250 
# Alice gain: 4750 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
