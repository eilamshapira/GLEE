"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's keep it fair and split the money evenly. We both win this way! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. While an even split might seem fair at first glance, I need to account for the 5% inflation penalty per round if I reject. If I make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value would be reduced to $9,500 for me.

Given that this is the first round with no inflation yet, and a 50/50 split is generally considered fair, I'll accept this offer. Rejecting might lead to strategic back-and-forth that ultimately reduces the total value for both of us.
