"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to make an offer to divide $10,000 with Bob. I should keep in mind that the money will be worth 10% less to me in each passing round, so there's an incentive to reach an agreement sooner. However, I also want to make a fair offer that Bob will accept.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose a 50-50 split of the $10,000, which gives each of us $5,000. This is a fair division that respects equality and should be acceptable to Bob. Since I face 10% inflation per round, it's in my interest to reach an agreement now rather than risk further negotiations."
