"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more fair, given the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same, but Bob's offer gives me less, and considering the inflation effect on Bob's gain, I think I can try to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect on Bob's gain, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself while still being reasonable. Since Bob's gain is worth 10% less, and it's now my turn again, I'll aim for a split that takes this into account.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 650000,
  ""bob_gain"": 350000,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust the split to reflect the changing value.""
}
