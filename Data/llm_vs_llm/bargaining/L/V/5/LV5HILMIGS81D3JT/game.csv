60.0,40.0,Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first move and taking initiative. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"I think a 55-45 split is fairer. It's a slight compromise from your initial offer, but it shows good faith and allows us to move closer to an agreement. Let's get this done!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
52.0,48.0,"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's meet in the middle with a 52-48 split. This is a fair compromise that accounts for inflation affecting both of us, and we can avoid further value loss by agreeing now.",Alice,3,
