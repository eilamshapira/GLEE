"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first move and taking initiative. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is fairer. It's a slight compromise from your initial offer, but it shows good faith and allows us to move closer to an agreement. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The value of my potential $45 is reduced by 5% due to inflation, making it effectively worth $42.75. I can still make a better offer in the next round, even accounting for further inflation. Let's continue negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, 
""bob_gain"": 48,
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's meet in the middle with a 52-48 split. This is a fair compromise that accounts for inflation affecting both of us, and we can avoid further value loss by agreeing now.""}"
