Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's meet in the middle with a 52-48 split. This is a fair compromise that accounts for inflation affecting both of us, and we can avoid further value loss by agreeing now. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52
