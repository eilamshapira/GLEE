"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to strategize well here. With inflation rates of 20% for me and 5% for Bob per round, I need to offer something reasonable now since my money loses value faster.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering a fair split where I get slightly more ($550,000) and you get $450,000. This is a good deal for both of us in the first round when the money has full value. If we delay, we both lose due to inflation, but I lose more quickly, so it's in our mutual interest to agree early."
