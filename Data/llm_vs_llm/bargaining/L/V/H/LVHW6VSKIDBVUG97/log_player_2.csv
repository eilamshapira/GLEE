"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each round, I'll make a more favorable offer to myself to compensate for the loss. Here's my proposal:

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value I'd get from Alice's offer is:
350000 * 0.64 (since it's 36% less) = 224000

And the actual value Alice would get is:
650000 * 0.81 (since it's 19% less) = 526500

Given the significant decrease in value for me, I'll accept this offer to minimize further losses.
