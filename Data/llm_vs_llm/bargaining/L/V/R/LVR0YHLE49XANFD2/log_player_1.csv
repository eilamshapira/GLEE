"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since this is the first round, I'll make a reasonable but advantageous offer for myself, considering that Bob's money loses 20% value each round if he refuses.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose this 60-40 split because:
1. It's better than a 50-50 split for me
2. It's still a substantial amount for Bob
3. If Bob refuses, his next round's $100 will only be worth $80 to him, so this offer should be attractive enough"
