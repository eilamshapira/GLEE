"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split it almost evenly. I'll take a slightly bigger share, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 49 
# Alice gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: I get $49, Alice gets $51
2. If I reject and move to next round:
   * Money will be worth 5% less for me
   * The $100 pot would effectively be worth $95 to me
   * Even if I propose a better split next round, I'm already at a disadvantage

Alice's offer is quite fair, nearly 50-50. Given the inflation penalty for waiting, I would lose more value by rejecting and trying to negotiate for a slightly better deal in the next round. The 5% inflation would cost me more than the potential gain from a better split.
