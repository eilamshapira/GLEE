"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that there's 20% inflation per round for me and I want to secure a good outcome while being fair, I'll make a reasonable first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this division because it's a fair starting point that gives me a slight advantage while still offering Bob a substantial amount. If Bob rejects, my next opportunity to make an offer will be worth 20% less to me, so I want to make this first offer attractive enough to potentially get accepted."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept now, I get $4500, but it's worth 20% less than round 1 value, so effectively it's worth $3600 to me
2. If I reject, I can make another offer next round, but that money will be worth another 20% less to me
3. I can see that inflation affects Bob less (only 5% per round) which gives him a stronger negotiating position
4. With 10 rounds still remaining but steep inflation for me, delaying too much could be risky

Given these factors, while the split isn't ideal, the high inflation rate affecting me makes it reasonable to accept this offer rather than risk getting even less value in later rounds.
