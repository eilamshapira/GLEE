"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I suggest a fair split considering our different inflation rates. You get 450k, I get 550k. This way we both walk away with a good deal before inflation reduces the value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given that your money loses value at 20% per round while mine only at 5%, this split is actually fair when accounting for inflation. If you reject, your share would be worth significantly less next round. Let's conclude this now to maximize value for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept now, I get $400,000 at 80% value = $320,000 effective value
2. If I reject and propose next round:
   - The total will be worth even less (60% for me, 90% for Bob)
   - Even if I propose a higher split in my favor, Bob might reject
   - The continued inflation puts me at a disadvantage

While I'd prefer a larger share, Bob's argument about inflation is valid. Getting $320,000 in effective value now is better than risking further devaluation.
