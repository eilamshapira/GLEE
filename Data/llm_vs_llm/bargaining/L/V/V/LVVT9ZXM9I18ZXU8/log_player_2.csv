"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a fair split considering our different inflation rates. You get 450k, I get 550k. This way we both walk away with a good deal before inflation reduces the value. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Currently offered: $450,000 for me
2. If I reject:
   * Next round my money would be worth 5% less
   * Alice's money would be worth 20% less
   * I would get to make the next proposal
   * Alice would be more motivated to accept due to her higher inflation rate

Given that Alice's inflation rate (20%) is much higher than mine (5%), I have more negotiating power. If I reject and propose in the next round, Alice will be under more pressure to accept due to her steeper value loss.

I could potentially get a better deal in the next round, as $550,000 - 20% would be worth much less to Alice than $450,000 - 5% would be to me.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice faces a much higher inflation rate (20% vs my 5%), I'll propose a split more in my favor, but not too extreme to ensure she accepts rather than moving to another round where she'd lose even more value.

{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Given that your money loses value at 20% per round while mine only at 5%, this split is actually fair when accounting for inflation. If you reject, your share would be worth significantly less next round. Let's conclude this now to maximize value for both of us.""}"
