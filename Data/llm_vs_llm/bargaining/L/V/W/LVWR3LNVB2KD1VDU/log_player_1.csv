"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an initial offer, considering the inflation aspect of the game.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering Bob $4,000 which is a substantial portion. Since Bob faces 20% inflation each round while I face 0%, it's in his interest to accept a reasonable offer now rather than waiting. This is a fair offer that recognizes both our positions in the game."
