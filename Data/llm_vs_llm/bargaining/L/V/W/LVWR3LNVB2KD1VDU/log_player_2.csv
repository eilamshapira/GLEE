"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that we are dividing $10,000 and Alice is offering me $4,000 while keeping $6,000 for herself, I need to consider the inflation penalty. If I reject this offer, we move to the next round where I can make a counter-offer, but the money will be worth 20% less to me.

If I reject and we go to round 2, the $10,000 would effectively be worth only $8,000 to me due to the 20% inflation penalty. This means even if I proposed a more favorable split in the next round, I'd be working with a reduced total value.

The current offer of $4,000 is 40% of the total, which is less than half but still substantial. If I reject and try to get more in round 2, I'd need to secure significantly more than $4,000 to compensate for the 20% inflation penalty.
