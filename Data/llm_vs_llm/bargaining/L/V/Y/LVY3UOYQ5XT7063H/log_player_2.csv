"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $400,000 out of $1,000,000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 20% inflation, if I wait until next round, any amount I get will be worth 20% less
4. If I get $400,000 now, that's better than getting $500,000 in the next round (which would be worth $400,000 after 20% inflation)
5. Therefore, while Alice's offer isn't exactly 50-50, it's a reasonable offer considering the inflation penalty I face
