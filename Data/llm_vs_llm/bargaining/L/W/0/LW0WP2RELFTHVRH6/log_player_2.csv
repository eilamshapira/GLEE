  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Alice, I need a bit more to offset the inflation I'm facing. Let's aim for a 55/45 split. This is still very generous for you considering the inflation that will hit me in later rounds.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concern about inflation, Bob. Let's meet in the middle with a 47.5/52.5 split. This way, you get more than last time, but it's still fair to both of us considering the inflation you're facing. 
# Bob gain: 525000 
# Alice gain: 475000
