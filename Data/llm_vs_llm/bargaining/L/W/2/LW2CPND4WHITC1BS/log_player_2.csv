"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share for both 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer doesn't seem fair to me, as she's taking 60% of the money while offering me only 40%. Since inflation doesn't affect me (0% less each round), I don't lose anything by rejecting this offer and making my own proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""I propose an equal split of 50-50, which is the fairest division. This way we both benefit equally from the agreement.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle, slightly in my favor due to inflation loss 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has improved her offer from 40-60 to 45-55, claiming inflation affects her. While this is better, I still believe a 50-50 split would be fairest. Since inflation doesn't affect me (0% less each round), I don't lose anything by continuing to negotiate.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""I'm maintaining my offer of a 50-50 split, which remains the fairest division. I understand you mentioned inflation, but from my perspective, a perfectly equal split is the most reasonable solution. I hope we can agree on this fair arrangement.""}"
