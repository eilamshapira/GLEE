"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I want to be fair and make sure we reach an agreement before the money devalues too much.

Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

Explanation: I'm proposing a slight advantage for myself (5500 vs 4500) in the first round. I hope Bob will accept this proposal, considering the depreciation of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I see Bob is trying to get the same split he wanted in the first round. However, with inflation, his offer is less attractive. Let's calculate the actual value:

*   **My value of \$4500:** \$4500 * 0.9 (10% less) = \$4050 (in round 1 dollars)
*   **Bob's value of \$5500:** \$5500 * 0.8 (20% less) = \$4400 (in round 1 dollars)

I'm still not convinced this is a fair deal, but I don't want to lose more value. I'll try to negotiate a bit more.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's my turn to make an offer again. Remembering the inflation, I need to make it more appealing to Bob while still ensuring I get a decent amount. Since Bob wanted 5500 initially, I'll try to be closer to his initial request.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800
}
```

Explanation: I'm reducing my share slightly from my first offer. I hope Bob considers this and accepts, as further delays will devalue the money even more for both of us."
