"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a slightly favorable split for me while keeping it fair enough that Bob might accept:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I believe this 55-45 split is reasonable as I'm making the first move, but it's not so skewed that Bob would immediately reject it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The split is too unfavorable. I'd rather make another proposal in the next round to try to reach a more equitable arrangement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split this time, closer to 50-50 to increase chances of acceptance:

{""alice_gain"": 510000, ""bob_gain"": 490000}

This offer is very close to an even split, with just a slight advantage to me. It's more favorable to Bob than my first offer, showing I'm willing to compromise."
