"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""I suggest a fair 60-40 split. Given that your money devalues faster (20% vs my 10% per round), it's in your interest to accept now rather than delay.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the devaluation situation, but 40 is too low for me. How about we meet closer to the middle? 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The offer is reasonable considering several factors:
1. Due to inflation, delaying further would reduce the real value for both of us
2. The 55-45 split is fair and close to my initial proposal
3. Getting 55$ now is better than risking further negotiations with compounding inflation"
