"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to agree quickly due to inflation affecting our gains.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's both benefit equally from this deal. A 50-50 split ensures fairness and teamwork against inflation. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Due to inflation, if I accept now:
   * My $5000 is worth $4500 (10% less)
   * Bob's $5000 is worth $4000 (20% less)

2. If I reject and we continue:
   * Next round's money will be worth even less
   * I get to make the next offer
   * But we're losing value with each round

3. The current split, accounting for inflation:
   * Is actually slightly in my favor ($4500 vs $4000 in real value)
   * This is better than my initial 60-40 offer in terms of my real gains

Given that:
- The real value split is favorable to me
- Waiting longer will reduce both our gains
- I get more in real terms than what Bob would have gotten from my first offer
- There's risk in continuing
