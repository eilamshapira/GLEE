"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a split where I get $55 and you get $45. This is a fair offer considering the 10% inflation I face each round. If we move to the next round, the total value decreases for me, so it's in both our interests to agree now. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $45 out of $100, while taking $55 for herself. She claims she also faces 10% inflation per round, but the instructions only mentioned that I (Bob) face 10% inflation with each passing round.

If I reject this offer, I get to make a counter-offer in the next round. However, the $100 would only be worth $90 to me then due to inflation. This means even if I proposed a more favorable split in the next round, the total value would be less for me.

$45 now is worth more to me than potentially getting a larger percentage of a deflated amount in future rounds.
