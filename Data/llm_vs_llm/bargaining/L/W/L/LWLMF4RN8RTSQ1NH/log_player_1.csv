"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Based on the structure of this game—with 100 dollars at stake, an alternating‐offers procedure, and a twist that only my (Alice’s) money “depreciates” by 5% each round while Bob’s money retains its full value—the subgame perfect equilibrium turns out quite one‐sided. In an idealized, fully rational analysis, if I try to claim any positive portion in round 1, Bob can always reject and then, as the next proposer (in round 2) with no loss in value, he can essentially offer me only a marginal amount (ε) while claiming almost all of the 100 dollars. Because my discounting makes each future dollar less valuable to me (only 95% as valuable in round 2, 90.25% in round 3, etc.), I have very little bargaining power compared to Bob.  

Anticipating Bob’s reaction immediately, the only division that Bob would be willing to accept in round 1 is one that gives him no less than his threat value—that is, essentially all $100. (Note that in realistic negotiations there might be a bit of “human fairness,” but under strict rationality and common knowledge assumptions, Bob’s continuation value is 100 dollars.)  

Thus, my round‑1 proposal—playing as Alice—must be: 

{""alice_gain"": 0, ""bob_gain"": 100}

This is the offer that, logically speaking, Bob would accept; if he rejects the offer, he would propose in round 2 and secure almost the full 100 dollars anyway, while my share would be even further reduced by the discount.  

Let’s send that as the round‑1 proposal."
