"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we divide the $10,000 with $6,000 for me and $4,000 for you. Letâ€™s agree now so that we both avoid further devaluation. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, your offer is appealing, but I think a 52/48 split is more reflective of the potential losses we both face with further inflation. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
