"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. Since you lose 10% value each round, taking this deal now gives you more value than a 50-50 split next round.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's be reasonable. I propose a 55/45 split.  Anything less for me is not worth the risk with inflation eating away at the value. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

If I reject, I can propose again in round 3, but Bob's value will decrease by another 10%. Right now, Bob's 55 is actually worth 49.5 to him (55 * 0.9). If I counter-offer in the next round, any amount to Bob will be worth even less to him.

I could try to leverage this to get a better deal, but there's also the risk of prolonging negotiations too long and both of us getting nothing.
