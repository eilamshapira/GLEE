"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 473684 
# Alice gain: 526316 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
- Alice is offering me $473,684 out of the $1,000,000
- If I reject, I can make my own offer next round
- However, due to 10% inflation, the $1,000,000 will only be worth $900,000 to me in the next round
- My maximum potential gain next round would be if Alice accepts my offer for all $900,000

The current offer gives me 47.37% of the total amount. If I reject and make a very aggressive counter-offer next round that isn't accepted, I'd lose value due to inflation.

Given that Alice has made a relatively fair offer (close to 50/50) and inflation will reduce my potential gains in future rounds, I'll accept this offer.
