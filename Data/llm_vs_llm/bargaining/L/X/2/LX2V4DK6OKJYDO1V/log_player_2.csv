"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With Alice's offer, I would get $4,000. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me, meaning any amount I get will effectively be reduced by 20%.

If I reject, even if I propose a better split next round (like 6000/4000 in my favor), my $6,000 would actually be worth $4,800 due to inflation. This is only $800 more than accepting the current offer, and Alice might reject it anyway, leading to further rounds and more inflation.

The current offer of $4,000 is a reasonable amount (40% of the total), and avoiding inflation makes it more attractive.
