"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
- Alice is offering me $400,000 out of $1,000,000
- That's a 40/60 split, favoring Alice
- If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
- However, the money will be worth 5% less (950,000 total)
- Getting $400,000 now is better than risking further devaluation

While the split isn't completely fair, it's a reasonable first offer and I'd rather secure a good amount now than risk losing value in subsequent rounds.
