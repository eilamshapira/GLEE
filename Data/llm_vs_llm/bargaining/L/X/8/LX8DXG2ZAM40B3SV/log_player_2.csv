"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing an even 50/50 split, which seems fair at first glance. However, I need to account for the inflation effect.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the money will be worth 5% less to me. That means if I propose a higher amount for myself in round 2, I need to get more than 52.63$ (since 52.63$ with 5% less value equals 50$) to come out ahead.

Given that this is a fair initial offer and the risk of declining value with each round, I'll accept this offer.
