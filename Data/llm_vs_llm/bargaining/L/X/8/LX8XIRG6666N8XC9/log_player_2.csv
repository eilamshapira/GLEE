"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to think carefully about this offer. In a fair split, we'd each get $5,000. However, Alice faces a 20% devaluation per round while I don't face any inflation penalty. This means if we delay, Alice's share becomes worth less to her, while mine maintains full value.

If I reject now and offer my own proposal next round, Alice would only get 80% of the value from her share. This puts me in a stronger negotiating position with each passing round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I have a stronger position due to Alice facing 20% devaluation per round while I face none, I'll propose a division that reflects this advantage while still being reasonable enough for Alice to consider accepting.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, 
""alice_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering Alice $4,000, which at this round is still worth $4,000 * 0.8 = $3,200 in value to her. If she rejects and we go to round 3, her potential gains will be worth even less to her due to the 20% devaluation per round, so accepting now would be rational."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer carefully. She's offering me $5,200 and taking $4,800 for herself. 

Since I face no inflation penalty, the $5,200 is worth full value to me. For Alice, her $4,800 is worth only 64% of its original value (36% less due to inflation), which equals $4,800 Ã— 0.64 = $3,072 in original value terms.

This offer is better for me than the initial 50-50 split, and if I reject, we'll go to round 4 where Alice's money will devalue further (by 20% more). I'm getting more than half of the total, which is a favorable outcome given the inflation dynamics.
