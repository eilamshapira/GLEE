6000.0,4000.0,"I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering we both need to reach an agreement quickly due to inflation. This gives you a substantial $4000 while acknowledging my first-mover position.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4750.0,5250.0,"My turn.  I understand your position, but a 50/50 split seems fair. I propose a slight advantage for me considering the time pressure and the risk I took rejecting your offer. This way we both benefit.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6500.0,3500.0,"Bob, I need to be more aggressive with my offer because inflation affects me much more severely (20% per round) compared to your 5%. At this point, my 6500 is only worth 5200 to me due to inflation, while your 3500 is still worth 3325. We need to account for this disparity to reach a fair deal.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle ground, but 65/35 is too skewed in your favor.  I'm proposing 55/45.  This acknowledges the time pressure while still being a reasonable split considering your inflation situation.",Bob,4,
