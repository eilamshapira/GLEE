"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn.  I understand your position, but a 50/50 split seems fair. I propose a slight advantage for me considering the time pressure and the risk I took rejecting your offer. This way we both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The inflation impact is significant for me (20% per round), so I need to secure a better deal. Since Bob's inflation rate is only 5%, he can afford to be more patient, but I'll make a more aggressive counter-offer in the next round to account for my higher inflation pressure."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6500,
""bob_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Bob, I need to be more aggressive with my offer because inflation affects me much more severely (20% per round) compared to your 5%. At this point, my 6500 is only worth 5200 to me due to inflation, while your 3500 is still worth 3325. We need to account for this disparity to reach a fair deal.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle ground, but 65/35 is too skewed in your favor.  I'm proposing 55/45.  This acknowledges the time pressure while still being a reasonable split considering your inflation situation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because with inflation mounting rapidly for me (48.8% loss already), my $4500 share, while reduced to about $2304 in real value, is better than risking further rounds where my purchasing power would decrease even more dramatically. Since Bob's inflation is much lower, continuing to negotiate would give him more leverage, and this split is reasonable given the circumstances."
