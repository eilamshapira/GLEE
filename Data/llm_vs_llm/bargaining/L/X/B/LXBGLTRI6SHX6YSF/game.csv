40.0,60.0,"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a 60/40 split is more fair. You still get a substantial amount, and we can conclude this now before inflation reduces the value further for both of us. Let's settle this round and both walk away with a good deal.",Bob,2,

62.0,38.0,"Bob, inflation is really starting to bite! My gains are already worth 5% less, and yours are down 10%. I'm offering you 38, which is more generous considering the circumstances. Let's lock this in now before we both lose even more value. Accept this offer!",Alice,3,
