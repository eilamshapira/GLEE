Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a 60/40 split is more fair. You still get a substantial amount, and we can conclude this now before inflation reduces the value further for both of us. Let's settle this round and both walk away with a good deal. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60
