"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's split it 55/45. It's a fair offer, and we both walk away with a good amount. Think about the inflation; let's get this done now! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $45 while she gets $55. If I reject and we go to the next round, I'll face 10% inflation on whatever amount I eventually receive. This means in the next round, a full $100 split would only be worth $90 to me.

If I make a counteroffer in the next round, the best I could reasonably hope for might be $60-65. But after 10% inflation, that would be worth $54-58.5 to me - which is better than the current $45 offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I need to make a reasonable counteroffer that considers inflation while still being fair enough that Alice will accept. Since I face 10% inflation per round, I should aim for a better deal than what Alice originally offered.

{""bob_gain"": 60, 
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a 60/40 split is more fair. You still get a substantial amount, and we can conclude this now before inflation reduces the value further for both of us. Let's settle this round and both walk away with a good deal.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, inflation is really starting to bite! My gains are already worth 5% less, and yours are down 10%. I'm offering you 38, which is more generous considering the circumstances. Let's lock this in now before we both lose even more value. Accept this offer! 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer considering the inflation effects. 

Alice is now offering me $38, which after the 19% inflation from round 1 would be worth about $30.78 in round 1 value. Meanwhile, she's taking $62, which with her 9.75% inflation would be worth about $55.96 in round 1 value.

This offer is worse for me than her initial offer of $45 in round 1. If I reject and make a counteroffer in round 4, I'll face even more inflation. However, Alice's inflation rate seems to be increasing at a slower pace than mine, which puts me at a disadvantage in future rounds.

Given that my bargaining position is deteriorating faster than hers due to the different inflation rates, and that further delays will likely result in even worse terms for me:
