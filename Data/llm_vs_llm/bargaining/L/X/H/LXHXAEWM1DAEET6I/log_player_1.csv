"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I need a bit more to compensate for the inflation next round. Let's settle this quickly to avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept this offer, I'll get $4500, but it's worth 10% less than the original value, so I'll effectively get $4500 * 0.9 = $4050.

If I reject this offer, the money will be worth even less in the next round. Since Bob's gain is worth 20% less, he might be more motivated to accept a deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each round, and it's already worth 20% less for Bob, I'll try to make an offer that takes this into account.

In Round 3, the money is worth 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 of its original value for me.

Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5200, 
""bob_gain"": 4800, 
""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's settle this quickly. I'm giving you a fair share, don't let it slip away.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's find a middle ground. This deal considers your interests as well. Don't let inflation reduce our gains further. 
# Alice gain: 4600 
# Bob gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept this offer, I'll get $4600, but it's worth 27.1% less than the original value, so I'll effectively get $4600 * 0.729 = $3352.40.

If I reject this offer, the money will be worth even less in the next round. Since Bob's gain is worth 48.8% less, he's already taking a significant hit due to inflation.

Given the significant reduction in value for both of us, I think it's time to consider accepting an offer. Bob's offer seems reasonable, and finding a middle ground might be the best option at this point.
