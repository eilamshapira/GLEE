5200.0,4800.0,"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about inflation affecting your side. However, since you face 5% inflation per round, a fair adjustment would be to give you slightly less than 50% in absolute dollars so we both end up with roughly equal value. With 4800, at 5% inflation, it's worth 4560 to you, which is close to what you offered me. This is more fair than your previous proposal.",Alice,3,
