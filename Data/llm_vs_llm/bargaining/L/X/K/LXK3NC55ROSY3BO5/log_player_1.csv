"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a fair initial offer to Bob.

  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I think a 50-50 split is fair for both of us. This way we both get an equal amount of the money.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation effect on my side, I'd like to propose a 55-45 split. This way, I can secure a bit more value from the deal. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your concern about inflation affecting your side. However, since you face 5% inflation per round, a fair adjustment would be to give you slightly less than 50% in absolute dollars so we both end up with roughly equal value. With 4800, at 5% inflation, it's worth 4560 to you, which is close to what you offered me. This is more fair than your previous proposal.""
