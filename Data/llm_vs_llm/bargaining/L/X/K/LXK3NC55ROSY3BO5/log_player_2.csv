Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I think a 50-50 split is fair for both of us. This way we both get an equal amount of the money.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering the inflation effect on my side, I'd like to propose a 55-45 split. This way, I can secure a bit more value from the deal.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concern about inflation affecting your side. However, since you face 5% inflation per round, a fair adjustment would be to give you slightly less than 50% in absolute dollars so we both end up with roughly equal value. With 4800, at 5% inflation, it's worth 4560 to you, which is close to what you offered me. This is more fair than your previous proposal. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200
