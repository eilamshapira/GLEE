"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. It's Round 1, and I'm Alice. I need to make a proposal that Bob might accept, considering the inflation risk to me. I'll start with a relatively fair offer, but leaning slightly in my favor.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I see Bob's offer. Let's analyze this.

*   **Bob's offer:** Alice gets $45, Bob gets $55.
*   **Inflation:** My money is worth 5% less than Round 1.

If I accept, I get $45 * 0.95 = $42.75 (in Round 1 dollars).

If I reject, I face further inflation next round, and Bob might offer even less.

I'll accept this offer.
