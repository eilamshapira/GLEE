"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation rates, I propose a 55/45 split in my favor to account for the faster devaluation on my side. Let's find a balance that works for both of us before the value drops too much. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation rates and the fact that the money I gain is worth 10% less, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the total amount is $1,000,000, and it's worth 10% less to me, the actual value I consider is $1,000,000 * 0.9 = $900,000. 

Bob's offer gives me $450,000, which is half of the original amount, but considering the inflation, it's actually 50% of the $900,000.

I think I can do better than this, so I'll reject the offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, now it's my turn again. Considering the inflation rates, the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round (which was already 10% less than the original), so it's worth 19% less than the original value. The money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the previous round (which was already 5% less than the original), so it's worth 10% less than the original value.

To account for this, I'll make a new offer. I'll propose a 58/42 split in my favor.

{""alice_gain"": 580000, 
""bob_gain"": 420000, 
""message"": ""Considering the increasing inflation gap, I propose a 58/42 split. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement before the value drops further.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the rapid inflation on my side, I'm proposing a 57.5/42.5 split. This adjustment aims to balance the devaluation rates between us. Let's reach an agreement soon to preserve the value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 425000 
# Bob gain: 575000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection from Bob. Now, considering the inflation rates, the money I gain is worth 27.1% less than the original value, and the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less.

Let's calculate the actual value I consider: $1,000,000 * (1 - 0.271) = $1,000,000 * 0.729 = $729,000.

Bob's offer gives me $425,000, which is approximately 58.3% of the devalued amount I consider ($729,000).

Given the increasing inflation gap, I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the next rounds. Bob's offer seems reasonable, considering the circumstances.
