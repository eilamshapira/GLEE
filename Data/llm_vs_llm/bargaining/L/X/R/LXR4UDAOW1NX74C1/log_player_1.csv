"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because it's close to equal but gives me a small advantage as the first mover. It's reasonable enough that Bob should accept it rather than risk losing value to inflation in the next round."
