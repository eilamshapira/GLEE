"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","For the first round, I'll make a reasonable offer. Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 20% less for Bob with each passing round, I'll try to be somewhat generous to encourage Bob to accept.

Here's my offer:
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

This way, I get 60% of the money, and Bob gets 40%. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is still worth the same, but Bob's offer gives him a larger share, I need to consider the value of the money for both of us.

For Bob, the $550,000 is worth 20% less than the original value, so it's effectively worth $440,000 to him (since 20% of $550,000 is $110,000, and $550,000 - $110,000 = $440,000).

As for me, the $450,000 is still worth its original value.

Considering this, I think I can do better than this offer. I'll reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Now it's my turn again. Since Bob's offer in the previous round gave him a larger share, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself while still being reasonable.

Considering the inflation, Bob's share will be worth even less to him in this round (40% less than the original value, since 20% less in each of the two rounds).

Here's my offer:
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}

This way, I get a larger share, and Bob gets a smaller share, but it's still worth something to him. Let's see how he responds!"
