"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's proposal. She's offering me $400,000 while taking $600,000 for herself.

If I reject, we go to the next round, but I'll face 20% inflation on my value, so each dollar would be worth 20% less to me. Alice doesn't face any inflation penalty.

Let me calculate: If I reject and propose in round 2, the maximum I could effectively get would be $800,000 (if I proposed keeping $800k and giving Alice $200k and she accepted), but with 20% inflation, that's equivalent to $800,000 × 0.8 = $640,000 in current value.

Alice's offer of $400,000 now is less than what I could potentially get in the next round even accounting for inflation. I should reject and make my own offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair offer that accounts for the inflation penalty I face while maximizing my chances of Alice accepting.

Since I'm facing 20% inflation per round but Alice isn't, she has more bargaining power as the game progresses. I need to offer her enough to make it worth accepting rather than waiting for a better deal in future rounds.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's new offer of $350,000 for me and $650,000 for her.

The 36% inflation means that money is now worth 64% of its original value to me. So Alice's offer of $350,000 is equivalent to $350,000 × 0.64 = $224,000 in round 1 value.

If I reject and make an offer in round 4, I'll face 48.8% inflation (1 - 0.8^3), meaning money will be worth 51.2% of original value. Even if I proposed taking most of the money (say $800,000), with inflation that would be equivalent to $800,000 × 0.512 = $409,600 in round 1 value.

However, Alice would likely reject such an aggressive offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation for me. Her current offer of $350,000 (worth $224,000 to me now) is getting worse than her first offer of $400,000.

Given the inflation penalty I face and the trend of decreasing offers, I should accept this offer before it gets worse.
