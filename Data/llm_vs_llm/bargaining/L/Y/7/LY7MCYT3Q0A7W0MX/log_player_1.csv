"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 800, ""bob_gain"": 9200, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal for Round 1: you receive $9,200 and I take $800. Given that waiting costs us both—my dollars losing 20% per round and yours 10%—if you reject, you’d get to propose next round but your best‐case outcome would be about $9,000 in real value. Accepting this offer now not only gives you a little extra over that continuation value, but also avoids further devaluation for both of us. I believe this is a smart, fair way to settle quickly. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your previous proposal, but I believe this division is more fair considering the devaluation rates. If you reject, the value will continue to decrease more significantly for you. Let's settle this round to maximize our gains. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""explanation"": ""Bob’s offer gives me $1,000 nominal in round 2, which—after applying my 20% discount for this round—amounts to an effective value of $800 (in round‐1 dollars). By continuing to round 3 (where I would make a proposal), backward‐induction analysis indicates that I can secure an effective payoff of around $1,846. Since waiting improves my outcome despite further devaluation, I must reject Bob’s round 2 proposal.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 1000, ""bob_gain"": 9000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, for round 3 I propose the following: I get $1,000 and you get $9,000 (nominal dollars). At this stage, my money is valued at 0.64× its face value and yours at 0.81×. This means you’d effectively lock in about $9,000×0.81 ≈ $7,290 in round‑1 terms. If you reject and wait until round 4 to propose, you can at best achieve roughly that same effective value once you account for the further discounting and the necessity of offering me a minimal continuation payoff. Accepting now prevents further devaluation for both of us. I believe this deal is in your best interest—let me know what you think.""}"
