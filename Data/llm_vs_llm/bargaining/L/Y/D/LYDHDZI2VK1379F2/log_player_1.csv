"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering I'm making the first move and taking initiative in the negotiation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This ensures both of us get a fair share while accounting for the decreasing value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
* My potential gain of $4500, with 5% inflation, is worth $4275
* If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount will be worth another 5% less
* The inflation is affecting Bob more severely (20%), so his negotiating position weakens more quickly than mine
* However, another round means even more value loss for both of us

While I could try to negotiate for a better deal next round, the guaranteed $4275 (in round 1 value) is significant enough, and the risk of further value loss through inflation makes accepting the current offer reasonable.
