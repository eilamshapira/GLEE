"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split that accounts for the different inflation rates we face. Since I face higher inflation (20% per round) compared to Bob's 5%, I should aim for a reasonable first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

This offer gives Bob a substantial portion while acknowledging my higher risk from inflation. I propose this split as a fair starting point that respects both our interests."
