"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a division that takes into account the 20% inflation penalty I face in future rounds. Since I need to make an attractive offer while protecting my interests, I'll propose:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

This is a fair offer where I get a slightly larger share to compensate for my inflation disadvantage, while still giving Bob a substantial portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since I face 20% inflation, a $50 share for me is actually worth only $40 now. In the next round, I could make another offer, but my share would be worth even less due to additional inflation. Given that Bob isn't affected by inflation and seems unwilling to give me more than half, this might be the best realistic outcome I can get.
