"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Split it evenly, fair deal""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I take a bit more, still fair 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, I need to consider that when making my decision.

To calculate the value of Bob's offer, I'll multiply my gain by 0.9 (1 - 0.10 inflation):

40 * 0.9 = 36

So, Bob's offer is equivalent to me getting $36.

Considering this, I think I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, now it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, the money I gain is worth 20% less than the original value (10% less in Round 2 and another 10% less in Round 3).

To calculate my offer, I'll make sure that the value I propose for myself is worth more than what I would get if I accepted Bob's previous offer, taking into account the inflation.

Let's say I offer myself 45, which would be worth:

45 * 0.8 (1 - 0.20 inflation) = 36

This is the same value as Bob's previous offer, but now I'm in control. I'll offer Bob a bit less than he offered me, to make it more appealing for him to accept.

Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, 
""bob_gain"": 55, 
""message"": ""Better than last time, consider it""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're losing value, I'm being generous 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 30% less in Round 3 (10% + 10% + 10%) but I have to account for the compounding effect of the inflation, I will use 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.729, which means the money I gain is worth 27.1% less.

To calculate the value of Bob's offer, I'll multiply my gain by 0.729 (1 - 0.271 inflation):

35 * 0.729 = 25.515

So, Bob's offer is equivalent to me getting approximately $25.52.

Considering this, I think I should accept this offer, as the value I would get is still relatively high compared to what I might get in future rounds with increasing inflation.
