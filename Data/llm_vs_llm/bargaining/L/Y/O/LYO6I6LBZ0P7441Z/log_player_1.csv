"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair 50-50 split, which is both equitable and has a good chance of being accepted, avoiding the risk of inflation in future rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

Message to Bob: I propose an equal split of the money - $500,000 each. This is a fair offer that gives us both significant value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept:
   * I get $400,000 (full value)
   * Bob gets $600,000 (but worth 20% less = $480,000 in round 1 value)

2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make another offer
   * But Bob's value will decrease further
   * I still maintain full value

Given that Bob's money is already depreciated, and this offer gives me a significant portion ($400,000), it's reasonable to accept. Further rounds might lead to more difficult negotiations and risk of no agreement.
