"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a strategic first offer, considering that the money loses value faster for me (20%) than for Bob (5%) each round. This incentivizes reaching an agreement sooner rather than later.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

This is a reasonable first offer giving me 60% and Bob 40%. While it favors me, it's not so extreme that Bob would definitely reject it. The faster depreciation rate for me (20%) means I need to secure a good deal early, but I also need to be fair enough that Bob might accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer since it's quite unfavorable to me, especially considering that I have more rounds to negotiate. While I'm aware that my money loses value faster (20% vs 5%), giving Bob 60% in round 2 is too unfavorable. The money I would receive would be worth only 320,000 (400,000 * 0.8) in round 1 terms, while Bob's portion would be worth 570,000 (600,000 * 0.95) in round 1 terms. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that we're now in round 3, I need to be more strategic due to the compounding inflation effects. My money is now worth 64% of round 1 value (0.8 * 0.8), while Bob's is worth about 90% (0.95 * 0.95). I'll make a more compromising offer to increase chances of acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

This offer gives me 55% and Bob 45%, which is more balanced than my first offer. In real value terms, considering inflation:
- My 550,000 is worth about 352,000 in round 1 terms (550,000 * 0.64)
- Bob's 450,000 is worth about 405,000 in round 1 terms (450,000 * 0.9)

This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both the higher inflation rate I face and the need to reach an agreement soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer because it's still too unfavorable. Let's analyze:

My share would be worth: 350,000 * 0.512 = 179,200 (in round 1 terms)
Bob's share would be worth: 650,000 * 0.8574 = 557,310 (in round 1 terms)

This is a very unbalanced distribution where Bob gets more than 3 times my effective value. While I'm aware that the money is losing value faster for me, this split is too extreme. I still have several rounds to negotiate a better deal, though I'll need to be more compromising in my next offer given the rapid value decay."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given we're now in round 5, I need to make a more compelling offer as my money is now worth only 40.96% of round 1 value (0.8^4), while Bob's is worth about 81.45% (0.95^4). The urgency to reach an agreement is increasing.

{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000}

Let's analyze this offer in round 1 terms:
- My 525,000 is worth about 215,040 (525,000 * 0.4096)
- Bob's 475,000 is worth about 386,887 (475,000 * 0.8145)

This is a more balanced offer than my previous ones, giving Bob a larger share while still preserving some value for me. The rapid depreciation of my money means we need to reach an agreement soon, and this offer acknowledges that reality while still maintaining a reasonable position for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because waiting longer will significantly reduce my earnings due to the severe inflation rate I face. Let's analyze:

My share in round 1 terms: 300,000 * 0.3277 = 98,310
Bob's share in round 1 terms: 700,000 * 0.7738 = 541,660

While this isn't an ideal split, if I reject:
1. Next round my money will be worth only 26.21% of original value (0.8^7)
2. Even if I make a better numerical offer, the rapid depreciation means I might end up with less real value
3. We've already gone through 6 rounds, and with 12 rounds total, the risk of getting nothing is becoming significant

The compounding inflation effect is severely impacting my negotiating position, and it's better to secure this amount now rather than risk further depreciation or total loss."
