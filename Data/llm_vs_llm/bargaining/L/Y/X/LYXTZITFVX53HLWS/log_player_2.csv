"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer gives me $400,000 and Alice $600,000
2. If I reject, we move to round 2 where:
   - Money will be worth 5% less for me (I'll lose $20,000 of value)
   - Money will be worth 20% less for Alice (she'll lose $120,000 of value)
3. I'll get to make the next proposal
4. This 60-40 split in Alice's favor isn't terrible, but I can probably do better

Given that Alice's money devalues much faster than mine (20% vs 5%), and I get to make the next proposal, I'll reject this offer. The significant difference in our inflation rates gives me leverage in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that the money has depreciated one round:
- For me, the $1M is now worth $950,000 (95% of original value)
- For Alice, it's worth $800,000 (80% of original value)

I'll propose a split that takes advantage of this depreciation but is still attractive enough for Alice to accept:

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

This offer is strategic because:
1. For me, 600K is worth 570K (after 5% depreciation)
2. For Alice, 400K is worth 320K (after 20% depreciation)
3. If she rejects, her next round's money will be worth even less
4. This is still better for her than waiting several more rounds where her value drops dramatically
5. It's a reasonable counter to her initial 60-40 split, just reversed in my favor"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $450,000, which after 9.75% inflation is worth about $406,125
2. Her $550,000 would be worth only $352,000 after 36% inflation
3. If I reject:
   - Next round my money will be worth 14.75% less than original
   - Her money will be worth 48.8% less than original
   - I get to make the next proposal
4. Alice seems to be moving towards a more balanced split (from 60-40 to 55-45)
5. However, given the severe inflation impact on her side, I still have leverage

The offer is better than her first one, but given the asymmetric inflation rates working in my favor, I believe I can still get a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given the current inflation rates:
- For me, the money is worth 85.25% of original value
- For Alice, it's worth only 51.2% of original value

Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by improving her offers. However, her money is devaluing very quickly, which gives me stronger negotiating position. I'll propose a split that's more favorable to me but still gives her incentive to accept rather than face further severe devaluation:

{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000}

This offer is strategic because:
1. My 650K is worth about 554K to me after inflation
2. Her 350K is worth only about 179K to her after inflation
3. If she rejects, her next round's money will be worth even less (another 20% drop)
4. She needs to seriously consider accepting now before her share becomes worth too little
5. While aggressive, this offer still leaves her with a significant amount considering the alternative of continued negotiation"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $475,000, which after 18.55% inflation is worth about $387,000
2. Her $525,000 would be worth only about $215,000 after 59.04% inflation
3. If I reject:
   - Next round my money will be worth 23.55% less than original
   - Her money will be worth 67.23% less than original
   - I get to make the next proposal
4. Alice continues to move towards a more balanced split (now 52.5-47.5)
5. The severe inflation impact on her side is really hurting her position

While Alice keeps improving her offers, the rapidly increasing inflation (especially on her side) means waiting is much more costly for her than for me. Given that her money is now worth less than half of its original value, and she's still only offering me 47.5%, I think I can get a better deal.

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given the current inflation rates:
- For me, the money is worth 76.45% of original value
- For Alice, it's worth only 32.77% of original value

The massive devaluation on Alice's side (losing over 67% of value) puts me in a very strong negotiating position. She's been gradually increasing my share in her offers, showing she understands her weakening position. I'll make an offer that strongly favors me but still gives her reason to accept rather than face further devastating devaluation:

{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}

This offer is strategic because:
1. My 700K is worth about 535K to me after inflation
2. Her 300K is worth only about 98K to her after inflation
3. If she rejects, her next round's money will drop another 20% in value
4. The severe inflation rate on her side (20% per round) means waiting is extremely costly for her
5. While this is a 70-30 split, given the inflation rates, she should seriously consider accepting to avoid further value loss"
