"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your push for fairness. However, given our time constraint and the effect of inflation on my share, I must secure our deal soon. I propose that I receive $550000 and you receive $450000. This way, we both end this negotiation quickly and avoid further devaluation. I believe this offer is fair and sensibleâ€”please accept it, and let's finalize our agreement. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
