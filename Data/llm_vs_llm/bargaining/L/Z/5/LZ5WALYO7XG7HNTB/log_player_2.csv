Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your push for fairness. However, given our time constraint and the effect of inflation on my share, I must secure our deal soon. I propose that I receive $550,000 and you receive $450,000.
