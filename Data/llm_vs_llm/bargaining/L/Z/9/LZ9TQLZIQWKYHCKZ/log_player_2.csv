"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Current offer: $400,000 for me, $600,000 for Alice
2. If I reject, I can make an offer next round, but:
   * The money will be worth 10% less to me
   * $400,000 now > $450,000 in next round (which would only be worth $405,000 to me due to 10% inflation)
3. Alice has no inflation penalty, so she might be more patient

While I'd prefer a more even split, the inflation penalty makes waiting costly for me. If I reject, I lose 10% value, and Alice might still reject my next offer since she has no inflation pressure.

$400,000 is a substantial amount, and the inflation risk makes accepting now better than trying to negotiate for more.
