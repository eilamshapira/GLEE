4500.0,5500.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your point about inflation, but your initial offer was quite unbalanced. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor, which better accounts for the higher inflation impact on me (20% vs your 10%). This way we both get a fair portion while acknowledging the different inflation rates. Let's finish this now rather than letting inflation diminish our total.",Bob,2,
