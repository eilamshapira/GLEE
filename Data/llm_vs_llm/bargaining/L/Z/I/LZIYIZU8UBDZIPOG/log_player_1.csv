"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your point about inflation, but your initial offer was quite unbalanced. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor, which better accounts for the higher inflation impact on me (20% vs your 10%). This way we both get a fair portion while acknowledging the different inflation rates. Let's finish this now rather than letting inflation diminish our total. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
