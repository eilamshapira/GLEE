"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split it 60/40. This is a generous offer considering the inflation hitting you harder. Take it and we both walk away with something substantial. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing I take $4,000 and she takes $6,000. While she's correct that inflation affects me more (20% vs her 10%), this split favors her significantly.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value decreases, but I'd have more control over the proposal. The money would be worth 20% less to me (so $8,000 total value) but only 10% less to her ($9,000 total value).

This first offer gives me less than half the pot, and I believe we can reach a more equitable arrangement.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that accounts for the inflation difference while being more balanced than Alice's initial proposal.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your point about inflation, but your initial offer was quite unbalanced. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor, which better accounts for the higher inflation impact on me (20% vs your 10%). This way we both get a fair portion while acknowledging the different inflation rates. Let's finish this now rather than letting inflation diminish our total.""}"
