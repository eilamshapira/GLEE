"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Based on a backward‐induction analysis of the alternating-offers game (with 12 rounds and a 5% “decay” of the available $ per round), the equilibrium turns out to be uneven because the final (12th) offer is made by Bob. (In such finite-horizon bargaining, the “responder” in the first round actually has a strong continuation value.) A sketch of the computation is as follows:

• Let P(r) = 10000 · (0.95)^(r–1) be the available money in round r.
• In round 12 (the last round) the proposer (Bob) can grab nearly all of P(12) = 10000 · (0.95)^11 while giving the responder an arbitrarily small amount.
• Working backward, in round 11 when Alice is the proposer the best she can do is to offer Bob just enough (namely, what he would almost surely secure as the proposer in round 12) and keep the “remainder.”
• Repeating this procedure (from rounds 11, 10, …, down to round 1) one finds that if both parties are fully rational and know the entire structure, the unique subgame‐perfect equilibrium has the following outcome in round 1:
  – Alice (the round‑1 proposer) gets about $2357.13,
  – Bob gets about $7642.87.

Thus, my offer in round 1 is to divide $10,000 as follows:

{""alice_gain"": 2357.13, ""bob_gain"": 7642.87}"
