"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing I get $40 while she gets $60. Since inflation affects Alice's value but not mine, I have some negotiating advantage. I could potentially get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair counteroffer considering the inflation factor that affects Alice but not me.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing an equal split of the money. This is a fair division that gives us both the same amount. Since inflation will reduce Alice's value by 5% each round, it's in her interest to reach an agreement soon rather than prolonging negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice Alice has improved her offer from $40 to $45 for me. This shows we're moving in the right direction. However, since inflation only affects Alice's value (now at 9.75% less) and not mine, I still have some negotiating leverage. I think we can reach a more favorable agreement if I make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a slightly more favorable offer for myself while still being reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'm proposing I receive $55 and Alice receives $45. This is a reasonable adjustment considering the inflation factor that only affects Alice. Since inflation reduces Alice's value by 5% each round (now approaching 15% less), reaching an agreement sooner rather than later benefits her significantly. This offer strikes a balance between our interests."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Alice has improved her offer again, now proposing $48 for me and $52 for her. The inflation effect on her share is becoming significant at 18.55% less value, while my value remains unchanged. We're getting closer to an agreement, but I think there's still room for a slightly better deal given the inflation asymmetry.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer that's slightly more favorable to me while acknowledging Alice's movement toward compromise.

{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48}

I'm proposing I receive $52 and Alice receives $48. This offer recognizes the progress we've made in our negotiations. Since inflation continues to reduce Alice's value (now at nearly 20% less), reaching an agreement in this round would be beneficial for both of us. My offer is only slightly better for me than Alice's last offer was for her, showing I'm willing to be reasonable and find middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is now offering an even 50-50 split. Given that we've gone through several rounds and the money is worth 26.49% less to her due to inflation while my value remains unchanged, this is a fair offer. I should accept this proposal to avoid further rounds where we both risk getting nothing if we can't reach an agreement by round 12.
