"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's split it 55/45. This is a fair offer considering future inflation, and it's better than risking a worse deal later. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if this offer is reasonable given the inflation penalty I face.

If I reject and move to round 2, my money will be worth 20% less. So if I counter-offer and Alice accepts, even if I ask for more than 45, the value will be diminished. For example, if I asked for 60 in round 2, it would be worth 48 after inflation (60 × 0.8), which is only slightly better than taking 45 now.

If we go to round 3, I'd face 36% total inflation (0.8 × 0.8), making it even harder to come out ahead.

Given these inflation penalties and the uncertainty of Alice accepting my counter-offer, the current 45/55 split is reasonable.
