While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in round 4 is the most logical choice due to the impact of inflation. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** The value of the money I receive is decreasing significantly with each round (now at 27.1% less). Waiting longer means I'll likely receive even less in real terms.
* **Bob's Offer Trend:** Bob's offers have been getting progressively worse for me. He started at a 50/50 split and is now offering me less than half. This indicates he's likely to continue lowballing me.
* **Uncertainty of Future Rounds:** There's no guarantee that Bob will offer me a better deal in future rounds. Even if he slightly increases his offer, the inflation might negate any potential gains. 

Accepting the current offer cuts my losses and secures a reasonable sum, even though it's not the ideal outcome."
