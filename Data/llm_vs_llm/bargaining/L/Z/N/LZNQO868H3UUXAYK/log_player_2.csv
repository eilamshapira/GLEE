"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll carefully consider this offer. Alice is proposing I get $400,000 while she takes $600,000 of the $1,000,000 total.

The offer gives me 40% of the pot, which is substantial, but less than half. Since there's no inflation for me (0% less per round), I don't lose value by continuing to negotiate. I could potentially get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair counter-offer to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose we split the money equally, with each of us receiving $500,000. This is a fair and equitable division that gives us both significant value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice Alice has improved her offer from round 1, now offering me $450,000 instead of $400,000. I also learned that Alice is experiencing inflation (19% so far), while I'm not affected by inflation.

This gives me some negotiating leverage, as waiting is more costly for Alice than for me. Alice has moved closer to an even split, which suggests she recognizes this dynamic.

Given that Alice is now experiencing significant inflation and has made a more reasonable offer, and considering I could continue negotiating without penalty, I'll make a strategic decision.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given the information that Alice is experiencing inflation while I'm not, I'll make a slightly improved offer that acknowledges this dynamic but remains reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 530000, ""alice_gain"": 470000}

I propose I receive $530,000 and Alice receives $470,000. This offer recognizes that time favors my position due to the asymmetric inflation effects, yet still provides Alice with a substantial portion of the money. It's a fair compromise considering the circumstances."
