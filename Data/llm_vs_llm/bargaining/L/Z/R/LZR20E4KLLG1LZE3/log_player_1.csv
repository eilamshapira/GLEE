"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair offer in the first round, considering that there's inflation that reduces the value by 5% each round for me.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose a 55-45 split in our favor. This is a fair offer that gives both of us a substantial portion of the money. I'm offering slightly more to myself because I'm making the first move, but I'm still giving you a significant share of $450,000. Let's avoid the effects of inflation and reach an agreement now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Now that I have more information about Bob's inflation rate (20% per round), I'll make a better strategic offer.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split. This is a completely fair division that gives us both equal shares. Since your inflation rate is much higher than mine (20% vs 5%), you have more incentive to accept this fair offer now rather than continuing to another round where your money would lose significantly more value. Let's settle this equitably and both walk away with $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that Bob has rejected my fair 50-50 split and is experiencing significant inflation (48.8% already), I need to adjust my offer strategically.

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}

I propose a 45-55 split in Bob's favor. Notice that I'm now offering Bob more than myself - $550,000 compared to my $450,000. This is a very generous offer considering that Bob's inflation rate is much higher than mine (20% per round vs my 5%). If we continue to another round, Bob's money will be worth even less due to the compounding 20% inflation. This offer gives Bob more absolute dollars and more value given our inflation rates. It's in both our interests to conclude this negotiation now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000
