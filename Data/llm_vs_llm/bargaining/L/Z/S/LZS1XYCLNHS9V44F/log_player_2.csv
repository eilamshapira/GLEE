"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, any amount I get next round will be worth 5% less
4. $40 now is better than $42.10 in the next round (due to inflation)
5. While I could try to negotiate for more, there's a risk of losing value through inflation or reaching round 12 with no agreement

{""decision"": ""accept""}

The offer is reasonable enough considering the inflation penalty, and it's better to secure a decent amount now than risk losing value in subsequent rounds."
