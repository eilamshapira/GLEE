100.0,0.0,"Bob, time is money – literally. Since your dollars lose 5% of value each round while mine don’t, delaying only hurts you. Accept this split, and let’s settle immediately.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
50.0,50.0,"Alice, since my money loses value each round, let's split it fairly at 50/50 now. This way, we both benefit before my share depreciates further.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
99.0,1.0,"Bob, I'm offering you $1 now. While it may seem small, if you reject, you'll be proposing next round—but your share will be even more hurt by depreciation, and given my stability and bargaining power, you'll end up with virtually nothing. Accept this offer now; it's better than waiting.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
60.0,40.0,"Alice, given the rapid depreciation of my share, I'm willing to accept less than 50/50 now. A 40/60 split in your favor is fair considering the circumstances, and it's better for both of us to end this soon.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
99.99,0.01,"Bob, every additional round further erodes the already limited value of your share. In round 5 your dollars count for only about 81% of their original worth. By accepting this proposal, you secure a positive gain, however small—far better than the near-zero returns you'd face in the next round. Let's settle now and avoid further losses.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
70.0,30.0,"Alice, my share is now worth significantly less due to inflation. I'm willing to take a 30/70 split in your favor to end this game. It's a better deal for you, and I still get something before it's worth even less.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
99.98,0.02,"Bob, every extra second we delay further erodes the value of your share. In round 8, as the proposer, you might try to claim more nominal value, but inflation will crush its real worth—even a 30 nominal share then would be a pittance in effective terms. Accept this offer now: you get $0.02 (worth more than if you wait), and I secure nearly the entire $100. It's the smarter move for both of us.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
80.0,20.0,"Alice, we're deep into this game now, and my share is losing value fast. I'm proposing a 20/80 split in your favor. It's a good deal for you, and I still get something before inflation makes it nearly worthless.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
90.0,10.0,"Bob, each passing round chips away at the real value of your share. If you hold out until round 10, you'll find yourself stuck with a nominal amount that's even more devalued—likely around $10, which in effective terms would be even less than what I'm offering now. Accept this 90/10 split; it secures you a better outcome right away and prevents further erosion of your gains.",Alice,9,
