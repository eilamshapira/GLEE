"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 100, ""bob_gain"": 0, ""message"": ""Bob, time is money – literally. Since your dollars lose 5% of value each round while mine don’t, delaying only hurts you. Accept this split, and let’s settle immediately.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, since my money loses value each round, let's split it fairly at 50/50 now. This way, we both benefit before my share depreciates further. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you $1 now. While it may seem small, if you reject, you'll be proposing next round—but your share will be even more hurt by depreciation, and given my stability and bargaining power, you'll end up with virtually nothing. Accept this offer now; it's better than waiting.""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, given the rapid depreciation of my share, I'm willing to accept less than 50/50 now. A 40/60 split in your favor is fair considering the circumstances, and it's better for both of us to end this soon.

In round 5 your dollars count for only about 81% of their original worth. By accepting this proposal, you secure a positive gain, however small—far better than the near-zero returns you'd face in the next round. Let's settle now and avoid further losses.""}"

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my share is now worth significantly less due to inflation. I'm willing to take a 30/70 split in your favor to end this game. It's a better deal for you, and I still get something before it's worth even less.

In round 8, as the proposer, you might try to claim more nominal value, but inflation will crush its real worth—even a 30 nominal share then would be a pittance in effective terms. Accept this offer now: you get $0.02 (worth more than if you wait), and I secure nearly the entire $100. It's the smarter move for both of us.""}"

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

Round 9

If you hold out until round 10, you'll find yourself stuck with a nominal amount that's even more devalued—likely around $10, which in effective terms would be even less than what I'm offering now. Accept this 90/10 split; it secures you a better outcome right away and prevents further erosion of your gains.""}"
