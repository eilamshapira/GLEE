"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a division that acknowledges both our interests while considering that Bob faces a 10% depreciation per round.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose I get $60 and Bob gets $40. This is a fair offer considering that if Bob rejects, the next round's $100 will be worth only $90 to him, while maintaining full value for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept, I get $40
2. If I reject, we go to round 3 where:
   - I can make a new offer
   - The $100 will be worth even less to Bob (80% of original value)
   - I maintain full value
   - This gives me stronger negotiating position

Since $40 is less than my initial offer and I know Bob's money loses value each round while mine doesn't, I'll reject this offer to negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's money is now worth 20% less (due to two rounds of 10% depreciation), I can make a stronger case for a more favorable split for me. Bob should be more inclined to accept since further delays will decrease the value more for him.

{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}

I propose I get $65 and Bob gets $35. This is reasonable because:
1. For Bob, $35 now is worth more than a larger amount in future rounds due to his 10% depreciation per round
2. I maintain full value of my share regardless of rounds
3. It's a slight increase from my previous offer, showing I'm firm in my position"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob is offering me $50, which is better than his previous offer of $40
2. This shows he's moving in my direction
3. However, Bob's money is now worth 27.1% less, meaning his $50 is only worth about $36.45 to him
4. If I reject, in the next round his money will be worth even less, strengthening my position
5. Given that my money maintains its value and I can likely get a better deal as Bob's value continues to decrease, I should reject

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that Bob's money has depreciated significantly (now worth about 34.4% less for him), and he's shown willingness to move up to $50 for me, I'll make a stronger offer that still gives him incentive to accept rather than face further depreciation.

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I propose I get $70 and Bob gets $30. This is strategic because:
1. For Bob, $30 now is worth about $19.68 in his value, but waiting will only make it worse for him
2. He's shown flexibility by moving to a 50-50 split last round
3. The decreasing value of money for Bob makes this more reasonable than it appears at face value
4. We still have 7 rounds left, but each round makes Bob's position weaker"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
1. Bob is offering me $60, which is another improvement from his previous offer of $50
2. However, I'm in a strong negotiating position because:
   - Bob's money is now worth 40.95% less to him
   - His $40 is only worth about $23.62 to him
   - I still have full value of my money
   - We have 6 rounds left
3. I previously offered 70-30 split, and with Bob's continuing depreciation, I can likely get an even better deal
4. The trend shows Bob is making increasingly better offers for me

{""decision"": ""reject""}

Let's see if he'll come up with an even better offer as his money continues to depreciate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","With Bob's money now worth about 47% less and seeing his gradual increase in offers to me (from 40 to 50 to 60), I'll push for an even better split.

{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}

I propose I get $75 and Bob gets $25. This is strategic because:
1. Bob's $25 is worth only about $13.25 to him now, and will be worth even less next round
2. He's shown a pattern of increasing offers (last offer was 60-40)
3. We're over halfway through the rounds (7 of 12)
4. The rapid depreciation of his money makes accepting sooner rather than later more rational for him
5. If he rejects, his negotiating position becomes even weaker in the next round"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
1. Bob is offering me $70, which is another improvement from his previous offer of $60
2. This matches my initial offer from several rounds ago
3. However:
   - Bob's money is now worth 52.17% less to him
   - His $30 is only worth about $14.35 to him
   - We still have 4 rounds left
   - I just offered a 75-25 split, and Bob's position continues to weaken
   - The trend shows Bob making increasingly better offers (40->50->60->70)

{""decision"": ""reject""}

Since Bob has shown willingness to increase his offers and his money continues to depreciate significantly, I'll reject and push for an even better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","With Bob's money now worth about 57% less and seeing his consistent pattern of increasing offers (most recently to 70-30), I'll push for an even better split.

{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}

I propose I get $80 and Bob gets $20. This is strategic because:
1. Bob's $20 would only be worth about $8.60 to him now, and will be worth even less next round
2. He's shown a clear pattern of increasing offers (40->50->60->70)
3. We're now in round 9 of 12, time pressure is building
4. His last offer was 70-30, showing he's willing to move significantly in my direction
5. The severe depreciation of his money (57%) makes accepting a smaller amount now more rational than waiting for a larger amount later
6. If he rejects, his negotiating position becomes even weaker with only 3 rounds remaining"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
1. Bob is offering me $75, another improvement from his previous offer of $70
2. However:
   - We only have 2 rounds left after this
   - Bob's money is now worth 61.26% less to him
   - His $25 is only worth about $9.69 to him
   - I just offered an 80-20 split
   - Bob has consistently increased his offers (40->50->60->70->75)
   - With such severe depreciation and few rounds left, his position is very weak

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject because:
1. The pattern suggests Bob will likely offer even more next round
2. His money will be worth even less next round
3. With only 2 rounds left and such severe depreciation, he's under pressure to make a deal
4. I can likely get closer to my last proposed 80-20 split"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","With only 2 rounds remaining, Bob's money now worth about 65% less, and his last offer being 75-25, I'll make a firm push for an even better split.

{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}

I propose I get $85 and Bob gets $15. This is strategic because:
1. We're in the penultimate round - only one round left after this
2. Bob's $15 would be worth only about $5.25 to him now
3. If we don't reach an agreement in the next round, we both get nothing
4. Bob has shown consistent willingness to increase his offers (40->50->60->70->75)
5. The extreme depreciation of his money (65%) and the threat of getting nothing should make accepting a smaller amount now more attractive than risking the final round
6. His last offer of 75-25 shows he's willing to accept a much smaller share than initially"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 68.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this final offer carefully:
1. This is the last round - if I reject, we both get nothing
2. Bob is offering me $80, which is very close to my last offer of 85-15
3. Bob's money is worth 68.62% less to him, so his $20 is only worth about $6.28 to him
4. Getting $80 is much better than getting nothing

Given that:
- This is the final round
- The offer is quite good (80-20)
- The alternative is getting nothing
- Bob has moved significantly from his initial positions

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While I might have preferred my last proposed split of 85-15, getting $80 is much better than risking getting nothing, and it's still a very good outcome given where we started."
