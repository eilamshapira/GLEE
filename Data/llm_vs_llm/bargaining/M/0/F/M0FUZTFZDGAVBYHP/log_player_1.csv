While I could push for a slightly higher gain in later rounds, accepting a 50/50 split now makes strategic sense:

* **Inflation Impact:**  The longer the game goes on, the less valuable Bob's potential offers become to him due to inflation. This makes him more likely to accept a deal closer to even as time goes on.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a slightly better deal carries the risk that Bob might become increasingly desperate and offer even less favorable terms. 
* **Fairness:** A 50/50 split is inherently fair, and establishes a sense of goodwill that could be beneficial in future interactions (hypothetically). 

In short, while a slightly better outcome might be possible, the certainty and relative fairness of the current offer make it a reasonable deal to accept."
