600000.0,400000.0,I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair starting offer considering the impact of inflation on me.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
1.0,999999.0,"Alice, I know the stakes are high—but delaying further will only hurt your position even more. Remember, after this round your money loses 20% of its value. Accept this offer and secure your share, however small it may seem compared to what waiting would cost you.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Let's split it evenly this time. Considering the inflation impact on me, this is a fair deal for both of us.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
1.0,999999.0,"Alice, waiting until round 5 will further erode the value of your share – by then, each dollar will be worth only about 40.96% to you, and as the proposer you'll be forced to offer Bob almost everything to get his acceptance. In this round, I'm giving you a token amount so that you recover at least something. Accept this offer now rather than risk ending up with virtually nothing.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
100000.0,900000.0,"I'll take a smaller share to reach an agreement. This way, we both get something reasonable.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
1.0,999999.0,"Alice, any further delay will only diminish the value of your share even more. In round 7 when you propose, you'll be forced to offer Bob nearly everything to get his acceptance, leaving you virtually nothing. I'm offering you $1 now, which—even after a 67.23% discount—gives you a positive value, whereas waiting will yield practically zero. Accept this offer to secure something rather than nothing.",Bob,6,
