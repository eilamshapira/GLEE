Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know the stakes are high—but delaying further will only hurt your position even more. Remember, after this round your money loses 20% of its value. Accept this offer and secure your share, however small it may seem compared to what waiting would cost you.

# Bob gain: 999999

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, waiting until round 5 will further erode the value of your share – by then, each dollar will be worth only about 40.96% to you, and as the proposer you'll be forced to offer Bob almost everything to get his acceptance. In this round, I'm giving you a token amount so that you recover at least something. Accept this offer now rather than risk ending up with virtually nothing. 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, any further delay will only diminish the value of your share even more. In round 7 when you propose, you'll be forced to offer Bob nearly everything to get his acceptance, leaving you virtually nothing. I'm offering you $1 now, which—even after a 67.23% discount—gives you a positive value, whereas waiting will yield practically zero. Accept this offer to secure something rather than nothing.

# Bob gain: 999999
