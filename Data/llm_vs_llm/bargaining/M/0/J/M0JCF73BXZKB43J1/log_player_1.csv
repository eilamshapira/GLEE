"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer to Bob for dividing the $1,000,000.

Given that inflation reduces my value by 20% per round and Bob's by 10% per round, we should consider the time pressure. I want to make a fair offer that Bob would likely accept to avoid multiple rounds of negotiation.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering a slightly favorable split for myself, but still giving Bob a substantial share. This is a reasonable first offer considering we both face declining values with each round, and I face a steeper decline."
