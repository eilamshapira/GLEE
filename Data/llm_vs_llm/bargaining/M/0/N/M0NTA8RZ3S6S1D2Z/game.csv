600000.0,400000.0,"Alice, given the time‐sensitivity on my side (money depreciates by 10% each round), it's in our mutual interest to settle now rather than risk further discounting. I'm proposing we stick with the 40/60 split, which is exactly what you initially suggested. I believe this is a fair, expedient resolution—let's agree and wrap this up!",Bob,2,
