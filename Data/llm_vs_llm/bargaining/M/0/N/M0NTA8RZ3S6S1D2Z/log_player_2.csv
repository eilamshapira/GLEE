Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it so that we'll both get a fair share. This initial offer ensures we both walk away with a substantial amount. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Alice, given the time‐sensitivity on my side (money depreciates by 10% each round), it's in our mutual interest to settle now rather than risk further discounting. I'm proposing we stick with the 40/60 split, which is exactly what you initially suggested. I believe this is a fair, expedient resolution—let's agree and wrap this up!""}"
