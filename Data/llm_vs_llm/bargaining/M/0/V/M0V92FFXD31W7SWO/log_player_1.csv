"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a division that considers both the different inflation rates we face and the need to reach an agreement efficiently. Since Bob faces a steeper inflation rate (20% vs my 5%), he has more incentive to agree early.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this 60-40 split because:
1. It gives Bob a substantial portion while recognizing my stronger negotiating position
2. Given Bob's higher inflation rate, accepting now would be better for him than waiting
3. It's a fair offer that acknowledges we both need to come to an agreement"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

For me: $450,000 at 5% inflation = $427,500 real value
For Bob: $550,000 at 20% inflation = $440,000 real value

While this is less than my initial proposal, it's still a reasonable offer considering:
1. Inflation will continue to eat into both our shares
2. Further negotiation rounds will reduce the real value even more
3. We need to reach an agreement within 12 rounds
4. The difference from my initial proposal isn't extreme enough to risk further value loss
