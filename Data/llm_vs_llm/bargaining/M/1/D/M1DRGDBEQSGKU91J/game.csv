900000.0,100000.0,"Let's start fair, I'll take a bigger share, but you still get something. We can work out a better deal later.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, considering the ticking clock and potential inflation risks (which might affect your share more than mine), I propose a division that secures both our interests today. You get $400000 and I keep $600000. Let's avoid devaluation and finalize this deal now.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Let's split it down the middle.  This ensures we both get a fair share, and we don't have to worry about further inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
475000.0,525000.0,"Alice, every extra round further erodes the value of the money you receive, while my share remains unaffected. Although this split is only slightly off the 50/50 mark nominally, acting now secures you a higher effective value than waiting and risking further devaluation. I propose that I take $525000 and you get $475000. Accepting this deal ensures you don’t lose more to inflation in future rounds.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"I understand your point about inflation, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share, but I need to make sure it's still fair.  Let's split it closer to 55/45, and get this done.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, every extra round further erodes the value of your share while my take remains intact. By agreeing now—with me taking 600K and you 400K—you avoid additional inflation penalties on your end. This offer secures your effective value far better than risking further rounds. Let's finalize this deal and stop the depreciation.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"I'm getting increasingly concerned about the inflation impact.  I think it's time we compromise.  Let's split it at 45/55.  This ensures we both get a reasonable share, and we can finally move on from this negotiation.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
375000.0,625000.0,"Alice, notice that with every round, your share loses even more of its real value due to inflation—much more than mine. Delaying the agreement only deepens the effective loss on your side. I'm offering a split of 625K for me and 375K for you, which secures the current value of your share before further depreciation sets in. This is your best chance to minimize the impact of inflation on your earnings. Let's finalize this deal and stop the downward spiral.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Bob, we're running out of time.  I'm willing to take a smaller share, but I need to see some movement from you.  Let's go with a 40/60 split and end this.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"Alice, I know the clock is ticking and every additional round further erodes the real value of the money you’d receive. If we don’t settle now, your share will take an even harder hit in effective value. I'm offering you $350000 now—while my share remains at full value—to give you the best possible outcome before the next round's additional depreciation. Let's finalize this deal so you don't lose even more to inflation.",Bob,10,
