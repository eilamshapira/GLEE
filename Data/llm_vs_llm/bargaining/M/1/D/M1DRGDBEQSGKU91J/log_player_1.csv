# Bob's message: Alice, considering the ticking clock and potential inflation risks (which might affect your share more than mine), I propose a division that secures both our interests today. You get $400000 and I keep $600000. Let's avoid devaluation and finalize this deal now.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every extra round further erodes the value of the money you receive, while my share remains unaffected. Although this split is only slightly off the 50/50 mark nominally, acting now secures you a higher effective value than waiting and risking further devaluation. I propose that I take $525000 and you get $475000. Accepting this deal ensures you don’t lose more to inflation in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 475000

Round 8

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, notice that with every round, your share loses even more of its real value due to inflation—much more than mine. Delaying the agreement only deepens the effective loss on your side. I'm offering a split of 625K for me and 375K for you, which secures the current value of your share before further depreciation sets in. This is your best chance to minimize the impact of inflation on your earnings. Let's finalize this deal and stop the downward spiral.
