"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my initial offer to divide the $1,000,000 between Bob and myself.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose a slightly higher share for myself since I know that inflation will reduce the value of my portion by 5% each round if we continue negotiating. A quick resolution benefits both of us, and this division gives Bob a substantial portion while accounting for my inflation concern."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer that considers the inflation effect I'm experiencing.

{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000}

I'm adjusting my offer to be more favorable to Bob while still giving myself a reasonable share. With inflation reducing my money's value by 5% each round, I'm seeking a quicker resolution that works for both of us. This is a fair compromise where we both get a substantial portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
