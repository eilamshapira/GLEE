"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let me think about this. Since I'm playing as Alice, I need to consider how to divide $100 between Bob and myself. With each passing round, the money doesn't lose value for me, but it loses 10% value for Bob. This means Bob has an incentive to accept offers earlier rather than later.

For my first offer, I'll propose a division that's somewhat favorable to me but still reasonable enough that Bob might accept it rather than waiting for the next round.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering Bob $40 out of the $100. If Bob rejects this and we go to the next round, the $100 will still be worth $100 to me, but it will only be worth $90 to Bob."
