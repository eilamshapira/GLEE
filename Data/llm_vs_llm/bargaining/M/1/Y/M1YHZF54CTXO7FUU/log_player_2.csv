"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer of $40 for me and $60 for her, or reject it and make a counter-offer in the next round.

If I reject, I can make my own offer next round, but the money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation. That means the $100 total would effectively be worth only $80 to me in the next round.

Alice's current offer gives me $40, which is less than half but still a significant portion. If I reject and counter-offer in the next round, even if I asked for more (say $60), it would only be worth $48 to me after inflation.

Given the inflation penalty, it seems reasonable to accept this offer now rather than risk getting less effective value in later rounds.
