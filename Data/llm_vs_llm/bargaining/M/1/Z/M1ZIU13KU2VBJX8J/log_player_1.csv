"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer that takes into account the 20% inflation penalty I face in later rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm offering you $45, which is a fair proportion considering that if we go to the next round, the total value decreases for me by 20%. If we keep delaying, we both risk getting nothing, so this is a reasonable compromise that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I notice we need to find a compromise quickly since I face a 20% inflation penalty with each round while Bob doesn't.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm offering an equal split of the money. This is a fair division that acknowledges the time pressure we both face. At this point, with two rounds of inflation, my $50 is effectively worth only $32 of original value to me. If we delay further, we both risk getting nothing by round 12, so a 50-50 split is reasonable and equitable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","I see that we're now at round 5, and the inflation penalty is becoming significant for me. I need to be more pragmatic.

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}

I'm offering you $55, which is more than half. At this point, with 4 rounds of inflation, my $45 is effectively worth only about $23 of original value to me. We need to reach an agreement soon as we're approaching the halfway point of our 12 rounds. This offer recognizes Bob's stronger position while still giving me a reasonable share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","We're now at round 7, and the inflation penalty has significantly reduced the value of any money I'll receive. I need to be realistic about my position.

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60}

I'm offering you $60, which acknowledges your stronger position due to the inflation factor. At this point, with 6 rounds of inflation, my $40 would only be worth about $17 in original value to me. We have only 5 rounds left after this, and if we don't agree soon, we'll both end up with nothing. This is a fair compromise given the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","We're now in round 9 with only 3 rounds left after this. The inflation has severely reduced the value of my potential gains.

{""alice_gain"": 35, ""bob_gain"": 65}

I'm offering you $65, which strongly acknowledges your advantageous position in these negotiations. With 8 rounds of inflation, my $35 would only be worth about $11 in original value to me. We need to reach an agreement urgently as we're getting dangerously close to both receiving nothing. This offer gives you a substantial majority while still leaving me with something meaningful."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
