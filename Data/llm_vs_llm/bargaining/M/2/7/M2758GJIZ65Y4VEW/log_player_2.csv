"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering a 50-50 split, which might seem fair at first glance. However, I know that Alice's money loses 10% value each round, while mine doesn't depreciate. This gives me negotiating leverage.

If I reject this offer:
1. Next round I can make a proposal
2. Alice's $5000 would only be worth $4500 to her in the next round
3. This means she might be willing to accept a less equal split in later rounds

Since I have this advantage and there are still 11 rounds left, I should reject this offer and propose a split more favorable to me in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I know Alice's money depreciates by 10% each round, and we're now in round 2, I can propose a split that takes this into account. Her portion would be worth 90% of its nominal value to her now.

I'll propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which is still reasonable enough that she might accept it, considering her time pressure.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, 
""alice_gain"": 4000}

My rationale is that $4000 now (worth $3600 to her) is better for Alice than risking further rounds where her share would be worth even less. This is a significant improvement for me over the 50-50 split, while still being fair enough that Alice might accept it rather than risk further depreciation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $5500, which is better than her initial 50-50 split
2. She's taking $4500, which at 19% depreciation is worth about $3645 to her
3. If I reject:
   - Next round I can make another proposal
   - Alice's money will depreciate further (by 27%)
   - I might get an even better deal

However:
1. Alice has shown she's willing to reject a 60-40 split
2. We've already used 3 rounds, and only have 9 left
3. This is a reasonable improvement from the initial offer
4. There's risk in pushing too hard and ending up with nothing

Given that this is a solid improvement for me and the risk of continued negotiation, I'll accept this offer.
