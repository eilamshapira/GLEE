Additionally, please remind Alice that if we don't reach an agreement by round 12, neither of us will get anything, and that would be unfortunate for both of us. We should aim to find a middle ground that works for both parties."

# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice seems to be disregarding the impact of inflation on her shares. She is trying to take advantage of the situation by offering me less than half of the money even though her money is worth less than mine. I will continue to negotiate for a fair share."

Round 6

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm making a final push for a fair deal. 56-44 is as low as I'll go. Inflation is killing my share, let's end this 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice's share is decreasing in value due to inflation, and she seems more willing to negotiate now. This offer is reasonable, and it's better to secure a deal now rather than risking no agreement at all. Let's accept this offer and end the game."
