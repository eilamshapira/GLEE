"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice has proposed a 50-50 split of the $10,000. While this seems fair at first glance, I need to consider the asymmetric inflation rates. If I reject and we go to another round, the money will be worth 20% less to me but only 10% less to Alice.

If I reject, the total amount remains $10,000, but its value to me in the next round would only be $8,000, while for Alice it would be $9,000. This means I'd need to get more than $5,000 in the next round just to break even with this current offer.

Since I can make the next proposal if I reject, I could potentially get more. However, Alice could then reject my proposal, and we'd enter a cycle of diminishing returns due to the inflation rates.
