Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness, Alice, but I think we can both do a little better. How about we flip the script and I take 550k, leaving you with 450k? Let's see if we can reach an agreement before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000
