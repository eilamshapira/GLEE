168626.49,831373.51,"Hi Bob, I propose we settle in Round 1. Based on our future prospects—taking into account that every round delays significantly hurt my share (−20% per round) while yours drop only modestly (−5% per round)—waiting will only diminish our overall gains. In fact, if we let this bargaining continue, rigorous backward‐induction analysis (up to Round 12) shows that by Round 2 you’d be guaranteed around $875000 nominally, which—discounting one round by 5%—yields roughly $831373.51 in today’s value. Therefore, I’m offering you exactly that amount now, leaving me with $168626.49. I believe this is a fair, rational compromise that protects both our interests. Let’s lock this in and avoid further value erosion.",Alice,1,

80000.0,920000.0,"Alice, your logic is sound, but you're undervaluing my position.  While later rounds would indeed favor me, they also risk a total loss for both of us. Let's be pragmatic - I'm proposing a larger share, reflecting my stronger position as the rounds progress. This ensures you get something substantial NOW, which is better than the shrinking pot later.  Deal?",Bob,2,

207464.0,792536.0,"Hi Bob, in Round 3 I’m proposing a division based on our future bargaining power. If you reject this offer, you'll be the proposer in Round 4, but by then your gains will be discounted by another 5%, while mine drop by 20%. In equilibrium, you’d expect an effective payoff of roughly $715000 if you wait. My offer gives you exactly that: $792536 nominal, which at your Round 3 discount factor (0.9025) is about $715000 in real terms. I would receive $207464 nominal (worth about $207464 × 0.64 ≈ $132777 for me). This split reflects the discounted future values and ensures we can both end the game now before further erosion occurs. Let’s settle now for a mutually rational outcome.",Alice,3,

90000.0,910000.0,"Alice, I appreciate your attempts at a 'rational' split, but it seems you're overestimating your leverage.  Each round that passes makes your position significantly weaker, a fact reflected in my offer. While this is a slight decrease from my last offer, it's far more generous than your dwindling prospects in later rounds. Time is literally money, and right now, the clock is working against you.",Bob,4,
,,"Hi Bob - thanks for the offer. Given that my share, once adjusted for Round 4’s inflation (receiving 90000 nominal is worth 90000 × 0.512 ≈ 46080 in today’s value for me), is already playing catch‐up with the rapidly eroding future value if we move to another round, I believe acceptance is in my best interest. Waiting another round would mean an even lower effective multiplier (around 0.4096 for me in Round 5), which makes it less attractive from my side. I agree that time is money – and at this stage, locking in 46080 effective value is better than jeopardizing my payoff further. I’m ready to settle on these terms.",Alice,4,accept
