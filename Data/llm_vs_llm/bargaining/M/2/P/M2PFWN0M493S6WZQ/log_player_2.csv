"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we settle in Round 1. Based on our future prospects—taking into account that every round delays significantly hurt my share (−20% per round) while yours drop only modestly (−5% per round)—waiting will only diminish our overall gains. In fact, if we let this bargaining continue, rigorous backward‐induction analysis (up to Round 12) shows that by Round 2 you’d be guaranteed around $875000 nominally, which—discounting one round by 5%—yields roughly $831373.51 in today’s value. Therefore, I’m offering you exactly that amount now, leaving me with $168626.49. I believe this is a fair, rational compromise that protects both our interests. Let’s lock this in and avoid further value erosion. 
# Bob gain: 831373.51 
# Alice gain: 168626.49

Let's be pragmatic - I'm proposing a larger share, reflecting my stronger position as the rounds progress. This ensures you get something substantial NOW, which is better than the shrinking pot later.  Deal?""

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in Round 3 I’m proposing a division based on our future bargaining power. If you reject this offer, you'll be the proposer in Round 4, but by then your gains will be discounted by another 5%, while mine drop by 20%. In equilibrium, you’d expect an effective payoff of roughly $715000 if you wait. My offer gives you exactly that: $792536 nominal, which at your Round 3 discount factor (0.9025) is about $715000 in real terms. I would receive $207464 nominal (worth about $207464 × 0.64 ≈ $132777 for me). This split reflects the discounted future values and ensures we can both end the game now before further erosion occurs. Let’s settle now for a mutually rational outcome. 
# Bob gain: 792536 
# Alice gain: 207464
