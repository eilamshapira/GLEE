"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}

I propose this split as a reasonable starting point that gives both of us a substantial portion while maintaining fairness. Since we're better off reaching an agreement quickly due to the 10% inflation penalty per round, this offer should be attractive to Bob."
