"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering me $4800 out of the $10,000, which is slightly less than half. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the total value will decrease by 10% to $9,000. 

This is a reasonable first offer. While I could try to negotiate for more, the risk of continued depreciation means we'd both lose value in further rounds. Since Alice's offer is close to an even split, I'll accept it.
