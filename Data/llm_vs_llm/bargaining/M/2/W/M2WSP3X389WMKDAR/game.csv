0.0,10000.0,"Hi Bob, to avoid any delays (which further devalue my share by 5% each round), I’m proposing you take the full $10000 now. I know that if we go to later rounds, your position only strengthens since your money doesn’t depreciate while mine does. I hope you see that accepting this now is mutually optimal.",Alice,1,

4000.0,6000.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns about inflation. Here's my offer: I'll take $6000 and you take $4000. This way, you still gain something while I ensure I have a solid amount. I hope you consider it!",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, thank you for this proposal. Given that every subsequent round reduces my share’s value by 5% and considering the potential strategic risks of prolonging the game, I believe it’s in my best interest to accept your offer now. I look forward to concluding our deal.",Alice,2,accept
