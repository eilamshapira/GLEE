"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 0, ""bob_gain"": 10000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, to avoid any delays (which further devalue my share by 5% each round), I’m proposing you take the full $10,000 now. I know that if we go to later rounds, your position only strengthens since your money doesn’t depreciate while mine does. I hope you see that accepting this now is mutually optimal.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns about inflation. Here's my offer: I'll take $6000 and you take $4000. This way, you still gain something while I ensure I have a solid amount. I hope you consider it! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for this proposal. Given that every subsequent round reduces my share’s value by 5% and considering the potential strategic risks of prolonging the game, I believe it’s in my best interest to accept your offer now. I look forward to concluding our deal.""}"
