"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to avoid any delays (which further devalue my share by 5% each round), I’m proposing you take the full $10000 now. I know that if we go to later rounds, your position only strengthens since your money doesn’t depreciate while mine does. I hope you see that accepting this now is mutually optimal. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
