"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically.

Alice is offering me $450,000 out of $1,000,000, which is 45% of the total amount. This is slightly less than an equal split, but it's still a substantial amount. 

Advantages of accepting:
1. I secure a large sum immediately
2. No risk of losing everything if negotiations fail after 12 rounds
3. No risk of getting a worse offer later

Advantages of rejecting:
1. I could potentially negotiate for a more equal split
2. I would get to make the next proposal

Given that:
- The offer is reasonably fair (close to 50-50)
- There's no inflation effect for me
- There's risk in prolonged negotiation
- I don't know Alice's inflation rate

I think it's wise to accept this offer. While not perfect, it's a good enough deal that the risks of rejection outweigh the potential benefits.
