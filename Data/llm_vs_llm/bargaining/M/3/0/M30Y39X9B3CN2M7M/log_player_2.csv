"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's keep it simple. I believe this is a fair division. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $2000 out of $10,000, which is only 20% of the total
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, the money will be worth less next round
4. $2000 now vs making a better offer next round where everything is worth 5% less

This offer is too low - even with inflation, I can likely get a better deal by making a counter-offer next round. The 5% inflation would only reduce $5000 by $250, for example, which would still be much better than accepting $2000 now.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer while accounting for the inflation factor:

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. This way we both benefit equally, and we can avoid further rounds where inflation will reduce the value for both of us.""}

This is a reasonable proposal because:
1. It's an equal split which is traditionally seen as fair
2. If Alice rejects, she'll face 5% inflation in the next round
3. It's a significant improvement from her initial low-ball offer
4. It demonstrates willingness to be fair rather than retaliating with an extreme counter-offer"
