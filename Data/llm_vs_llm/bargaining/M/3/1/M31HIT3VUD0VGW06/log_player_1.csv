"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

My reasoning: I'm starting with a slight advantage, hoping to secure a decent amount before inflation hits too hard. This offer gives Bob a reasonable amount, hopefully enough to accept it and avoid further losses for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this offer.

*   **Bob's offer:** Alice gets $45, Bob gets $55.
*   **Inflation:** My money is worth 20% less, and Bob's money is worth 10% less.

Let's consider the value after inflation:

*   Alice's perceived value: $45 * (1 - 0.20) = $36
*   Bob's perceived value: $55 * (1 - 0.10) = $49.50

While Bob is getting more in nominal dollars, his perceived value is still only slightly higher than mine. I will take it.
