"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: I get $40, Alice gets $60
2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make an offer
   * My money will be worth 10% less
   * Alice's money will be worth 20% less
   * This means a $100 split next round is effectively worth $90 to me and $80 to Alice

Since I can make the next offer and Alice will be under more time pressure (20% loss vs my 10%), I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. The current 40/60 split is not favorable enough.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice faces a steeper penalty for delay (20% vs my 10%), and she knows that if she rejects, we'll go to round 3 where the money will be worth even less, I'll propose a more favorable split for me, but still reasonable enough that she should accept.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

My reasoning: If Alice rejects this, in the next round the $100 will be worth $72 to her (after 20% reduction) and $81 to me (after 10% reduction). This makes accepting my current 55/45 split more attractive than risking another round."
