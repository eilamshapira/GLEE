"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair but advantageous offer for myself, considering the 20% inflation penalty per round.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose that I receive $600,000 and you receive $400,000. This is a reasonable offer given that I face a 20% inflation penalty for each round we delay, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
