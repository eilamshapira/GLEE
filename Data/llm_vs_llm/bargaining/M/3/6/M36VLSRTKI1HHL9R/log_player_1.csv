"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 51,
  ""bob_gain"": 49
}
```

My reasoning: I'm offering slightly more to myself, but still a very fair split to ensure Bob accepts in the first round. This avoids the risk of further rounds and the loss of value due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to calculate the actual value of Bob's offer to me, taking into account the 10% inflation.

$45 in Round 2 is worth $45 / 1.1 = $40.91 in Round 1 terms.

Since I was initially hoping for $51 and now he is offering effectively $40.91, I will reject the offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, it's my turn again. Remembering the inflation and wanting to get this settled soon, I'll offer a bit more to Bob this time, while still getting a decent amount for myself.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 48,
  ""bob_gain"": 52
}
```"
