"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. I want to be strategic and account for the inflation in future rounds. My offer in this first round is:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, hoping he'll find it acceptable rather than risk a lower value in future rounds due to inflation. I'm keeping $60 for myself, which I think is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. The value of the money has decreased. Bob's offer is now 50/50. Let's calculate the value I'd be getting relative to round 1.

50 (current value) / (100 * 0.8) (round 1 equivalent) = 0.625

So, accepting this offer is equivalent to accepting $62.50 in round 1 terms. That's better than my initial offer to Bob, and it's a split I can live with.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
