"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a fair start. I believe this division is a good balance for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully given the inflation factor.

Alice is offering me $200,000 out of $1,000,000, which is 20% of the total sum. While this isn't an equal split, I need to consider that rejecting means facing 10% inflation in the next round. If I reject, the money will effectively be worth $900,000 total in the next round.

If I make a counter-offer in round 2, Alice could reject it, and we'd face further inflation. Given we have a limited number of rounds and the risk of getting nothing if we can't agree, I should consider whether this initial offer is reasonable.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I need to make a reasonable counteroffer that acknowledges the inflation pressure while seeking a more equitable split than 20/80.

{""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking for a more balanced split. This proposal gives you the majority while still being fair to both of us. Remember that with inflation, delaying agreement reduces the total value for both of us, so it's in our mutual interest to reach a deal soon.""}"
