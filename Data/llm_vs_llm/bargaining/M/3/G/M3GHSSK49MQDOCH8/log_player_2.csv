"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Alice is offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance. However, I know that:
1. If I reject now, I can make my own offer next round
2. Alice's money devalues more slowly (5% per round) than mine (20% per round)
3. Due to this difference in devaluation rates, Alice might be more patient

If I reject and propose in the next round, my $50 would be worth $40 (20% less), while Alice's would be worth $47.50 (5% less).

Given the significant devaluation rate for my share and the fair initial offer, I should accept this proposal.
