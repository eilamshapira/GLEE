"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Let's see if Alice can do better in the next round. Since the value of the money decreases more for me with each round, I have more to lose from prolonged negotiations. However, I'm willing to take a risk to see if Alice will offer me more than $5,000 in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

With this offer, I'm asking for more than Alice's initial offer, but still leaving a substantial amount for Alice. Let's see if Alice will accept this or make a counteroffer in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5400 
# Alice gain: 4600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Although the value of the money has decreased for me, I think it's better to accept Alice's offer this round. If I reject this offer, the value of the money will continue to decrease more for me than for Alice with each passing round. Additionally, there's no guarantee that Alice will offer me more in subsequent rounds. Therefore, I'll accept this offer to secure my $5400."
