"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. This is my first offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

My reasoning:

*   I am aiming for a fair split that takes into account my perceived advantage as the proposer in the first round.
*   I'm offering Bob a significant amount to incentivize him to accept, especially considering the rapid depreciation of the money for him.
*   This offer gives me a slight edge but should still be appealing to Bob considering the consequences of rejecting it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Here's my response, taking into account the inflation:

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Reasoning:

*   **Inflation Impact:** The initial $1,000,000 is now worth less to both of us. For me, it's worth 5% less than before and for Bob it is worth 10% less than before.
*   **Bob's Offer:** Bob is offering me $450,000.
*   **Alternative:** Rejecting the offer means I will be making the offer in the next round and the money will depreciate another 5% for me and another 10% for Bob. However, accepting this offer is not the optimal decision. I believe there is a better chance for me to reach an agreement with Bob at the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000
}
```

Reasoning:

*   **Inflation Consideration:** The money is continuously depreciating. This significantly impacts Bob, making a slightly more generous offer more appealing.
*   **Adjusted Offer:** I am decreasing my share slightly from my initial offer in Round 1 ($550,000) to $520,000. This reflects the decreasing value of the money, and incentivizes Bob to accept, given his higher depreciation rate.
*   **Maintaining Leverage:** While I'm giving more to Bob, I'm still maintaining a larger portion, recognizing the limited rounds and the increasing pressure. I'm also factoring in that he rejected my initial offer, indicating he's willing to risk further depreciation to get a better deal. This offer is a balance between being fair and maximizing my potential gain."
