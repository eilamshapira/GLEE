"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be a little more even this time.  I'm willing to give you a bit more than 50% 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the 20% inflation, the actual values would be:
Alice gain: 450000 * 0.8 = 360000
Bob gain: 550000 * 0.8 = 440000

I don't think this is a good deal for me. I'll reject it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the 20% inflation in each round, the money is now worth 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 of its original value.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 520000, 
""bob_gain"": 480000, 
""message"": ""Let's aim for a more even split, considering the decreasing value""}"
