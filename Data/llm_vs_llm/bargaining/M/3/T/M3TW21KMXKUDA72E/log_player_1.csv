"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair since you face 5% inflation per round - if you reject, your share will be worth less next time.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your point about the inflation, but I think a more even split is fair. How about 55-45? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
- If I accept: I get $45
- If I reject: I can make a new offer next round
  * But Bob's money will be worth 5% less again
  * This means I could potentially negotiate a better deal since Bob is more pressured by time
  * My previous 60-40 offer was rejected, but Bob came back with a reasonable counter
  * Bob acknowledged the inflation factor

While I could reject and try to get more, Bob has shown willingness to negotiate fairly. There's also risk in prolonging negotiations.
