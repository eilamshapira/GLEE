"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more to avoid risk from inflation, but you still get a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, Alice, but let's not drag this out. A fair deal for both of us right now.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's meet in the middle. My turn to be generous, but this is as low as I can go. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation.  While my offer in Round 2 was generous, accepting a worse deal now sets a bad precedent. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to get a more equitable split, even with inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 520000,
""alice_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is a compromise. We're both losing out due to inflation the longer this goes on.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm slightly lowering my ask to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a larger share due to the inflation risk.  The message emphasizes that dragging this out hurts both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  A straight 50/50 split is the only fair deal at this point.  Any more rounds and we're both just losing money. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is finally showing some willingness to compromise, and while a 50/50 split isn't ideal, the effects of inflation are becoming increasingly significant.  It's better to secure a reasonable amount now than risk getting even less later on, especially since there's no guarantee Alice will offer anything better."
