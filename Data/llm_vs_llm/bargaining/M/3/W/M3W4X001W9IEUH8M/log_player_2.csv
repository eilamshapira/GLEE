"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take $6000, you get $4000.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly down the middle. A fair deal for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a fair deal, but I need to account for the decreasing value. How about $5500 for me and $4500 for you? 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

I need to push for a better deal still. While the money is losing value, accepting a deal where I get significantly less than half isn't ideal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Time is running out and the value is dropping. This is my final offer for a reasonable split.""}"
