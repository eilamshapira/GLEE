"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects a good balance for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully, given that I lose 5% of value with each round if I reject.

Alice is proposing I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000. This is a 40/60 split in her favor. If I reject, the total amount stays the same, but my purchasing power decreases by 5% per round.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the $10,000 would be worth 5% less to me, meaning the entire pot is effectively worth $9,500 from my perspective. Even if I proposed a more favorable split next round, I'd need to consider this depreciation.

Given that we have 12 rounds total but my money loses value each round, and considering Alice opened with a substantial offer of $4,000, I'll accept this initial proposal rather than risk further negotiations with diminishing returns.
