"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose we split the money 60-40, with me taking $600,000 and you taking $400,000. Since inflation affects me more significantly (20% per round versus your 5%), this slightly higher split for me helps offset that disadvantage while still giving you a substantial portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000}

I propose a 58-42 split, with me taking $580,000 and you taking $420,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, giving you more while still accounting for the fact that inflation affects me much more severely than you (20% vs 5% per round). Let's reach an agreement before inflation significantly reduces the value for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 425000

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering a 55-45 split, with me taking $550,000 and you taking $450,000. This is another compromise from my previous offers. Let's be practical - with each round, inflation is severely reducing the value for both of us, but especially for me (now at nearly 50% loss versus your 14%). This fair offer accounts for the asymmetric inflation while giving you a substantial portion. Let's agree now before we both lose more value."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 400000

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000}

I propose a 52-48 split, with me taking $520,000 and you taking $480,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial position. At this point, inflation has reduced the value of my share by over 67%, while yours is only down 22%. Time is clearly not in either of our favor, but it's especially harmful to me. This offer is very fair given the asymmetric inflation rates we face. Let's reach an agreement now before further rounds diminish our gains even more."
