"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it evenly, fair for both 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's proposal. She's offering an even split of the $10,000, which means we'd each get $5,000.

This is a completely fair offer. Since there's no inflation for me mentioned (0% inflation means the money maintains its value across rounds), there's no strategic advantage to rejecting this and making a counter-offer. A 50/50 split is equitable and reasonable.
