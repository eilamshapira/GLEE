"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the effective amount is $800,000. I'll make an offer to divide this amount.

{""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""alice_gain"": 550000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I were to receive $420,000, its value would be 64% of the original amount (100% - 36% = 64%). So, the effective amount I'd receive is $420,000 * 0.64 = $268,800.

Given this, I think Alice's offer is not too bad.
