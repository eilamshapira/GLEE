650000.0,350000.0,"Hi Bob, here's my offer for a swift and fair resolution: I'll receive $650000 and you'll get $350000. Since waiting only devalues my share (and possibly yours), accepting now means we both secure as much as possible. I look forward to your prompt acceptance.",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I understand your initial proposal, but considering the inflation factor, I believe a more equitable split is necessary. I propose I receive $550000 and you receive $450000. This way, we both secure a fair share while minimizing the impact of devaluation.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob’s offer gives me an effective value of $360000 (since $450000 in round 2 is worth 80% of round 1 value). If I reject and wait for round 3, further inflation would significantly reduce my payoff—even if I become the proposer, my relative impatience (20% devaluation per round for me versus 10% for Bob) means that I’d end up with much less than $360000 in present value. Given this, I choose to accept your offer.",Alice,2,accept
