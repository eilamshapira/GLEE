"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my offer for a swift and fair resolution: I'll receive $650,000 and you'll get $350,000. Since waiting only devalues my share (and possibly yours), accepting now means we both secure as much as possible. I look forward to your prompt acceptance.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your initial proposal, but considering the inflation factor, I believe a more equitable split is necessary. I propose I receive $550000 and you receive $450000. This way, we both secure a fair share while minimizing the impact of devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Bob’s offer gives me an effective value of $360,000 (since $450,000 in round 2 is worth 80% of round 1 value). If I reject and wait for round 3, further inflation would significantly reduce my payoff—even if I become the proposer, my relative impatience (20% devaluation per round for me versus 10% for Bob) means that I’d end up with much less than $360,000 in present value. Given this, I choose to accept your offer.""}"
