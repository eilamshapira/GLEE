"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my offer for a swift and fair resolution: I'll receive $650000 and you'll get $350000. Since waiting only devalues my share (and possibly yours), accepting now means we both secure as much as possible. I look forward to your prompt acceptance. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your initial proposal, but considering the inflation factor, I believe a more equitable split is necessary. I propose I receive $550,000 and you receive $450,000. This way, we both secure a fair share while minimizing the impact of devaluation.""}"
