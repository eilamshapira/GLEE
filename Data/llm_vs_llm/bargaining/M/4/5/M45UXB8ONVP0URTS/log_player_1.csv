"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

My reasoning: I'm starting with a slight advantage for myself, hoping Bob will accept to avoid the risk of further devaluation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Reasoning:

Even with the devaluation, accepting 480,000 now means I'm getting less than I offered in the first round, and I'm letting Bob get more than I proposed he should get. Since it's only the second round, I think I can get a better deal in the future. I'll risk it for now."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, it's my turn to propose again. Considering the devaluation for both of us, I'll adjust my offer, but still try to get a fair share.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 530000,
  ""bob_gain"": 470000
}
```

Reasoning: I'm lowering my initial demand slightly, hoping that the increased devaluation for Bob (10% compared to my 5%) will make this offer more attractive to him. I still want a majority, but I'm becoming more realistic about the declining value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 460000 
# Bob gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Reasoning:

Although the devaluation is becoming significant, Bob's offer is still not appealing. I'm losing more money due to devaluation, but Bob is losing even more. His offer of 460,000 for me is far too low, especially considering he's trying to take a much larger share even with his higher devaluation rate. I'll take the risk and hope for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 510000,
  ""bob_gain"": 490000
}
```

Reasoning:

I'm continuing to reduce my demand, hoping Bob will find it acceptable this time. The devaluation is hitting both of us hard now. I'm proposing a more balanced split, slightly favoring myself, to compensate for the risk I've taken so far. The key is to secure a deal before the money loses too much value."
