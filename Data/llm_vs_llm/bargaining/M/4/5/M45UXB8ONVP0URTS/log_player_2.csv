"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me after the first round, the actual amount I'm dividing is $1,000,000 * 0.9 = $900,000. 

However, to make the offer, I'll still use the original $1,000,000 as the base and adjust my share accordingly.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 470000 
# Alice gain: 530000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Alice's offer, I'll get $470,000, but its value is reduced by 19% due to inflation. So, the actual value I'll get is $470,000 * 0.81 = $380,700.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me after the first round, 10% less after the second round, and 10% less after the third round (for a total of 27.1% less, or $1,000,000 * 0.729), and 5% less after the first round, 5% less after the second round, and 5% less after the third round for Alice (for a total of 14.26% less, or $1,000,000 * 0.8574), I'll make an offer.

To make the offer, I'll still use the original $1,000,000 as the base and adjust my share accordingly.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Alice's offer, I'll get $490,000, but its value is reduced by 34.39% due to inflation. So, the actual value I'll get is $490,000 * 0.6561 = $321,509.

Given the significant reduction in value due to inflation, this offer seems more reasonable.
