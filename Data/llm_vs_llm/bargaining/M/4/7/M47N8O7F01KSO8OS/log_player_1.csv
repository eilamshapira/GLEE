"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for Round 1, keeping in mind Bob's inflation rate is much higher than mine:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

Rationale: I'm offering Bob $40, which is a significant amount. I am hoping that with a lower round, the relative money loss would be smaller for both of us."
