"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Based on the idea of an alternating‐offers game with discounting – where each delay reduces value by 10% per round for you (Alice) and 5% per round for Bob – we can compute an approximate equilibrium offer. Here’s one way to look at it:

Assume that if you (Alice) make a proposal in round 1 and Bob rejects it, then in round 2 Bob will be the proposer. In round 2 Bob’s money is “worth” 95% of round 1’s, so his continuation value is discounted by δB = 0.95. Similarly, when Bob makes an offer in round 2, if you (Alice) reject his proposal, your continuation value in round 3 will be discounted by δA = 0.9.

Let Vₐ be the “immediate” (undiscounted) payoff that Alice enjoys when she is proposer (round 1) and V_B the payoff Bob gets when he is proposer (round 2). In a subgame‐perfect equilibrium the proposer will offer the responder exactly his/her continuation value (discounted appropriately). Thus:

 • In round 1, you (Alice) propose:  
  Bob’s share must be at least δ_B · V_B, so  
  Vₐ = 10,000 – δ_B · V_B    [1]

 • In round 2, Bob will propose giving you exactly δ_A · Vₐ, so  
  V_B = 10,000 – δ_A · Vₐ    [2]

Using δ_B = 0.95 and δ_A = 0.9, substitute [2] into [1]:

  Vₐ = 10,000 – 0.95(10,000 – 0.9 Vₐ)
    = 10,000 – 9,500 + 0.855 Vₐ
    = 500 + 0.855 Vₐ

Subtract 0.855Vₐ from both sides:

  0.145 Vₐ = 500  
  Vₐ ≈ 500 / 0.145 ≈ 3,448.28

Then from [2]:

  V_B = 10,000 – 0.9 · 3,448.28  
    ≈ 10,000 – 3,103.45 ≈ 6,896.55

In round 1 your offer should therefore give you roughly $3,448.28 and Bob $10,000 – 3,448.28 = $6,551.72. Note that Bob’s “rejection value” is the prospect of proposing in round 2, which (when discounted at his rate of 5% per round) yields about 0.95 · 6,896.55 ≈ $6,551.72. In equilibrium Bob is indifferent and, by convention, we assume he accepts if offered his continuation value.

Thus, here is my round 1 offer in JSON format:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 3448.28,
  ""bob_gain"": 6551.72
}"
