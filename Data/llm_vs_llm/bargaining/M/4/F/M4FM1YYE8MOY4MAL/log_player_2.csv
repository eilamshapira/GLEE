"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 6551.72 
# Alice gain: 3448.28 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

Alice is proposing that I (Bob) get $6,551.72 and she gets $3,448.28 of the $10,000.

If I reject this offer, I'll make a counter-offer in the next round, but the total value will be worth 5% less to me and 10% less to Alice due to inflation.

This is a fairly generous offer in my favor, giving me about 65.5% of the total amount. Since the money loses value with each round and this initial offer already favors me significantly, it makes sense to accept.
