"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I'm Alice, and I need to propose a division of $10,000 to Bob, keeping in mind the 5% inflation per round for me.

Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

My reasoning is that I want a slight advantage initially, considering the inflation that will affect me in future rounds. This split should be acceptable to Bob, as he still receives a significant portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. The money is now worth 5% less to me. Bob's offer is $5500 for me and $4500 for him.

Let's calculate what $5500 is worth to me now, compared to the initial $6000 I proposed. 5% of $6000 is $300, so $6000 in round 1 is equivalent to $5700 in this round. Considering that he is offering $5500, which is not far from the equivalent of the amount that I wanted originally, I will accept it.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
