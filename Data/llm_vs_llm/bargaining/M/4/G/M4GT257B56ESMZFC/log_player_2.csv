"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Alice is offering me 4000$ out of 10,000$
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but:
   * The money will be worth 5% less to me
   * 4000$ now is better than 4200$ in the next round (due to 5% inflation)
3. While 40% is less than half, getting a deal now might be better than risking further negotiations with inflation

However, I think I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round, even accounting for inflation. The split is too unfavorable.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me make a more balanced offer, considering that:
1. The money is now worth 5% less to me
2. Alice has shown she wants a larger share
3. I need to make it attractive enough for Alice to accept, or we risk more inflation

I'll propose a 55-45 split in Alice's favor, which is more balanced than her initial offer but still gives her the larger share:

{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500}

I propose this fair split where we both get a substantial portion."
