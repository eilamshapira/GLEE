**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** The value of the money is decreasing for me. It's important to secure a deal sooner rather than later. 
* **Appearing Reasonable:**  I've already rejected one offer. Conceding a bit more makes me seem reasonable and increases the chance Bob will accept.
* **Unknown Inflation for Bob:**  I don't know how much the money is devaluing for Bob. He might be more motivated to take this deal than I realize."
