Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose a 50/50 split. It's fair and considering the inflation affects you more, it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 500000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, since the value is decreasing more for you, I'm offering a 51/49 split in my favor this time. It's a fair adjustment considering the inflation impact on your side. Let's end this soon. 
# Alice gain: 490000 
# Bob gain: 510000

Although not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in round 4 is the most logical decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me with each round. Waiting longer means getting even less.
* **Bob's Offer Improved:**  Bob initially offered a 50/50 split. Now, he's offering 51/49 in his favor. This is unlikely to improve significantly in future rounds. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a better offer is risky. Bob knows the longer the game goes, the more desperate I become, and the more he can leverage the situation.

Accepting $490,000 is better than risking getting even less in later rounds."
