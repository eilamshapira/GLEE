"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a strategic first offer, considering that Bob's money loses 20% value each round. If he rejects, his maximum potential gain will be worth less.

{""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I'm offering you $400,000. Consider that if you reject, your money will be worth 20% less next round. This is a fair first offer given the depreciation factor.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm offering you $450000. It's a fair share, and I'm taking into account the depreciation factor that affects me. Let's settle this before the money loses more value. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. 
- Bob offers me $450,000, which is worth full value to me
- Bob would get $550,000, but it's worth 20% less to him, so effectively worth $440,000 to him
- If I reject, I can make a new offer next round, but Bob's share will be worth another 20% less
- The offer gives me 45% of the total value, which isn't terrible, but I could potentially get more

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's money is now worth 40% less to him, I'll adjust my offer accordingly but make it more attractive than my first offer to encourage acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""I'm offering you $350,000. While this is less than before, due to 40% depreciation on your end, it's still worth $210,000 in your value. If you reject, the next round will reduce your value by another 20%. Let's reach an agreement now.""}"
