"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you $400000. Consider that if you reject, your money will be worth 20% less next round. This is a fair first offer given the depreciation factor. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, I should consider the depreciation factor. However, 400000 is a significant amount, and I might be able to get a better offer in the next round. But I also risk losing 20% of the potential gain.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, now it's my turn to make a proposal. Considering the depreciation factor, I'll make a reasonable offer to Alice. 

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""I'm offering you $450000. It's a fair share, and I'm taking into account the depreciation factor that affects me. Let's settle this before the money loses more value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you $350000. While this is less than before, due to 40% depreciation on your end, it's still worth $210000 in your value. If you reject, the next round will reduce your value by another 20%. Let's reach an agreement now. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that the money I gain is worth 36% less than in the first round, and Alice's offer is $350000, which is equivalent to $224000 in my value (since 36% of $350000 is $126000, and $350000 - $126000 = $224000, but she mentioned $210000, I assume she did a similar calculation), I should consider the risk of further depreciation.

If I reject this offer, the next round will reduce my value by another 20%, making the potential gain even less attractive. On the other hand, accepting this offer will give me a guaranteed amount, albeit lower than I had hoped for.
