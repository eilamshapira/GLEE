"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair initial offer, considering that inflation will affect me more severely (20% vs 5%) if we go to further rounds. I'll propose a slightly favorable split for me.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose a 55-45 split, giving me $550,000 and Bob $450,000. This is a fair offer considering the inflation risk I face is higher than Bob's."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

Due to inflation:
- If I accept now, my $450,000 is worth $360,000 (20% less)
- Bob's $550,000 is worth $522,500 (5% less)

If I reject and we go to the next round:
- I'll face another 20% reduction
- Bob will face another 5% reduction
- And I'd have to make an offer that Bob would likely accept

Given that my inflation penalty is significantly higher (20%) and the offer isn't terribly unfair, it's better to accept now than risk further devaluation.
