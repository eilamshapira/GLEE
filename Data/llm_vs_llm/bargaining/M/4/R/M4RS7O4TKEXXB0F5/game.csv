60.0,40.0,I suggest a fair split where I get a bit more since I'm making the first offer. This way we can both walk away with a good amount without risking inflation losses.,Alice,1,

70.0,30.0,"Alice, I know you had a good offer last round, but further delays only shrink my share due to inflation. I’m offering you 70 now. This generous split secures a settlement and avoids the risk of losing more value on my side. Let’s resolve this quickly and fairly.",Bob,2,
