"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I suggest a fair split where I get a bit more since I'm making the first offer. This way we can both walk away with a good amount without risking inflation losses.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know you had a good offer last round, but further delays only shrink my share due to inflation. I’m offering you 70 now. This generous split secures a settlement and avoids the risk of losing more value on my side. Let’s resolve this quickly and fairly. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Reasoning (not part of response): This is a good offer to accept because:
1. I'm getting 70% of the total amount
2. Due to 20% inflation, 70$ now is worth 56$ in original value terms (70 * 0.8)
3. This is still close to what I originally proposed (60$)
4. Waiting longer will only decrease the real value of my share due to the higher inflation rate I face
5. There's a risk of getting nothing if we go through all 12 rounds
6. Bob is being reasonable and offering a fair solution"
