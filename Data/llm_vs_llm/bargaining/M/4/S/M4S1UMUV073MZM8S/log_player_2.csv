"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is proposing I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000 out of the $10,000.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me, meaning the total value to me would only be $8,000. My counter-offer would need to get me more than $4,000 of the original amount to make rejection worthwhile.

Given the asymmetric inflation rates (20% for me vs 5% for Alice), and that I'll be able to make the next offer if I reject, I think I can get a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair offer that accounts for our different inflation rates.

Since we're now in round 2, the $10,000 is worth 20% less to me (equivalent to $8,000 in round 1 value) and 5% less to Alice (equivalent to $9,500 in round 1 value).

Given these asymmetric inflation rates, I should propose a division that recognizes Alice has less urgency to settle than I do, while still being fair enough that she'll accept rather than moving to round 3.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an even 50-50 split where we each get $5,000. This gives me $5,000 now instead of the $4,000 Alice offered, and gives Alice a fair share while avoiding further devaluation for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate this offer considering the inflation effects.

In round 1, Alice offered me $4,000. Now she's offering $4,300, but with 36% inflation for me, this $4,300 is actually worth $4,300 Ã— 0.64 = $2,752 in round 1 value.

If I reject and move to round 4, the money will be worth even less to me (around 49% less than round 1), and I'd have to make an offer compelling enough for Alice to accept.

Alice's current offer of $4,300 (worth $2,752 to me after inflation) is less valuable than her initial offer of $4,000. Given the accelerating inflation rate that affects me more severely than Alice, I should accept this offer rather than continue negotiating as my position will only weaken further.
