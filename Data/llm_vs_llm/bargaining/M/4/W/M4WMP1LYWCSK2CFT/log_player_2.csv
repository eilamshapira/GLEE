"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. It's the first round, and Alice is offering a 50-50 split. While this seems fair on the surface, I need to consider that:

1. If I reject, I can make my own offer next round
2. However, due to 5% inflation, the money will be worth less next round
3. A 50-50 split in the first round means I get $500,000 at full value
4. If I reject and we go to next round, even if I get more money, it will be worth 5% less

Getting $500,000 at full value is better than getting even $600,000 at 95% value ($570,000). Given the inflation penalty and the fairness of the offer, I should accept.
