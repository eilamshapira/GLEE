Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm offering you $45 now. If we go to the next round, I'll get 10% less value due to inflation, and we both risk getting nothing if we don't agree in time. This is a fair split considering my inflation penalty.""}"
