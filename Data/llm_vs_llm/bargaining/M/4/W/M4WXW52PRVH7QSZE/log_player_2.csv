"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you $45 now. If we go to the next round, I'll get 10% less value due to inflation, and we both risk getting nothing if we don't agree in time. This is a fair split considering my inflation penalty. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
