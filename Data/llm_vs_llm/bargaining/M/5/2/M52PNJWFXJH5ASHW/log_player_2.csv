"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair division. I'll take 60$, and you can have 40$. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm evaluating Alice's offer of $40 to me and $60 to her.

With inflation reducing the value by 20% each round, if I reject now:
- Next round, 100$ would be worth 80$ to me
- I would need to get more than 50% of the pot (>50$) in the next round to beat the current offer of $40

Let me consider if I can make a better counteroffer next round that Alice would accept. However, I don't know how inflation affects Alice, which adds uncertainty to predicting her decision.

Given that the first offer is somewhat reasonable (40% for me), and inflation will definitely impact my returns if I reject, I'll accept this offer.
