"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","To start the game, I'll make a reasonable offer. Since the money decreases in value over rounds, it's beneficial to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. Considering the inflation rates, I'll propose a division that slightly favors me to account for the higher inflation rate I'm subject to, but still keeps the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider accepting.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's settle early to maximize value.""
}
```

This offer gives me $550,000 and Bob $450,000, aiming to find a middle ground that acknowledges the different inflation rates we're both facing. The message encourages Bob to accept the offer to avoid further devaluation of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the rapid decrease in value, especially for you, I propose a more balanced split to end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the inflation rates, the total value of the money has decreased. For me, the 20% decrease means that if I were to receive the full $1,000,000, its value would now be $800,000. For Bob, the 5% decrease means the full amount would be worth $950,000 to him.

Considering Bob's offer:
- My gain: $475,000, but due to the 20% inflation, its value to me is actually $475,000 * 0.8 = $380,000.
- Bob's gain: $525,000, with a 5% decrease in value, its value to him is $525,000 * 0.95 = $498,750.

While Bob's offer seems more balanced in terms of the nominal amounts, the inflation adjustment significantly affects the real value I would receive. However, considering the rapid decrease in value, especially for me, and the fact that waiting another round would decrease the value further (to $640,000 for me and $902,500 for Bob, before considering our respective splits), it might be wise to accept this offer to avoid further loss.
