"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","For the first round, I'll make a reasonable offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob with each passing round, it's in both of our interests to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. Considering this, I'll propose a split that slightly favors me to account for the risk of waiting, but still offers Bob a significant amount to encourage acceptance.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 515000 
# Bob gain: 485000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the offer from Bob, let's calculate the actual value considering the inflation:

Original amount for me: $515,000
Inflation reduction for me: 5% of $1,000,000 = $50,000
So, the effective amount for me considering the inflation from the previous round is: $515,000 - (5% of $515,000) = $515,000 - $25,750 = $489,250

Original amount for Bob: $485,000
Inflation reduction for Bob: 10% of $1,000,000 = $100,000
So, the effective amount for Bob considering the inflation from the previous round is: $485,000 - (10% of $485,000) = $485,000 - $48,500 = $436,500

Considering the values and the fact that we are in the second round, I think Bob's offer is reasonable, and it's better to accept it now rather than risking further inflation.
