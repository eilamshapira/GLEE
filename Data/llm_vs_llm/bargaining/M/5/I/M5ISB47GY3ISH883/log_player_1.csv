"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor as I'm impacted by 20% inflation each round. This is a fair first offer that gives you a substantial portion while accounting for my inflation risk.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is more fair, considering the risk of inflation.  Let's reach a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think this through:
* In round 1, I offered myself $6000
* Now in round 2, Bob offers me $4500
* Due to 20% inflation, $4500 is actually worth $3600 to me (4500 * 0.8)
* If I reject and we go to round 3, any amount will be worth even less to me (another 20% less)
* Bob's position seems strong as inflation doesn't affect him

Even though this offer gives me less than I proposed, given the inflation pressure, I should accept. Rejecting would likely lead to an even worse outcome for me in the next round.
