"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose to take 60$ and give Bob 40$. This is a fair offer considering that my money will lose value in future rounds due to inflation, while Bob's won't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer because with 10% inflation, my $40 would only be worth $36 in real value. Since I can make another offer in the next round, I'll try to negotiate a better split that accounts for the inflation effect."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}

I propose to take 65$ and give Bob 35$. With 20% total inflation affecting my share at this point, my $65 would be worth about $52 in real value. This accounts for the inflation impact while still giving Bob a substantial portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer because with 27.1% inflation, my $35 would only be worth about $25.52 in real value, which is far too low. We still have several rounds to negotiate a fairer split that accounts for the increasing inflation impact on my share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I propose to take 70$ and give Bob 30$. With 34.4% total inflation affecting my share at this point, my $70 would be worth about $45.92 in real value. This split is more fair considering the significant inflation impact on my share, while still giving Bob a reasonable portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer because with 40.95% inflation, my $30 would only be worth about $17.72 in real value, which is extremely unfair. Even though each rejection leads to more inflation, this offer is too low. I'll make another counter-offer that better accounts for the inflation impact."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}

I propose to take 75$ and give Bob 25$. With 46.86% total inflation affecting my share at this point, my $75 would be worth about $39.86 in real value. This split may look uneven at first glance, but accounting for inflation, it results in a more balanced real-value distribution. I hope Bob understands that the higher nominal amount for me is necessary to compensate for the severe inflation impact."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer because with 52.17% inflation, my $25 would only be worth about $11.96 in real value, which is extremely unfair. Even though we're getting into late rounds and the inflation penalty is severe, this offer gives Bob more than 6 times my real value. I'll try one more time to negotiate a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}

I propose to take 80$ and give Bob 20$. With 56.95% total inflation affecting my share at this point, my $80 would be worth about $34.44 in real value. While this might seem like a very uneven split, after accounting for inflation, I'm actually only getting about 1.7 times what Bob would get. We're running out of rounds, so I hope Bob will understand that this split is necessary to account for the severe inflation impact on my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While it's not ideal (my $20 is only worth $7.75 in real value due to 61.26% inflation), we're getting dangerously close to the end. If we continue rejecting offers, there's a risk we'll reach round 12 with no agreement and both get nothing. At least this way I get something, even if it's a small amount. The inflation penalty has made continued negotiation too risky."
