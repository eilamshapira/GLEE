"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer that's fair and considers the differing inflation penalties we face.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm proposing I receive $5,500 and you receive $4,500. This is slightly in my favor because our inflation rates are different - mine is 10% per round while yours is 20%. If we delay agreement, both our shares lose value, but yours loses more quickly. This initial division acknowledges that difference while still giving you a substantial portion."
