5500.0,4500.0,Hi Bob! I propose we divide it so that I take $5500 and you take $4500. Let's close this now and not risk the value declining in future rounds!,Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, considering the depreciation effect, this is actually a fair offer. You'll get $4500 now which is worth $4050 to you, while waiting another round would make the whole pot worth less for both of us. Let's make a deal now.",Bob,2,
