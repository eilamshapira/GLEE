"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Hi Bob! I propose we divide it so that I take $5500 and you take $4500. Let's close this now and not risk the value declining in future rounds!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the depreciation effect, this is actually a fair offer. You'll get $4500 now which is worth $4050 to you, while waiting another round would make the whole pot worth less for both of us. Let's make a deal now. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
