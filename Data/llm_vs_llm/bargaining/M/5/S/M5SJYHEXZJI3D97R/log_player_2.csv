"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I propose we divide it so that I take $5500 and you take $4500. Let's close this now and not risk the value declining in future rounds! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With this offer:
- I would get $4500
- Alice would get $5500

If I reject and we go to next round:
- The money will be worth 20% less for me
- Money will be worth 10% less for Alice 
- But I get to make the next offer

The total value in next round would be:
For me: $10000 * 0.8 = $8000
For Alice: $10000 * 0.9 = $9000

Since I can make a better offer next round even with the depreciation, and Alice would be more likely to accept due to her own value loss...

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a strategic offer...

Since money is now worth 20% less to me and 10% less to Alice:
- For me: $10000 * 0.8 = $8000 total value
- For Alice: $10000 * 0.9 = $9000 total value

If Alice rejects, in the next round:
- For me: $10000 * 0.64 = $6400 total value
- For Alice: $10000 * 0.81 = $8100 total value

I should offer something that's better for Alice than waiting another round.
