55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob! I'm suggesting a slightly favorable split for me at 55/45. Since you face higher inflation (20% vs my 10%), it's better for you to accept now rather than counter-offer. If we go to round 2, your $45 is worth more than my $55 would be after a round of inflation.",Alice,1,

40.0,60.0,"Alice, given that my money loses value faster than yours, I propose a split of 60/40. This is a more favorable offer for you than the first round considering the inflation, but it is a reasonable negotiation point.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
65.0,35.0,"Bob, I understand your concern about inflation, but your previous offer wasn't favorable to me. Looking at the current situation: your $35 now is worth more than $60 would be after another round of inflation (which would be worth only $38.40 to you after 36% total inflation). Let's finish this now - this is a fair offer considering our different inflation rates and the game dynamics.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
50.0,50.0,"Alice, let's split it evenly at 50/50. This is a fair division, considering my money has lost more value due to inflation, and the offer aligns with the game dynamics. This is the most beneficial outcome for both of us given the current situation.",Bob,4,
