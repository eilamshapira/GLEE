"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I'm ready to play.

Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. The money is worth 10% less now.

Considering the inflation, the 5000$ I would get now is only worth the equivalent of 4500$ of the first round. Also, if I reject this, the next offer will be worse.

Therefore, I will accept the offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
