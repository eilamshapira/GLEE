"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer gives me only 10% of the total money, which is quite low. Given that each round decreases the value by 10% for me due to inflation, I should consider making a counter-offer that's more favorable.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more balanced division that takes into account the inflation effect on my end.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I suggest we split the money equally. This is a fair division that gives us both the same amount. Since I'm facing 10% inflation each round, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly."
