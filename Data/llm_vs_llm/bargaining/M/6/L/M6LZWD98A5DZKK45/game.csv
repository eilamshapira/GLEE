4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, I understand the urgency but given the inflation is worse on my side, I propose a 55-45 split to compensate for it. Let's aim to reach an agreement quickly!",Bob,2,

5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, I appreciate your point about inflation, but I've just learned that you face 20% inflation per round compared to my 5%. Since we're already in round 3, a fair division should consider our different inflation rates. This split is more equitable when accounting for our different time pressures. Let's resolve this now before both of us lose more value.",Alice,3,

4800.0,5200.0,"Alice, let's aim for a slightly more favorable offer for me given the inflation I'm experiencing. I believe a 52-48 split is fair considering the circumstances. I hope we can settle this in this round.",Bob,4,
