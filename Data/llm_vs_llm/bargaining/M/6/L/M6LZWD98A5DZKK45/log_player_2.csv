"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm suggesting a fair 50-50 split. I face 5% inflation each round, so it's in my interest to resolve this quickly, but I still want to start with an equal division that respects both our interests. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand the urgency but given the inflation is worse on my side, I propose a 55-45 split to compensate for it. Let's aim to reach an agreement quickly!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your point about inflation, but I've just learned that you face 20% inflation per round compared to my 5%. Since we're already in round 3, a fair division should consider our different inflation rates. This split is more equitable when accounting for our different time pressures. Let's resolve this now before both of us lose more value. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Alice, let's aim for a slightly more favorable offer for me given the inflation I'm experiencing. I believe a 52-48 split is fair considering the circumstances. I hope we can settle this in this round.""}"
