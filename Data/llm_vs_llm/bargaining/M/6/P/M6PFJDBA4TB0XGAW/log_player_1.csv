"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair initial offer, considering that money will be worth 5% less for me in the next round if Bob rejects my proposal.

{""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I suggest an equal split of the money. This is a fair division that gives us both the same amount, and we can both walk away satisfied with the outcome."
