"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 900,000$ to 100,000$ split in my favor.  This seems fair as I am initiating the negotiation, and we can work towards a more even split in later rounds if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
