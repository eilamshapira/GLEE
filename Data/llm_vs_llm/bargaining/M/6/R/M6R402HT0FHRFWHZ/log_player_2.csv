"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4872 
# Alice gain: 5128 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer...

It's a fairly even split, with Alice taking slightly more (51.28%) and offering me 48.72%. While not perfectly equal, it's a reasonable first offer. 

However, if I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round. But I need to consider that:
1. The total amount will decrease by 5% (to 9,500$) next round
2. I would need to offer Alice enough to make her accept
3. Alice might reject my offer, leading to further depreciation

Given that rejecting would mean losing $500 in total value, and the current split is quite fair, accepting seems like the rational choice.
