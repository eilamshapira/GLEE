"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose an equal split of $100: $50 for each of us. Settling now avoids any inflation losses on my side, so I believe it's in both our interests to agree quickly. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which gives me $50. If I reject and move to the next round, I would face 20% inflation, meaning my money would be worth less. Even if I managed to get more in absolute terms in the next round, the 20% inflation penalty needs to be factored in.

A $50 share now is better than risking a potentially worse outcome after inflation. This seems like a fair initial offer.
