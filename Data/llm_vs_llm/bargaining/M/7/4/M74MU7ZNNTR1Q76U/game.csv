60.0,40.0,"Hey Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Keep in mind that if we go to the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation, which means we should try to reach an agreement quickly. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances.",Alice,1,

52.0,48.0,"Alice, I understand the need to move quickly to avoid further devaluation. With the current round reducing my share by 5%, I propose a 48-52 split in our favorâ€”giving you a slight edge to account for any considerations on your end while still limiting my losses. Let's agree now before inflation impacts any further rounds.",Bob,2,
