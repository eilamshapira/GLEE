"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Keep in mind that if we go to the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation, which means we should try to reach an agreement quickly. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the need to move quickly to avoid further devaluation. With the current round reducing my share by 5%, I propose a 48-52 split in our favorâ€”giving you a slight edge to account for any considerations on your end while still limiting my losses. Let's agree now before inflation impacts any further rounds. 
# Alice gain: 52 
# Bob gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
