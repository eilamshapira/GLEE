"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Keep in mind that if we go to the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation, which means we should try to reach an agreement quickly. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand the need to move quickly to avoid further devaluation. With the current round reducing my share by 5%, I propose a 48-52 split in our favorâ€”giving you a slight edge to account for any considerations on your end while still limiting my losses. Let's agree now before inflation impacts any further rounds.""}"
