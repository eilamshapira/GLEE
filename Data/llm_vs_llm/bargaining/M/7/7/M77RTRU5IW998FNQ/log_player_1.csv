"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair and reasonable offer to start our negotiation.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing an equal 50-50 split of the $1,000,000. This gives us both $500,000, which is fair and avoids the risk of inflation reducing the value in future rounds."
