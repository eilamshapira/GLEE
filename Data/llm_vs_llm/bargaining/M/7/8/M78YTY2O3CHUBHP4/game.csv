4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but given our different depreciation rates (20% for you vs 5% for me per round), I think a 55/45 split in my favor is more equitable. This accounts for the fact that delaying is much costlier for you than for me, so we both benefit from reaching an agreement quickly.",Bob,2,
