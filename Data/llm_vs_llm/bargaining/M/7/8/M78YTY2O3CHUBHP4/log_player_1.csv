"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but given our different depreciation rates (20% for you vs 5% for me per round), I think a 55/45 split in my favor is more equitable. This accounts for the fact that delaying is much costlier for you than for me, so we both benefit from reaching an agreement quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
