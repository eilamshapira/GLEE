"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. 60/40 seems reasonable for the first round. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider the fact that with each passing round, the money will be worth 5% less for me, while for Alice, it's 20% less. Let's analyze this offer:

Alice offers me 4000$, which is 40% of the total.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value would be:
- For me: 10,000$ × 0.95 = 9,500$
- For Alice: 10,000$ × 0.8 = 8,000$

Given the significant depreciation for Alice (20% vs my 5%), I have some negotiating leverage in future rounds. However, 4000$ is still a substantial amount, and there's always risk in prolonging negotiations.

I think I can probably negotiate for a better deal, given the asymmetric inflation rates.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make an offer that acknowledges the asymmetric depreciation rates while still being reasonable for both of us.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but given our different depreciation rates (20% for you vs 5% for me per round), I think a 55/45 split in my favor is more equitable. This accounts for the fact that delaying is much costlier for you than for me, so we both benefit from reaching an agreement quickly.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point about the depreciation rates. How about we meet in the middle with a 55/45 split in my favor? It's important we strike a deal soon. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer given the ongoing depreciation.

At this point:
- For me, the money has depreciated by 9.75% (value factor of 0.9025)
- For Alice, the money has depreciated by 36% (value factor of 0.64)

Alice is now offering me 4500$, which is 45% of the total.

If I reject and we move to round 4:
- My depreciation would increase to approximately 14.75%
- Alice's depreciation would increase to 56%

Given the accelerating value loss for Alice, she has stronger incentives to reach an agreement quickly. However, her current offer is reasonable and does give me a better deal than her initial proposal.

While I could potentially push for more in the next round, the risk of continued depreciation and potentially losing the deal altogether makes accepting this offer a prudent choice.
