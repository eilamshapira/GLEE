"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair offer to start.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose we split the money equally, $500,000 each. This is a fair division that maximizes our combined outcome, and I'd be happy to accept the same offer if Bob proposed it."
