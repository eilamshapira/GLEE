"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. Given that we both face inflation risks with each round, accepting this fair offer now would be beneficial for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation risk, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This way, we both get a significant amount, and it's better to settle now rather than losing more value in the next rounds. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $450,000, but it's worth 5% less due to inflation, so effectively $427,500
- If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount I get will be worth another 5% less
- The difference between my initial offer (where I would get $600,000) and Bob's current offer ($450,000) is significant
- However, the inflation impact makes waiting more costly

Since a 5% reduction in value per round is significant, and Bob's offer still gives me a substantial amount, it would be rational to accept rather than risk further devaluation.
