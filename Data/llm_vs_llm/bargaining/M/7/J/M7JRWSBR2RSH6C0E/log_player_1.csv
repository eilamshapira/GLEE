"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me make a reasonable first offer. Since I want to secure a good portion while still being fair enough for Bob to accept, I'll propose a slightly favorable split for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split, which gives me $600,000 and Bob $400,000. This is a fair offer that leaves Bob with a substantial amount while acknowledging that I'm making the first move and need to account for potential future inflation if the game continues."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:
1. Due to 5% inflation, if I accept now, my $400,000 is actually worth $380,000 to me
2. If I reject and we continue to round 3, any amount I get will be worth 10% less
3. Bob is offering me a 40-60 split, which is the inverse of what I offered
4. We still have many rounds left, but inflation will keep eating into my share
5. Getting $380,000 in real value now might be better than risking further depreciation

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While it's not ideal, the inflation penalty makes it risky to continue negotiating, and $380,000 in real value is still a substantial amount."
