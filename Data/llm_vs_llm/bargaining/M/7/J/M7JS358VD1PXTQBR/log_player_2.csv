"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly! I'll take 60 and you get 40. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100. If I reject, we'll move to the next round where I can make a counter-offer, but the money will be worth 10% less to me. That means in the next round, the maximum I could get would be worth only $90 to me.

Since this is the first round and Alice's offer gives me a decent portion, though not equal, rejecting might lead to a back-and-forth negotiation where we both lose value due to inflation. The $40 I'm offered now is worth more than a potentially higher amount in future rounds due to the inflation effect.
