"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

* Current value for me (Bob): $40
* If I reject and propose next round:
  * Money is worth 10% less for me
  * Maximum I could get would be $90 (worth $81 after 10% reduction)
  * But Alice would likely reject a very uneven split
  * A fair offer in round 2 might still get me more than $40

Since Alice is losing value faster (20% per round), I have some leverage to negotiate for a better deal. I believe I can get a more favorable split by making a counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since money loses value faster for Alice (20% per round) than for me (10% per round), I'll propose a more balanced split, but slightly in my favor. This should be attractive to Alice since waiting another round would cost her more than me.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'm offering a 55-45 split in my favor. This is more balanced than her initial offer, and considering the higher depreciation rate for Alice, she should be motivated to accept rather than wait for another round where her money would be worth 20% less."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

* Current offer value for me: $45 Ã— (1 - 0.19) = $36.45
* If I reject and propose next round:
  * Money will be worth 29% less for me (additional 10%)
  * Money will be worth 56% less for Alice (additional 20%)
  * Any future gains will be significantly devalued for both of us
  * The negotiation power advantage from Alice's higher depreciation rate is being offset by the overall loss of value

Given that:
1. The total value is rapidly decreasing for both of us
2. This is a more balanced offer than the first round
3. Further negotiations will significantly reduce the real value for both parties
4. $36.45 is better than risking another round of depreciation
