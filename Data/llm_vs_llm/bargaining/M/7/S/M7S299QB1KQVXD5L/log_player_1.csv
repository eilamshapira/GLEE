"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to consider the impact of inflation on my strategy. With a 20% decrease in value each round, it's better to reach an agreement sooner. I should make a fair but strategic first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose a 55/45 split in our favor. This gives me a slight advantage while still offering Bob a substantial portion of the money. Given the inflation penalty I face in future rounds, it's important we reach an agreement quickly, which is why I'm making this reasonable offer instead of being too aggressive."
