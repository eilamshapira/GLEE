"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this... 

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 5% less to me. With the current offer I get $450,000.

If I wait one round, even if I manage to get a better split, I'll lose 5% of whatever amount I get. To beat $450,000, I would need to secure more than $473,684 in the next round ($473,684 * 0.95 = $450,000).

While Alice's offer gives her a larger share, it's still a substantial amount for me and avoiding inflation risk seems wise. The difference between our shares ($100,000) is less than what I could lose to inflation if negotiations extend further.
