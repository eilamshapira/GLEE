"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. This is an even 50-50 split of the money, which seems fair on the surface. However, I need to account for the 5% inflation penalty if I reject and move to the next round.

If I reject, the total value will effectively be 950,000 for me in the next round. Even if I were to propose taking all of it then, I'd still only get 950,000 which is less than what I could get by accepting the current 500,000.

Given the inflation effect, a bird in hand is worth more than two in the bush. The 50-50 split is reasonable, and trying to negotiate for more would likely result in a worse outcome for me due to inflation.
