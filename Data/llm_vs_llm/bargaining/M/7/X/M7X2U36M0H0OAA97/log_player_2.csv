"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice proposes a 50-50 split, which is perfectly fair
2. I know inflation won't affect my share (0%)
3. If I reject, I might get a chance to propose a better deal, but Alice might reject
4. With 12 rounds available, accepting now guarantees a good outcome rather than risking getting nothing
5. $500,000 is a substantial amount

I'll accept this fair offer.
