"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $40 while she takes $60.

Let me think this through. If I reject, we move to the next round where I can make an offer, but the total amount will decrease by 10% to $90. That means even if I proposed a 50/50 split in the next round, I'd get $45. However, Alice might reject that, leading to further rounds and more depreciation.

Given that this is the first round with the full $100 value, and my alternative is potentially less than $40 if negotiations drag on, I think it's reasonable to accept this offer.
