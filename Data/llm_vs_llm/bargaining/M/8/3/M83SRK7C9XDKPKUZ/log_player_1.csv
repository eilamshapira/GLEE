"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I need to propose a division of $1,000,000 to Bob. Since the money is worth 20% less to me each round but only 10% less to Bob each round, I have more incentive to reach an agreement quickly.

Let me calculate a fair proposal that accounts for this asymmetric inflation:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a substantial share of $450,000 (45%). This is a fair offer considering our different inflation rates. If we move to the next round, the total value decreases for both of us, so it's in our mutual interest to agree now.""}"
