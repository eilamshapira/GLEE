"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, to avoid further losses from inflation on my end and to reach an efficient resolution, I propose this division in round 2. Based on a fair bargaining equilibrium—with each of us discounting future cash by 10% per round—this split reflects our respective future bargaining positions. I hope you agree that locking in a deal now is in both our interests. 
# Alice gain: 473685 
# Bob gain: 526315 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
