Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'd like to propose an equal 50/50 split. By agreeing now, we avoid further round-induced inflation on my side, and I believe this fair division honors the spirit of your earlier message. Let's settle this quickly and fairly. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
