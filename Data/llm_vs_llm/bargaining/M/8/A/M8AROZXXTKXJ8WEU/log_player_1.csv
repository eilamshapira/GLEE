"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair and reasonable split of the money. Since both players need to agree, and we want to avoid prolonged negotiations that might lead to inflation, I'll offer a slight advantage to Bob to encourage acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}

This is a reasonable split where Bob gets a bit more than half, which should make it attractive for him to accept, while still securing a substantial amount for myself. I'll explain to Bob: ""I propose you get $550,000 and I get $450,000 - a favorable split for you that allows us both to walk away with a significant sum."""
