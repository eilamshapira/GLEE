"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 510000,
""bob_gain"": 490000
}
```

My reasoning: I'm aiming for a slight advantage to myself, but offering Bob a substantial amount to incentivize acceptance and avoid the risk of inflation eroding the value in later rounds. A near 50/50 split is generally a good starting point in these types of negotiation games."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I see Bob's offer. Let's analyze.

*   **Original Value:** $1,000,000
*   **Current Value (after 20% inflation):** $1,000,000 * 0.8 = $800,000

Bob is offering me $450,000. This represents $450,000 / $800,000 = 56.25% of the current value.

In Round 1, I offered him 49%. Now he's demanding a higher portion for himself. While it's tempting to reject and counter, the risk of further inflation is significant. If we reach Round 3, the total pot will be worth only $640,000.

I will accept this offer, even though it's not ideal. The risk of the game going on and the money shrinking is too high.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
