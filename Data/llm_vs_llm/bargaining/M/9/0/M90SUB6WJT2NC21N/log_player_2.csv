"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. 60/40 split seems reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice proposes I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 10% less to me
3. $4,000 now is better than $4,444 next round (which would be needed to offset the 10% inflation)
4. While 40/60 isn't perfectly equal, it's not terribly unfair

However, I think I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round, even considering the inflation penalty. A more equal split would be preferable.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split, considering that Alice showed willingness to negotiate but started with an advantage for herself.

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""I appreciate your opening offer, Alice, but I believe a 50/50 split is more fair. We both benefit equally this way.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement. 55/45 acknowledges your input while still reflecting the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
1. Alice has improved her offer from 60/40 to 55/45
2. I would get $4,500, but with 19% inflation, it's effectively worth $3,645 to me
3. If I reject, the next round will have even more inflation (29% for me)
4. Alice is also experiencing significant inflation (36%)
5. We're already in round 3 of 12, and the offer is more reasonable

Given that:
- The offer is more balanced than the first one
- The inflation is significantly eating into both our gains
- There's a risk of getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds
- Alice has shown willingness to compromise
