Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my money is already worth less due to inflation. 57/43 is my final offer for a relatively quick deal. It's better than losing more to inflation if we keep going. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is clearly trying to leverage the inflation against me, but her offer is only slightly better than her first one. I need to hold out for a better deal."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, inflation is killing us both! Meet me in the middle-ish at 55/45. This is a better deal for both of us than gambling further. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is getting too risky.  Alice is clearly feeling the pressure too. It's not my ideal split, but it's better to take a decent amount now than risk getting nothing."
