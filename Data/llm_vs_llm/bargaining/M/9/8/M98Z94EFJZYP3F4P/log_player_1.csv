"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'll explain this to Bob: ""I propose a fairly even split where I get $5,500 and you get $4,500. This is close to 50-50, and accepting now means we both get the maximum value before inflation kicks in."""
