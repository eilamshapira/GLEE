"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. 
Alice is proposing I get $4500 while she gets $5500. While it's not an even split, it's relatively fair. 

If I reject, we move to round 2 where I can make a counter-offer, but the total amount will be worth 20% less (only $8000 total). Even if I proposed a more favorable split for myself then, I likely wouldn't end up with more than $4500.

Therefore, I'll accept this reasonable first offer rather than risk losing value through inflation.
