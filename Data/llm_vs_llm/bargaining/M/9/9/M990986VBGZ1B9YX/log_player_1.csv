"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll analyze this game strategically. 

With declining values (20% per round for me, 5% for Bob), the total value decreases more for me than for Bob. In the final round, if we don't agree, we both get nothing, which gives Bob leverage in later rounds.

Let me make a fair opening offer with a simple explanation:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a slightly higher split for me since the money loses value faster for me (20% vs 5% per round). This is fair given our different discount rates, and we can avoid the value decreasing for both of us by agreeing now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the different discount rates, I believe this split is more appropriate. Let's come to an agreement soon to minimize the value loss for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I need to be strategic about this offer, considering the increasing disadvantage I face with each round passing.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Bob, let's meet in the middle with a 50-50 split. This is the fairest division, and we're both losing value with each round - me at 20% and you at 5%. A fair split now benefits both of us more than continued negotiations.""}"
