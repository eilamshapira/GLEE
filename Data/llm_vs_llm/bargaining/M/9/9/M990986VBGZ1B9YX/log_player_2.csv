"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a slightly higher split for me since the money loses value faster for me (20% vs 5% per round). This is fair given our different discount rates, and we can avoid the value decreasing for both of us by agreeing now. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

# Message to Alice:
# Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but given the different discount rates, I think a more balanced split would be fairer. Let's consider a 550,000$ split for me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's meet in the middle with a 50-50 split. This is the fairest division, and we're both losing value with each round - me at 20% and you at 5%. A fair split now benefits both of us more than continued negotiations. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
