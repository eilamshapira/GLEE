This is a tough decision! Here's why I chose this strategy:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing for me each round.  Waiting longer means I lose more potential value even if I get a slightly better split.
* **Fairness:**  A 50/50 split is inherently fair. While I shot for a higher amount in Round 1, Bob's rejection and subsequent low offer suggest he might not be very reasonable. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a chance Bob will reject this offer hoping for a better deal in Round 4. However, the decreasing value of the money makes it increasingly risky for me to wait. 

Let's see what Bob does!"
