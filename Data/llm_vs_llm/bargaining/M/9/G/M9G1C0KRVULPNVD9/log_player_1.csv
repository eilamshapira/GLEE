"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to propose a split of $10,000, keeping in mind the decreasing value of the money for both me and Bob with each round.

Here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this.

*   **Bob's offer:** $5000 for me, $5000 for him.
*   **My inflation:** My money is now worth 10% less.
*   **Bob's inflation:** Bob's money is now worth 5% less.

Since I rejected the first offer, I have to consider my options: accept this offer or risk another round of inflation where my money is worth less.

Since Bob's original offer was only negligibly different from an even split, I will take it.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
