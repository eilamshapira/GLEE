"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to make a strategic offer that takes into account the different inflation rates for me and Bob. Since my inflation rate is lower (10% vs Bob's 20%), I have a slight advantage in later rounds, but we both lose value by delaying.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This gives Bob a significant portion while acknowledging that I have a slight advantage in the negotiation due to our different inflation rates. If we move to the next round, we'll both get less value overall, so this is a fair offer that benefits us both by concluding the deal now."
