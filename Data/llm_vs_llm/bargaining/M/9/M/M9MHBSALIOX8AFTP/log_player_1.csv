"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 6000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice! Since we both face inflation, let's split the amount equally at $5000 each. This way, we both benefit fairly before inflation reduces our gains further. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

For me, $5000 after 20% inflation is worth $4000 in real value.
For Bob, $5000 after 5% inflation is worth $4750 in real value.

While this is less favorable than my initial offer, if I reject and we go to another round, the inflation will hurt my position even more (I'll lose another 20% in the next round). The equal split might not be perfect, but it's better than risking further devaluation.
