Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I understand we both want to minimize inflation losses. Let's settle for a 55-45 split in my favor this time, as the value of the money is decreasing for me.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle with a 52-48 split. We've both lost value to inflation already, and continuing to negotiate will only hurt us both. This is a fair compromise.
