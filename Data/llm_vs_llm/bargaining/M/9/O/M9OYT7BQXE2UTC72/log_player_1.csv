Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. My money is losing value fast. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Although not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most rational decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** The money is losing value rapidly for both of us. While my potential earnings are decreasing faster, delaying further only increases the risk of getting even less in future rounds.
* **Bob's Stance:** His message indicates he's unlikely to budge from this offer. Rejecting it risks him offering even less in a future round, where the money will be worth even less. 
* **Certainty vs. Risk:** Accepting now guarantees a less than ideal but still substantial amount. Rejecting risks a worse outcome, potentially leaving us both with a significantly smaller pot to split. 

While I'm not happy with Bob's aggressive approach, cutting my losses now is the most logical choice in the face of the rapid devaluation."
