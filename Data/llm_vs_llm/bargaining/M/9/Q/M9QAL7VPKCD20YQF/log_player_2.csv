Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the money 60-40 in my favor. Given the inflation rates, this seems fair to start. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Alice after each round, I'll take that into account for my offer.

The value of the money for me after 1 round is: $1,000,000 * 0.9 = $900,000
The value of the money for Alice after 1 round is: $1,000,000 * 0.8 = $800,000

Considering the decreasing value, I'll make a more even split to encourage Alice to accept.
