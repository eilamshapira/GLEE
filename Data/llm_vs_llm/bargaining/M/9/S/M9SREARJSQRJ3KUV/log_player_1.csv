"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, since you face 10% inflation per round compared to my 5%, waiting is more costly for you. This 55/45 split is fair and benefits us both more than continuing to future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and Bob's offer, I will respond:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I think I can get a better deal in the next round, and Bob's offer doesn't seem favorable enough to me, especially since the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob in each round, I'll take that into account for my next offer.

For me, the $10,000 is now worth $10,000 * 0.9 * 0.9 = $8,100 (20% less than the original value)
For Bob, the $10,000 is now worth $10,000 * 0.95 * 0.95 = $9,025 (9.75% less than the original value, but I'll use 10% for simplicity, so $9,000)

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 5200, 
""bob_gain"": 4800, 
""message"": ""Considering inflation, this 52/48 split is more reasonable, don't you think?""}"
