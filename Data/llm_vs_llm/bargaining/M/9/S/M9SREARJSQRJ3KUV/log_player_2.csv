"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40, a fair start 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. 

Alice is proposing a 60/40 split in her favor, meaning I would get $4,000 and she would get $6,000.

If I reject this offer, I'll get to make a counter-proposal in the next round. However, I need to consider that with each passing round, inflation reduces the value of the money - 5% less for me and 10% less for Alice.

Given that Alice faces higher inflation (10% vs my 5%), I have some negotiating leverage in later rounds. If I reject now, I can propose a more favorable split next round, and Alice would have more incentive to accept due to her higher inflation rate.

I think I can get a better deal by making my own proposal.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll create a fair offer that takes our different inflation rates into account.

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, since you face 10% inflation per round compared to my 5%, waiting is more costly for you. This 55/45 split is fair and benefits us both more than continuing to future rounds.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this 52/48 split is more reasonable, don't you think? 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this new offer.

Alice is now proposing a 52/48 split in her favor, which means I would get $4,800 and she would get $5,200.

Due to inflation, my $4,800 would be worth about 9.75% less than in the first round, so the effective value for me is approximately $4,332.

If I reject and we move to round 4, inflation will reduce the value by another 5% for me and 10% for Alice. This means Alice's inflation disadvantage is growing, which gives me more leverage.

However, I also need to consider that the split she's offering is more reasonable than her initial 60/40 proposal. A 52/48 split is much closer to equal.

Given that she's moved significantly toward a more equitable division, and considering that continuing the negotiation reduces the total value for both of us, I think this is a reasonable compromise.
