Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

This is a fair 50-50 split, which is generally considered equitable. However, since I'm the first to respond, I could try to negotiate for a better deal. If I reject, I'll get to make the next offer.

The risk is that with 5% inflation per round, if we keep negotiating, we both lose value. The $50 I would get now is worth more than $50 in the next round.

* Current offer: $50
* After inflation (next round): $47.50

Since this is a fair offer and any delay will reduce the total value, I should accept.
