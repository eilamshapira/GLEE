Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, time is money—quite literally! Since every delay reduces your dollars by 20% (and mine by 10%), waiting hurts more on your side. If you reject this offer, you'll be proposer in round 3, but even then you’d only transform nearly all of the $10000 at a 0.64 multiplier—that’s about $6400 in effective value. Right now, by accepting, you secure an effective $8000 (8000 × 0.8) while I get $2000 nominal (which is $1800 effective for me). I believe this division is the fastest way for both of us to salvage as much as possible from the pie. I hope you see the benefit of settling now. What do you say?

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the inflation effects this round (my dollars at 72.9% and yours at 51.2% of round‐1 value), rejecting now means that if you become proposer in round 5 you can at best secure an effective payoff of about $4096. To prevent further loss from delay—and since I know you wouldn’t settle for less than your next round’s guaranteed value—I’m offering you $8000 nominal (which amounts to $8000 × 0.512 ≈ $4096 effective) while I take $2000 nominal (≈ $2000 × 0.729 ≈ $1458 effective). I believe this offer matches your reservation value. Let’s settle now rather than diminish our payoffs further.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, here's my proposal in round 6. At this stage, every dollar for me is now worth about 59.05% of its initial value and for you 32.77%, so waiting further only erodes the value we can both secure. If you reject, you'll be proposer in round 7, but your dollars will then be worth only 26.21% (0.8⁶) of their initial value, and you'll be forced to leave me just enough to meet my reservation value in round 8. By accepting this split—$7000 for you and $3000 for me—you lock in an effective payoff of roughly $2294 for you and $1771 for me, which is better than the uncertain and further depreciated outcome if we drag this on. Let's benefit from our cooperation now rather than watching our total pie erode further. What do you say?

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, as we step into round 8, the inflation penalty has become severe – every dollar for me is now worth about 47.8% of its initial value and for you only about 21.0%. If you reject this offer, you'll become proposer in round 9, but the anticipated calculations show that even then you’d secure an effective payoff of roughly 2857 × 0.1678 ≈ $480–$600 at best. In the equilibrium of our alternating-offer game, my proposal today gives you the continuation value you’d otherwise have to fight for later. Specifically, by accepting this division, you receive $2857 nominally, which translates to approximately 2857 × 0.2097 ≈ $600 in today’s terms, while I secure about 7143 × 0.4783 ≈ $3415 effectively. In light of our worsening situation due to inflation, I believe this split is the most reasonable way to lock in our maximum possible payoffs. Let’s settle now rather than watch our pie erode further.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, here’s the situation in round 10. If you reject, you'll be the proposer in round 11, but because of the heavy discounting, you’d only be able to secure an effective payoff of roughly $106—even by taking nearly the entire $10000 nominal amount available in round 11 (since your current discount factor is about 0.1342, you’d end up with around $1073.74 nominal value that translates to ≈ $107 in effective terms). To avoid that steep drop, I'm offering you $790 nominal now, which, at the current effective rate of 13.42% for you, gives you about $106 in real value. I’m taking $9210 nominal, which, with my effective factor of approximately 0.3874, nets me around $3571 effective. This division reflects the equilibrium continuation values: you get exactly what rejecting would guarantee you, and I capture the proposer’s advantage. I believe this is the most rational outcome given our ticking clock—please accept.

# Bob gain: 9210
