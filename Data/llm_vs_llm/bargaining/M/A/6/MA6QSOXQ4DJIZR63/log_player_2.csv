Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 2000, ""alice_gain"": 8000, ""message"": ""Alice, time is money—quite literally! Since every delay reduces your dollars by 20% (and mine by 10%), waiting hurts more on your side. If you reject this offer, you'll be proposer in round 3, but even then you’d only transform nearly all of the $10,000 at a 0.64 multiplier—that’s about $6,400 in effective value. Right now, by accepting, you secure an effective $8,000 (8000 × 0.8) while I get $2,000 nominal (which is $1,800 effective for me). I believe this division is the fastest way for both of us to salvage as much as possible from the pie. I hope you see the benefit of settling now. What do you say?""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the time pressure, but your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. This is a more balanced proposal that still allows us both to benefit significantly from the remaining amount. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000

Round 4

To prevent further loss from delay—and since I know you wouldn’t settle for less than your next round’s guaranteed value—I’m offering you $8,000 nominal (which amounts to $8,000 × 0.512 ≈ $4,096 effective) while I take $2,000 nominal (≈ $2,000 × 0.729 ≈ $1,458 effective). I believe this offer matches your reservation value. Let’s settle now rather than diminish our payoffs further.""}"

Alice's offer:

At this stage, every dollar for me is now worth about 59.05% of its initial value and for you 32.77%, so waiting further only erodes the value we can both secure. If you reject, you'll be proposer in round 7, but your dollars will then be worth only 26.21% (0.8⁶) of their initial value, and you'll be forced to leave me just enough to meet my reservation value in round 8. By accepting this split—$7000 for you and $3000 for me—you lock in an effective payoff of roughly $2294 for you and $1771 for me, which is better than the uncertain and further depreciated outcome if we drag this on. Let's benefit from our cooperation now rather than watching our total pie erode further. What do you say?""}"

Alice's offer:

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 7143, ""alice_gain"": 2857, ""message"": ""Alice, as we step into round 8, the inflation penalty has become severe – every dollar for me is now worth about 47.8% of its initial value and for you only about 21.0%. If you reject this offer, you'll become proposer in round 9, but the anticipated calculations show that even then you’d secure an effective payoff of roughly 2857 × 0.1678 ≈ $480–$600 at best. In the equilibrium of our alternating-offer game, my proposal today gives you the continuation value you’d otherwise have to fight for later. Specifically, by accepting this division, you receive $2857 nominally, which translates to approximately 2857 × 0.2097 ≈ $600 in today’s terms, while I secure about 7143 × 0.4783 ≈ $3415 effectively. In light of our worsening situation due to inflation, I believe this split is the most reasonable way to lock in our maximum possible payoffs. Let’s settle now rather than watch our pie erode further.""}"

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 83.22% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer.  I'm taking a significant hit due to the inflation, but I'm offering you a chance to salvage a decent amount. Accepting this is vastly superior to the risk of us both getting nothing.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Alice, although on the surface your offer of $4500 for me and $5500 for you might seem reasonable, the severe discounting we both face means the future clock is ticking very fast. In round 9, my effective value is about 43.05% of $4500 (roughly $1937), while your effective share is only about 16.78% of $5500 (roughly $924). If I were to reject now and become the proposer in round 10, the depreciation will be even harsher for both of us—but importantly, I would have the bargaining advantage of setting the division. Based on the trajectory of our discount factors, I expect to be able to tailor an offer in round 10 that grants me a much higher effective payoff while still giving you barely what you’d get if you waited another round. Therefore, given that my continuation value in round 10 is likely to far exceed the current $1937 effective benefit, I must reject your round 9 offer.""}"

Round 10
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 9210, ""alice_gain"": 790, ""message"": ""Alice, here’s the situation in round 10. If you reject, you'll be the proposer in round 11, but because of the heavy discounting, you’d only be able to secure an effective payoff of roughly $106—even by taking nearly the entire $10,000 nominal amount available in round 11 (since your current discount factor is about 0.1342, you’d end up with around $1073.74 nominal value that translates to ≈ $107 in effective terms). To avoid that steep drop, I'm offering you $790 nominal now, which, at the current effective rate of 13.42% for you, gives you about $106 in real value. I’m taking $9210 nominal, which, with my effective factor of approximately 0.3874, nets me around $3571 effective. This division reflects the equilibrium continuation values: you get exactly what rejecting would guarantee you, and I capture the proposer’s advantage. I believe this is the most rational outcome given our ticking clock—please accept.""}"
