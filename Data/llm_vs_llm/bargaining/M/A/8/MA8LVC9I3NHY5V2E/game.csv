900000.0,100000.0,Let's start with a strong offer. I believe this is a fair division for both of us.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Hi Alice, I understand we both want to maximize our gains, but your initial offer was quite unbalanced. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, which accounts for the 10% inflation penalty I face each round. This is still very generous to you, as a fair split under these conditions would actually favor me more. Let's reach an agreement quickly so we both benefit.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
700000.0,300000.0,I'm making a more balanced proposal this time. I think this split will be more acceptable for both of us.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I appreciate the improved offer, but I'm still facing significant inflation pressure (already 27% by next round). This 55/45 split in my favor is actually quite fair considering this disadvantage. If we continue going back and forth, we both lose value. Let's reach an agreement now that's mutually beneficial - this offer is more balanced than it might appear due to my inflation penalty.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
600000.0,400000.0,Let's try for a compromise. This is a better offer that acknowledges the inflation issues we've faced while still being fair. I hope we can agree this time.,Alice,5,
