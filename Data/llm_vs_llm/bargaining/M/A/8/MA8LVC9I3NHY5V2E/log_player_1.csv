"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand we both want to maximize our gains, but your initial offer was quite unbalanced. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, which accounts for the 10% inflation penalty I face each round. This is still very generous to you, as a fair split under these conditions would actually favor me more. Let's reach an agreement quickly so we both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the improved offer, but I'm still facing significant inflation pressure (already 27% by next round). This 55/45 split in my favor is actually quite fair considering this disadvantage. If we continue going back and forth, we both lose value. Let's reach an agreement now that's mutually beneficial - this offer is more balanced than it might appear due to my inflation penalty. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000
