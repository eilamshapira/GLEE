"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a strong offer. I believe this is a fair division for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $100,000 out of the $1,000,000, which means she would get $900,000. That's only 10% for me.

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round. However, I should account for the 10% inflation that affects me each round. If I reject now, my maximum potential value in the next round would be $900,000 (after 10% inflation).

This offer seems quite low and favors Alice significantly. I should reject and propose a more balanced division.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced division that acknowledges the inflation pressure I'm under while still being fair to both of us.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand we both want to maximize our gains, but your initial offer was quite unbalanced. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, which accounts for the 10% inflation penalty I face each round. This is still very generous to you, as a fair split under these conditions would actually favor me more. Let's reach an agreement quickly so we both benefit.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm making a more balanced proposal this time. I think this split will be more acceptable for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me evaluate this offer carefully.

Alice is now offering me $300,000 out of the $1,000,000, which is 30% of the total. This is better than her first offer but still significantly favors her.

Due to inflation, this $300,000 is worth about $243,000 to me (after the 19% reduction from inflation). If I reject, I'll face another 10% inflation in the next round.

While this offer is an improvement, it's still not balanced considering the inflation penalty I face. I believe we can reach a more equitable agreement.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the improved offer, but I'm still facing significant inflation pressure (already 27% by next round). This 55/45 split in my favor is actually quite fair considering this disadvantage. If we continue going back and forth, we both lose value. Let's reach an agreement now that's mutually beneficial - this offer is more balanced than it might appear due to my inflation penalty.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try for a compromise. This is a better offer that acknowledges the inflation issues we've faced while still being fair. I hope we can agree this time. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

Alice is now offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000, which is 40% of the total. This is better than her previous offers.

Due to inflation, this $400,000 is worth about $262,440 to me (after the 34.39% reduction from inflation). If I reject, I'll face another 10% inflation in the next round.

We're now in round 5 out of 12 possible rounds. If we continue to go back and forth, the inflation will significantly reduce the value for me, and we risk getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement by round 12.

This offer represents a reasonable compromise given the inflation pressure I'm under and the progress in negotiations.
