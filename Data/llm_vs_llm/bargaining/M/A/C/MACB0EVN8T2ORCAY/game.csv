50.0,50.0,"Hi Bob, how about we split the $100 evenly? I propose a 50/50 division so we can seal the deal quickly and avoid any inflation loss on my side. I believe this fair split benefits both of us!",Alice,1,

40.0,60.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think I deserve a bit more. Considering the inflation, I'd like to propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This way, we both still get a significant amount, and we can conclude the deal before the money loses more value.",Bob,2,

45.0,55.0,"Hi Bob, I understand your aim for a bigger slice, and while further delay would help you if you're unaffected by inflation, it hurts me significantly. To avoid another round and the extra devaluation on my side, I propose a 45/55 split now. I believe this is a fair compromise given the circumstancesâ€”we resolve the deal quickly, and you secure a slightly larger share. I hope you'll agree to close the deal today.",Alice,3,
