"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, how about we split the $100 evenly? I propose a 50/50 division so we can seal the deal quickly and avoid any inflation loss on my side. I believe this fair split benefits both of us! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, 
""alice_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think I deserve a bit more. Considering the inflation, I'd like to propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This way, we both still get a significant amount, and we can conclude the deal before the money loses more value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your aim for a bigger slice, and while further delay would help you if you're unaffected by inflation, it hurts me significantly. To avoid another round and the extra devaluation on my side, I propose a 45/55 split now. I believe this is a fair compromise given the circumstancesâ€”we resolve the deal quickly, and you secure a slightly larger share. I hope you'll agree to close the deal today. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
