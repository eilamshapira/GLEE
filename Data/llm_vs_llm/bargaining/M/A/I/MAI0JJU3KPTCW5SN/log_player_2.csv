"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we both get a good share. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing an even 50-50 split, which would give me $5,000. While this might seem fair on the surface, I need to account for the 5% inflation penalty I face each round.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value will be worth 5% less to me. So if I want to maximize my gain, I should consider that time pressure affects me more than Alice.

An even split in round 1 gives me $5,000 right now, which is a substantial amount. If I reject and try for more, I risk losing value due to inflation and potentially ending with less if negotiations drag on.
