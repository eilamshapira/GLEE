"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly to build trust for future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. It's a fair 50-50 split
2. The money is worth its full value in round 1
3. If I reject, the next offer will be worth 5% less (950,000$ total)
4. Even if I could get a better deal next round, the loss in value might not be worth it
5. Starting with cooperation could lead to better outcomes
