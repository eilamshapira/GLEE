6000.0,4000.0,I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first move and taking initiative. This is a fair offer that leaves you with a substantial amount.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,I think a 55-45 split is a fair compromise. It acknowledges your initial lead but also gives me a slightly better share since I'm now the one proposing.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,accept
