"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is a fair compromise. It acknowledges your initial lead but also gives me a slightly better share since I'm now the one proposing. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer. While it's slightly less favorable than my initial proposal, the 10% inflation penalty makes it better to accept now than to continue negotiating. Getting $4,500 now is better than risking further devaluation of the total amount in subsequent rounds."
