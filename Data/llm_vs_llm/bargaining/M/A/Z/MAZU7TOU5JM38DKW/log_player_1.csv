"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll propose a fair split while considering that Bob loses more value in later rounds due to higher inflation.

{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I suggest a reasonable split where we both get a good portion. If we delay, you'll lose more value due to your 10% inflation rate, while I only lose 5%.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it equally. Even with the 10% inflation for me, it's still a fair deal considering your 5% inflation. We both get a reasonable amount, and we can end the game on good terms. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Due to inflation, if I accept now:
   - My $50 is worth $47.5 (5% less)
   - Bob's $50 is worth $45 (10% less)

2. If I reject and make a new offer in the next round:
   - Further inflation will apply
   - I might be able to negotiate a better deal, but there's risk

3. This is actually a reasonable offer considering:
   - It's close to a fair split
   - The inflation factor isn't too severe yet
   - Prolonging the game could lead to worse outcomes for both
