Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose an even 50-50 split. This is the fairest division, and we should agree now before inflation reduces our total. We both walk away with equal amounts. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
