"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split it 60-40. This way, we both get a good amount before inflation kicks in. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if this offer is fair.

Alice is proposing a 60-40 split in her favor. While it's not an even split, accepting now would give me $40 and avoid inflation. If I reject, we move to the next round where I can make a counter-offer, but the total value will decrease by 20% to $80.

Given that I'll be able to make the offer next round and inflation will reduce the total amount, I think I can propose a more favorable split.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more balanced while acknowledging the inflation risk.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""I propose an even 50-50 split. This is the fairest division, and we should agree now before inflation reduces our total. We both walk away with equal amounts.""}"
