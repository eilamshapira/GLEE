"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering me $4,000 out of the $10,000 total, which is 40%. This isn't a terrible offer, but I could potentially get more if I make a counter-proposal. However, I need to consider that the money will be worth 5% less in the next round due to inflation.

If I reject, I'll be able to make my own proposal, but the total value to me will only be $9,500 ($10,000 Ã— 0.95). I think I can propose a better split for myself that Alice might still accept.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more favorable to me but still reasonable enough that Alice might accept it rather than risking further rounds of inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering a 55/45 split in my favor. This gives me $5,500, which is better than the $4,000 Alice offered me in round 1. For Alice, getting $4,500 now might be preferable to risking another round of negotiation, especially if she's also affected by inflation."
