"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. Given that we face inflation in each round, it's best for both of us to reach an agreement early. This is a fair offer considering the time pressure we're under.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice! Let's keep it simple and fair with an even 50/50 split. This way, we both walk away with equal shares now, avoiding any risks from inflation. Hope you agree! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
