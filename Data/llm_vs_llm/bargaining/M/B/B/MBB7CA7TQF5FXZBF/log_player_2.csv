"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer carefully.

She's proposing that I get $40 while she gets $60 out of the $100. While this isn't an equal split, it's not terribly unfair either. 

I need to think strategically here. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but there's no guarantee Alice will accept it. Since we have a limited number of rounds (12) and we both get nothing if we can't agree, I should weigh whether this offer is reasonable enough to accept now.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more balanced while still being reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I propose an equal split of the money, which is the fairest division. We each get $50, which represents an equitable outcome for both of us. This even division eliminates any advantage for either player and allows us both to benefit equally from the available funds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Alice has moved her offer in my direction, now proposing I get $45 while she gets $55. This is more balanced than her initial offer and shows she's willing to compromise.

While I could reject and counter with another offer, we're already in round 3 of 12, and there's value in reaching an agreement rather than risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds.

Given that she's moved toward a more equitable split, I'll accept this offer.
