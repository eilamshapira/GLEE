Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While this offer is slightly worse than Alice's initial offer, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for Alice. It's highly likely she'll propose a better offer in the next round to avoid being left with a significantly smaller amount."

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is significantly impacting Alice now.  While her offer isn't ideal, it's getting close to a point where I might have to accept to avoid getting even less later.  My rejections are likely pushing her towards a more agreeable split."

This is a tough one. Alice is getting very close to a 50/50 split. However, the inflation is hurting her much more than me. I believe I can squeeze out a slightly better deal in the next round or two."
