"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. I think it's a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
- She's proposing I get $45, while she gets $55
- This is slightly in her favor, but not extremely unfair
- With no inflation affecting my value, $45 is still $45
- Rejecting means I can make a counter-offer, but also risks further negotiation rounds
- A 45/55 split is relatively reasonable as a starting point

I'll accept this offer since it's fairly reasonable and guarantees me a decent amount rather than risking further negotiations.
