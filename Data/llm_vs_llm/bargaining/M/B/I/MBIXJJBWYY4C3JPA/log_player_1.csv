"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll think strategically about this. Given the different inflation rates (5% for me, 10% for Bob), it's in both our interests to reach an agreement sooner rather than later, though the timing pressure affects Bob more strongly.

Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose you get $450,000 and I take $550,000. This is slightly in my favor, but still gives you a substantial portion. Given the accelerating losses from inflation, we should try to agree early, and this is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
