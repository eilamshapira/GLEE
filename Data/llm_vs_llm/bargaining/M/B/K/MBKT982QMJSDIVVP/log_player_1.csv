"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my first offer in this negotiation game, considering the 20% inflation penalty per round for me.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose an equal split of the $10,000. This is a fair starting point that gives us both an equal share, and allows us to avoid the inflation penalty of continuing to further rounds."
