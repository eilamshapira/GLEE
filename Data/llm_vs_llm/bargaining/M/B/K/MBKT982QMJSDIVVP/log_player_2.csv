"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

A 50-50 split is generally fair, but with the 20% inflation penalty per round, I need to consider this carefully.

If I reject and propose in the next round:
- The $5000 would be worth only $4000 due to 20% inflation
- I'd need to offer Alice something attractive enough to accept
- There's risk of further rounds and more value loss

Given that:
1. This is a fair initial offer
2. The inflation penalty makes future rounds less valuable for me
3. There's risk in prolonging negotiations
