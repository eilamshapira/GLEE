"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. Here's my proposal for round 1, keeping in mind the rapidly decreasing value of the money:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

**Rationale:**

*   **Front-loading:** I'm offering Alice (myself) a larger share now because the value degrades faster for Bob than for me initially. Securing more value upfront is crucial.
*   **Incentive for Bob:** Bob still gets a significant $4000, which is a substantial amount considering the time constraint and potential for losing everything.
*   **Fairness:** While I'm prioritizing my gain, the split isn't outrageously unfair, hopefully increasing the chances of acceptance. I need to get to a deal quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6200 
# Bob gain: 3800 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to carefully consider this offer, taking inflation into account. My money is worth 90% of what it was, and Bob's is worth 80%.

Let's compare this offer to what I proposed and the initial pot of money:

*   **Initial Pot:** $10,000
*   **My Round 1 Offer:** $6,000 to me, $4,000 to Bob
*   **Bob's Round 2 Offer:** $6,200 to me, $3,800 to Bob

If I reject, I have to consider what I would offer Bob, which he may reject. Given that Bob has offered a greater amount than my starting offer, and given that I know inflation is only going to get worse for the next 10 rounds, I am deciding to accept.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
