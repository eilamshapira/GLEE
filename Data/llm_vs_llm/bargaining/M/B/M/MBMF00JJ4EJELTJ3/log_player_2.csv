"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the actual value I'm considering is $10,000 * 0.8 = $8,000. However, the nominal amount remains $10,000. I'll make an offer that is slightly more favorable to Alice than a 50/50 split would be after accounting for the value reduction.
