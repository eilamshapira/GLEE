"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer, taking into account the 5% inflation penalty I face with each round. If I reject, I'll make a counter-offer in round 2, but the total will already be worth 5% less to me.

Alice has offered an even 50/50 split, which seems fair at first glance. However, given that I face inflation while Alice doesn't, this might not be optimal for me in the long run.

If I accept now, I get $50.
If I reject and counter-offer, I'd need to get more than $52.63 in the next round to make up for the 5% inflation (since $52.63 Ã— 0.95 = $50).

Given this is just the first round and a 50/50 split is generally considered fair, I'll accept this offer.
