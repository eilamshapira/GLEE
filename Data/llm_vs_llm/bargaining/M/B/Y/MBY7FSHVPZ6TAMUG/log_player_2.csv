"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I propose we split it 60-40 in my favor. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 10% less to me. So $40 now is worth more than any amount in the next round multiplied by 0.9.

Even if I could get $60 in the next round, it would only be worth $54 to me due to inflation. The current offer of $40 is better than that.

Therefore, I should accept this offer.
