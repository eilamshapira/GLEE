"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair initial offer, aiming for an even split since cooperation tends to yield better results than aggressive negotiation, especially with the 20% inflation penalty for additional rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose a 50-50 split, which is fair to both parties and avoids the risk of value loss through inflation in subsequent rounds."
