"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it equally, it's fair and square. Next round the money will be worth less for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I need to consider the actual value of the offer.

The original amount I would get is $5000, but due to inflation, it's worth 20% less, so the actual value is $5000 * 0.8 = $4000.

Considering this, I think I can get a better deal if I wait.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less now, I'll try to get a better deal.

For me, the original $10,000 is now worth $10,000 * 0.8 * 0.8 = $6,400 (20% less in Round 1 and another 20% less in Round 2).
For Bob, the original $10,000 is now worth $10,000 * 0.9 * 0.9 = $8,100 (10% less in Round 1 and another 10% less in Round 2).

I'll offer Bob a bit less than half of the original amount, considering the decreased value.

{""alice_gain"": 6500, 
""bob_gain"": 3500, 
""message"": ""Last chance for a good deal, don't let it slip away""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair deal considering the inflation. Let's settle now before the money loses more value. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 48.8% less, I need to consider the actual value of the offer.

The original amount I would get is $5500, but due to inflation, it's worth $5500 * (1 - 0.488) = $5500 * 0.512 = $2816.

Considering this, I think I should accept the offer, as the value of the money will continue to decrease if I reject it.
