"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 7916.67 
# Alice gain: 2083.33 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. 

Alice is offering me $7,916.67 out of the $10,000, which is about 79% of the total. 

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, I need to consider that:
1. The money will be worth 5% less to me
2. The money will be worth 20% less to Alice

Given the significant inflation penalty for Alice (20%), she has a stronger incentive to reach an agreement quickly. My inflation penalty is much lower at 5%.

If I reject this round and offer in the next round, I could potentially get a better deal. However, this current offer already gives me a substantial majority of the money.

Considering that this is a good offer giving me nearly 80% of the total amount, I'll accept.
