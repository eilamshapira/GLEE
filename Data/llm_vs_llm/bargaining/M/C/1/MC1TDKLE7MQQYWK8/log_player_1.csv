"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Based on a backward‐induction analysis of the alternating–offer procedure (with 12 rounds) where the “real” value of any dollars is discounted by 5% per round for you (Alice) and 10% per round for Bob, the subgame–perfect equilibrium outcome in round 1 turns out to be roughly as follows:

• In round 12 (last round), Bob (as proposer) could offer you almost nothing, keeping nearly all 1,000,000 dollars for himself.
• Working backward one round at a time (and “translating” the responder’s future guaranteed payoff into current‐round nominal dollars using the appropriate discount factor: multiply by 0.95 for you when you are the responder, and 0.90 for Bob), the equilibrium proposal in round 1 (your turn) ends up needing to give Bob at least about 579,763 dollars so that Bob’s effective payoff now matches what he would get by waiting and proposing in round 2.
• In that case you keep the remainder, namely about 420,237 dollars.

Thus, our equilibrium offer in round 1 is approximately:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 420237,
  ""bob_gain"": 579763
}

You can send the offer in the JSON format as requested."
