"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. Alice is offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000, which is 40% of the total. If I reject, I'll get to make a counter-offer in the next round, but due to inflation, the money will be worth 10% less to me. That means the $1,000,000 will effectively be worth $900,000 to me in the next round.

If I reject and counter-offer in the next round, I would need to get more than $444,444 (which is equivalent to $400,000 now after accounting for 10% inflation) to make rejection worthwhile. However, I don't know how inflation affects Alice, and there's risk in rejection if Alice might reject my counter-offer.

Given that $400,000 is a substantial amount, and the risk of continued negotiations with inflation affecting me, I'll accept this offer.
