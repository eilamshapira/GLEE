"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether this offer is fair or if I should proceed to make a counter-offer.

Alice is offering me 4000$ out of 10,000$ (40%), while keeping 6000$ (60%) for herself. If I reject and move to the next round, the money will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation, meaning the total value to me would be 9500$ instead of 10,000$.

If I make a counter-offer in the next round, I could propose a more favorable split for myself. However, I need to factor in that 5% depreciation.

Given that Alice faces no depreciation penalty and the split is not 50-50, I'll make a counter-offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll now make my counter-proposal. I need to consider that the money is now worth 5% less to me (but not to Alice), so the effective value to me is $9,500.

I'll aim for a more balanced split, acknowledging the inflation penalty while making a reasonable offer to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. This gives us both equal amounts and acknowledges that I've already taken a 5% inflation hit by rejecting your first offer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a better deal for you than my first offer 
# Bob gain: 3900 
# Alice gain: 6100 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to analyze this offer carefully considering the inflation effect.

Alice is now offering me $3900 (39%) while keeping $6100 (61%) for herself. With the 9.75% inflation penalty, my $3900 is effectively worth $3519.75 to me (3900 × 0.9025).

If I reject and move to round 4, the money will depreciate further for me, to about 14.75% less than the original value. 

Let's compare:
- Current offer: I get $3900, worth $3519.75 to me after inflation
- If I reject and eventually get $5000 in the next round, it would be worth about $4262.50 to me (5000 × 0.8525)

However, there's no guarantee Alice would accept a better offer, and further rejections would decrease my value even more. Alice seems to be slightly lowering her demands (from 60% to 61%) despite her stronger position.

Given the depreciation I'm facing and the risk of further losses, I'll accept this offer.
