"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, for this first round I propose that I receive $60 and you receive $40. I believe this forward-thinking split takes into account our roles in making proposals and sets us up well if we reach further rounds. Let me know your thoughts!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation, I think a more balanced split is needed. I propose 55 for me and 45 for you. This way, we both get a decent amount, and it's more fair given the decreasing value of money. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
