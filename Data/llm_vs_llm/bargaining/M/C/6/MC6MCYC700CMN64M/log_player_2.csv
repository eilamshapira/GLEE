Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, for this first round I propose that I receive $60 and you receive $40. I believe this forward-thinking split takes into account our roles in making proposals and sets us up well if we reach further rounds. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
