60.0,40.0,"I suggest a fair 60-40 split. Given that your money loses value faster than mine (20% vs 5% per round), it's in your interest to accept this reasonable offer now.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
35.0,65.0,"Let's be reasonable. I propose 65-35. My money is losing value quickly. This gives you a good return, considering.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"I'm compromising from my initial offer. With your 20% value loss per round, this 45% now is worth more than a higher amount later. Let's make a deal and both benefit.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
30.0,70.0,"This is my best offer: 70-30. My money is losing value fast. Take it, or we both lose.",Bob,4,

58.0,42.0,"Bob, let's be practical. Your share has already lost almost 50% of its value. This 42% now is worth much more than a larger share later. Time is not on your side with your 20% loss per round. This is a fair offer that benefits us both.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
25.0,75.0,Final offer: 75-25. My losses are too great to go any further. This is the best you'll get.,Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
65.0,35.0,"Bob, let's do the math. Your 35% now is worth more than 75% in the next round due to your 20% per round loss. Your current share has lost over 67% of value already. If we keep going, we both lose. This is your best option now - take it.",Alice,7,
