"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""I suggest a fair 60-40 split. Given that your money loses value faster than mine (20% vs 5% per round), it's in your interest to accept this reasonable offer now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. I propose 65-35. My money is losing value quickly. This gives you a good return, considering. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The money is worth less now, but Bob's asking for too much. Since his money loses value much faster than mine (20% vs 5% per round), I have stronger negotiating position. I'll make a better counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""I'm compromising from my initial offer. With your 20% value loss per round, this 45% now is worth more than a higher amount later. Let's make a deal and both benefit.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my best offer: 70-30. My money is losing value fast. Take it, or we both lose. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer is getting worse despite his money losing value much faster. With his 48.8% loss in value already, he should be more reasonable. I'll make a more compelling offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, 
""bob_gain"": 42, 
""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical. Your share has already lost almost 50% of its value. This 42% now is worth much more than a larger share later. Time is not on your side with your 20% loss per round. This is a fair offer that benefits us both.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Final offer: 75-25. My losses are too great to go any further. This is the best you'll get. 
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offers are getting worse despite his rapidly deteriorating position. His 75% share has lost 67.23% of its value, meaning it's only worth about 24.5% of the original value, while my potential 25% share has only lost 22.62% of its value (worth about 19.3% of original). I'll make a more reasonable offer next round."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 65, 
""bob_gain"": 35, 
""message"": ""Bob, let's do the math. Your 35% now is worth more than 75% in the next round due to your 20% per round loss. Your current share has lost over 67% of value already. If we keep going, we both lose. This is your best option now - take it.""}"
