"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split this reasonably. I'm offering you a generous 45% share. Consider that with inflation, delays will hurt both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe a 47.5% to 52.5% split is more reasonable, given the significant impact of inflation on my end. Let's settle this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The reasoning behind accepting:
1. The offer is fairly reasonable, giving me $525,000
2. With inflation reducing my value by 10% each round, my $525,000 in round 2 is worth $472,500
3. If I reject and we continue to later rounds, inflation will keep eating into the value
4. Bob's offer is a reasonable compromise from my initial proposal
5. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk further value loss through negotiation"
