"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get your money immediately without any inflation impact.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose an equal 50-50 split. This way, we both benefit equally and reach an agreement quickly. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
* Due to 10% inflation, if I accept this offer, $50 would actually be worth $45 to me
* If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount I get will be worth 20% less
* Bob is offering an equal split, which is generally considered fair
* Waiting longer will only decrease the value further for me
* Getting $45 in real value is better than risking further depreciation
