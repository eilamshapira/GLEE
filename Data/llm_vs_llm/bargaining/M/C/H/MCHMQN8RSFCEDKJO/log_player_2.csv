"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. It's a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
2. However, if I reject, I can make my own offer next round
3. With 10% inflation per round, if I reject, the $5000 I could get now would be worth $4500 in the next round
4. Making a counter-offer might risk Alice rejecting and leading to further rounds with more value loss
5. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush

Given these considerations, I'll accept the fair split rather than risk losing value to inflation.
