Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor as I'm making the first move and taking initiative. This is still a fair offer giving you a substantial $4,000.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, given the discount incurred by waiting, I believe a near-fair split is best for both of us. Accepting now gives you $4900—slightly above what you could expect on your turn later—so let's secure our gains before further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
