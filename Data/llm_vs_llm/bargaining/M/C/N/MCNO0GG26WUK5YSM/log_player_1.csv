"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's start with a more balanced offer. 55-45 for me. We need to be reasonable to secure some money for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of 45-55 split. It's a reasonable counter-offer and fairly balanced. There's no guarantee that continuing negotiations would lead to a better outcome for me, and we shouldn't risk getting nothing by dragging this out too long."
