"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get a substantial portion.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I think 55-45 is a more reasonable split. We both get a significant amount, and it's better to agree now than to lose value in the next rounds. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Reasoning (not part of response):
This is a good offer to accept because:
1. With 20% inflation for my share, waiting another round would reduce my purchasing power significantly
2. 45$ now is better than potentially getting a higher nominal amount that's worth less due to inflation
3. Bob made a reasonable counter-offer that's not too far from my initial proposal
4. The risk of continued negotiation could lead to both of us getting nothing if we can't agree within the rounds limit"
