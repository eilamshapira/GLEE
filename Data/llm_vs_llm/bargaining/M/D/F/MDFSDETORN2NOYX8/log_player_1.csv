"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's keep it simple and fair by dividing the money equally. This way, we both benefit equally without risking further inflation losses. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The 50-50 split is fair, and with the 20% inflation already affecting this round, accepting now is better than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds. Taking $500,000 (worth $400,000 after this round's inflation) is a reasonable outcome."
