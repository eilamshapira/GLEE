"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

My reasoning is that going first gives me a slight advantage, and this split is still fair enough that Bob will hopefully accept it to avoid the risk of further inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I will consider the inflation and Bob's offer. The $40 he's offering me is now worth $40 * 0.8 = $32 relative to round 1. He is offering me less than I offered him in the first round. I am going to reject this offer, but I want to be strategic.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, it's my turn to make an offer again. Considering the inflation, I need to be more reasonable. I'll still try to get a bit more, but not too greedy. This round the money is worth 64% of the first round.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
