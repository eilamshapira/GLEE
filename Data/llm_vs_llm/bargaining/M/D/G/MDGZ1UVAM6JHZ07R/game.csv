60.0,40.0,"Let's be fair - I'll take 60%, you take 40%. This is a good deal considering inflation will hurt you more than me in later rounds.",Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Let's split the difference.  I'll take 55% and you take 45%.  This is a more even split, and we can avoid the risk of inflation eroding our potential gains.",Bob,2,

65.0,35.0,"Time is working against both of us, but especially you with 20% inflation. This 65-35 split is actually generous considering your rapidly diminishing returns. Let's conclude this now.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
55.0,45.0,"Alice, we're both losing money with each round.  Let's be practical.  I'll take 45% and you can have 55%. This is a compromise that gives us both a better share than the last round.",Bob,4,
