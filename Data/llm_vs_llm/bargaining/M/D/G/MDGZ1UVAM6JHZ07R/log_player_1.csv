"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair - I'll take 60%, you take 40%. This is a good deal considering inflation will hurt you more than me in later rounds.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the difference.  I'll take 55% and you take 45%.  This is a more even split, and we can avoid the risk of inflation eroding our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Let me explain my reasoning (not part of the game response): With inflation affecting Bob more severely (20% vs my 10%), I should have more bargaining power. Also, my previous offer of 60-40 was more favorable to me, and Bob's counteroffer of 45-55 is actually worse for me. I'll make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Time is working against both of us, but especially you with 20% inflation. This 65-35 split is actually generous considering your rapidly diminishing returns. Let's conclude this now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing money with each round.  Let's be practical.  I'll take 45% and you can have 55%. This is a compromise that gives us both a better share than the last round. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Let me explain my reasoning (not part of the game response): This is a reasonable offer. While I could try to push for more, the inflation is starting to significantly impact both of us. Bob has moved from wanting 55% to accepting 45%, and I'm getting a fair 55%. Given that we're already in round 4 and the money is worth notably less for both of us, it's wise to accept this offer now rather than risk further devaluation."
