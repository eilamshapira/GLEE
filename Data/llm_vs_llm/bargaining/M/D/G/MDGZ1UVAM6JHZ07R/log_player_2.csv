Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is working against both of us, but especially you with 20% inflation. This 65-35 split is actually generous considering your rapidly diminishing returns. Let's conclude this now. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65
