"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 70,
""bob_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Bob. Take this offer and we both walk away with something.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Initial Offer:**  Starting with a 70/30 split in Alice's favor establishes a firm position. It's significantly better for Alice if accepted immediately.
* **Leveraging Impatience:** Bob's money loses value faster (20% per round).  This offer aims to exploit Bob's potential impatience and desire to secure something quickly. 
* **Setting the Tone:**  The message is direct but not overly aggressive. It suggests a pragmatic approach, hoping Bob will see accepting as the most rational choice."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This accounts for the inflation impacting me more. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer acknowledges the inflation disparity, it's still heavily skewed in his favor. Accepting now would mean settling for a significantly smaller portion than what Alice aimed for in Round 1. By rejecting, Alice forces Bob to experience another round of substantial inflation, making him potentially more open to a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Bob. This is a compromise offer - take it before the inflation eats away even more of your potential winnings.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Alice reduces her demand slightly from the initial 70/30 to 65/35, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Exploiting Time Pressure:**  The message emphasizes the ongoing devaluation of the money, particularly for Bob. This aims to create urgency and nudge him towards accepting a deal now.
* **Balancing Act:**  Alice is aiming for a balance between maximizing her share and securing a deal. The offer is still significantly in her favor but acknowledges the need to find a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. It's a reasonable 55/45 split considering the inflation is hurting my share considerably each round. Let's end this now and both get something. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:**  While not ideal, accepting a 45/55 split in Round 4 is better than risking another rejection and further inflation. The potential gains from holding out are shrinking rapidly.
* **Bob's Ultimatum:** Bob's language suggests this is his final offer. Rejecting it carries a high risk of him walking away entirely, leaving Alice with nothing.
* **Realistic Assessment:** Alice's initial target was ambitious.  Bob has consistently sought a larger share. Accepting this offer secures Alice a reasonable amount, even if it's less than initially desired. 

It's a tough decision, but in a negotiation with rapidly changing stakes, sometimes a good deal now is better than the risk of nothing later."
