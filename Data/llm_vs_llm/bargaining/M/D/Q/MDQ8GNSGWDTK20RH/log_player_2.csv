This is a tough decision, and it's getting close to crunch time. Here's my reasoning:

* **Time Pressure:**  We're at round 5 of 12. Alice's offers are getting better, but the inflation is hurting her much more than me.
* **Future Offers:** I think I can push for a slightly better deal in the next round or two. Alice is getting desperate. 
* **Minimum Acceptable:** At this point, I'd want at least 60% of the pot to make up for the inflation losses I've incurred.

Let's see if Alice panics a bit more!"

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.

It's time to take the deal.  Alice is unlikely to offer me a better split considering the significant impact inflation is having on her share. Accepting now secures a reasonable amount before inflation eats further into the overall value."
