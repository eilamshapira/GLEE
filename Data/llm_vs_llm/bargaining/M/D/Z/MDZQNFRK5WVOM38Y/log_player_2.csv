"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split ($5000 each)
2. This is a completely fair division
3. If I reject, I'll get to make a counter-offer, but:
   - The money maintains its value for me
   - I don't know how inflation affects Alice
   - There's no guarantee Alice will accept my counter-offer

Given that this is a fair split and there's uncertainty in future rounds, accepting this offer seems like the rational choice.
