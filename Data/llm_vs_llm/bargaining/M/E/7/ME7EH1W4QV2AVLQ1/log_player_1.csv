"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $600,000 and giving Bob $400,000, with a message suggesting this is a fair starting point. Your turn to respond as Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm offering a 50/50 split. It's the fairest deal we can make. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less to me due to inflation, the $500,000 I would gain is actually worth $400,000 in terms of its original value.

Considering this, a 50/50 split might not be as favorable to me as it would have been in the first round. However, it's still a significant amount, and I don't know how the inflation affects Bob's perception of the value.

My response:

```
