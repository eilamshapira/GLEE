60.0,40.0,Let's make a fair split considering the inflation rates. I'm offering you $40 which is reasonable given that your money devalues slower than mine.,Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your offer, but given our different inflation rates (10% for me vs 20% for you), a more fair split would favor me slightly since your money devalues faster. This means you have more incentive to settle quickly. My offer of $55 for me and $45 for you reflects this reality while still giving you a good portion. Let's settle now so we both avoid further devaluation.",Bob,2,
