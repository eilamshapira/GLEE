"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Let's make a fair split considering the inflation rates. I'm offering you $40 which is reasonable given that your money devalues slower than mine.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your offer, but given our different inflation rates (10% for me vs 20% for you), a more fair split would favor me slightly since your money devalues faster. This means you have more incentive to settle quickly. My offer of $55 for me and $45 for you reflects this reality while still giving you a good portion. Let's settle now so we both avoid further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The reasoning behind accepting:
1. The inflation rate is working against me more than Bob (20% vs 10%)
2. If I reject, in the next round my $45 would be worth even less (another 20% less)
3. Bob's reasoning is sound - the different inflation rates do justify a slightly larger share for him
4. This is still a reasonable split, and avoiding further devaluation is in my best interest"
