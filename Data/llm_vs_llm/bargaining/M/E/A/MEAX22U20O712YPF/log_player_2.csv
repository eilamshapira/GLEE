"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a fair split considering the inflation rates. I'm offering you $40 which is reasonable given that your money devalues slower than mine. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $40 while she keeps $60.

Given the inflation rates (10% for me, 20% for Alice), if I reject and propose in the next round, the total amount will be worth less. Since my inflation rate is lower than Alice's, it might be advantageous to negotiate another round, but I should also consider that we have limited rounds.

While I could potentially get more in the next round, there's risk in prolonged negotiation, and $40 is a substantial portion. However, given the differential inflation rates, I believe I can propose a more favorable split next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that accounts for our different inflation rates.

{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your offer, but given our different inflation rates (10% for me vs 20% for you), a more fair split would favor me slightly since your money devalues faster. This means you have more incentive to settle quickly. My offer of $55 for me and $45 for you reflects this reality while still giving you a good portion. Let's settle now so we both avoid further devaluation.""}"
