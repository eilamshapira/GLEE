"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The offer of $100,000 is too low for a fair split of $1,000,000. Even with the 10% inflation penalty per round, I can propose a more equitable distribution in the next round. The current offer gives Alice 90% of the total amount, which is extremely unbalanced."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000}

I propose a near-equal split, slightly favoring Alice to incentivize acceptance. This is a fair offer considering that any further delay will reduce the value of my share due to the 10% inflation penalty per round. A 45%-55% split is much more reasonable than the previous 10%-90% proposal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. Here's why:
- With 19% inflation, my $300,000 is worth $243,000 in round 1 terms
- If I reject, the next round will have 27.1% inflation for me
- If we continue negotiating, my bargaining power decreases each round due to the asymmetric inflation
- This offer is significantly better than Alice's first offer ($100,000)
- While not ideal, it's better to accept now than risk further value loss"
