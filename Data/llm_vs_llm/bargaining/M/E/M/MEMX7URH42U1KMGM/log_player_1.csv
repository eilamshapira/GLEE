Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 50,""bob_gain"": 50,""message"": ""Let's start with an equal division of the money.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, to counter the impact of inflation, I’m proposing this division: I receive $34.48 and you $65.52. Given how much the pie will shrink in value if we delay further – with my share worth only 90% and yours 95% in this round – this offer gives you about 0.95 × 65.52 ≈ $62.24 in effective value. That’s exactly what you’d expect by waiting and proposing in the next round. I believe this fair division protects both our interests and avoids extra loss. Please accept this proposal. 
# Alice gain: 65.52 
# Bob gain: 34.48 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
