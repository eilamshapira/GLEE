"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 34.48, ""alice_gain"": 65.52, ""message"": ""Alice, to counter the impact of inflation, I’m proposing this division: I receive $34.48 and you $65.52. Given how much the pie will shrink in value if we delay further – with my share worth only 90% and yours 95% in this round – this offer gives you about 0.95 × 65.52 ≈ $62.24 in effective value. That’s exactly what you’d expect by waiting and proposing in the next round. I believe this fair division protects both our interests and avoids extra loss. Please accept this proposal.""}"
