I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. I think this is a fair starting point, given that I'm the one initiating the negotiation.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

I'm going to counter Bob's offer.  Since he rejected my initial proposal, I'm willing to budge a bit, but I'm still hoping to get a slightly larger share. Let's see if he's willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Okay, I'm accepting this offer.  While the inflation is making my share worth less than in the first round, it's getting progressively worse with each round.  I'd rather take what I can get now than risk losing more money by continuing to negotiate."
