"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to make an offer to divide $1,000,000 between myself (Alice) and Bob. Since there's 5% inflation for me each round but 0% for Bob, I should make a reasonable first offer that Bob is likely to accept, as waiting is more costly for me than for him.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this division because it gives me a slight advantage while still being quite fair to Bob. Since we're in the first round and I face inflation penalties in future rounds, I believe this offer balances my interests with Bob's while giving him significant incentive to accept rather than counter."
