"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. Let's try to reach a fair split - how about a 50/50 division? This way, we both get the same amount while considering the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
