Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 60-40 split in my favor. Given that inflation affects me more (10% vs your 5%), this split will help balance the impact over time. This way we both walk away with a fair share considering our different inflation rates.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I believe a 55-45 split in my favor is more equitable considering the inflation rates. This way, we both get a fair share while accounting for the different impacts of inflation over the future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

With my 10% inflation rate versus your 5%, I'm losing value faster. A 55-45 split in my favor is actually fair in the long run. If we continue for several more rounds, we'll both lose significantly more money. Let's reach an agreement now where we both get substantial value.""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see your point, but I think a 52-48 split in my favor is fairer considering the accumulated inflation effects. Let's find a middle ground and settle this to avoid further losses for both of us.
