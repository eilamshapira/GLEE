"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 60-40 split in my favor. Given that inflation affects me more (10% vs your 5%), this split will help balance the impact over time. This way we both walk away with a fair share considering our different inflation rates. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000

Round 2

However, I believe a 55-45 split in my favor is more equitable considering the inflation rates. This way, we both get a fair share while accounting for the different impacts of inflation over the future rounds.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counterproposal, but let me explain why we should reconsider. With my 10% inflation rate versus your 5%, I'm losing value faster. A 55-45 split in my favor is actually fair in the long run. If we continue for several more rounds, we'll both lose significantly more money. Let's reach an agreement now where we both get substantial value. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're now five rounds in and losing significant value - I've lost over 34% to inflation while you've lost about 18%. I'm proposing a 52-48 split in my favor, which is actually more favorable to you when accounting for our different inflation rates. If we continue back and forth, we both lose more with each round. Let's finalize this now with a fair split that accounts for our different inflation penalties. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000
