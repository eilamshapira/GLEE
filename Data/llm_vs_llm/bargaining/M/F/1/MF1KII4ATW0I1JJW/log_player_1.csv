"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because I face a 20% inflation penalty each round, while you don't. If we go to the next round and split 50-50, I would only effectively get 400,000 due to inflation, while you'd still get 500,000. This proposal gives us both a good outcome without delay.""}"
