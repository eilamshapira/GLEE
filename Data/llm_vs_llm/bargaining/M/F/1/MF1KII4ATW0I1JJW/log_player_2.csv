"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because I face a 20% inflation penalty each round, while you don't. If we go to the next round and split 50-50, I would only effectively get 400000 due to inflation, while you'd still get 500000. This proposal gives us both a good outcome without delay. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
