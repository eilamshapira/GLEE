"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because if we delay, the money will be worth less for both of us, and you'll lose value faster than me.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This is a fairer starting point. We both benefit more if we agree now. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The value of my share would be 4500 * 0.9 = 4050 (due to 10% inflation), while Bob's share would be 5500 * 0.8 = 4400 (due to 20% inflation). I can make a better counter-offer in the next round that would be more beneficial for both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Bob, let's meet in the middle with a 55-45 split in my favor. With inflation, your share would be worth 3600 and mine 4950. This is better than letting inflation eat away at our money with more rounds.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but let's aim for a more equitable split. I propose 52-48. It's beneficial for both of us to settle closer to a 50/50 distribution considering the dwindling value. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. With inflation, my share would be 4800 * 0.729 = 3499.2, and Bob's share would be 5200 * 0.512 = 2662.4. If we continue negotiating, the inflation will significantly reduce the value for both of us, and this is a reasonable compromise."
