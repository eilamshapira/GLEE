Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's meet in the middle with a 55-45 split in my favor. With inflation, your share would be worth 3600 and mine 4950. This is better than letting inflation eat away at our money with more rounds.

# Alice gain: 5500
