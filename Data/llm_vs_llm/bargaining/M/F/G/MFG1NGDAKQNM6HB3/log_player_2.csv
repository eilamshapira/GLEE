"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal: You receive $4826.23 and I keep $5173.77. This split reflects what weâ€™d both expect to obtain if we continued, considering the 20% devaluation per round. Accepting now maximizes our value before the pot shrinks further. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4826.23 
# Alice gain: 5173.77 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
