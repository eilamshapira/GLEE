"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer is $450,000 for me and $550,000 for Alice
2. If I reject, we move to round 2, where:
   * My money will be worth 10% less
   * Alice's money will be worth 20% less
   * I get to make the next proposal

The current offer gives me 45% of the total. While I could try to negotiate for more, the inflation penalty is significant. If I reject:
* My $450,000 would become worth $405,000 next round
* Alice's $550,000 would become worth $440,000 next round

Given the significant inflation penalties and the fact that this is a fairly reasonable first offer, I'll accept.
