"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to avoid the 10% inflation penalty from extending negotiations.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it equally to ensure we both benefit and avoid further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. If I accept Bob's offer now:
   * I get $5000, but with 10% inflation = $4500 effective value
   * Bob gets $5000, with 20% inflation = $4000 effective value

2. If I reject and make a new offer:
   * Next round will have even more inflation (20% for me)
   * I risk getting an even worse deal
   * Bob might reject again

Given that:
- The current split is relatively fair
- Further delays will reduce the value significantly for both of us
- A 50-50 split is a classic fair solution
- I'm actually getting slightly more value than Bob due to different inflation rates
