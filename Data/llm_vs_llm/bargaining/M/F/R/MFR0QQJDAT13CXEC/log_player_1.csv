"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll think strategically here. Given the 20% inflation per round for me, it's in my interest to reach an agreement soon. However, I also want a fair share of the money.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose a slight advantage for me in this first round, giving myself $550,000 and Bob $450,000. This is reasonably fair while acknowledging that I have some leverage as the first mover."
