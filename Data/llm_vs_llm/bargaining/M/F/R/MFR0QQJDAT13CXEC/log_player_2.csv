"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","While the offer is somewhat fair, given the 20% inflation with each round, I need to carefully consider whether I should accept now or make a counter-offer.

If I reject and propose in the next round, the total value will be worth 800,000 to me. Even if I were to get a larger percentage in the next round, I need to factor in this significant reduction.

Alice's current offer gives me 450,000, which is a reasonable 45% of the total sum. If I reject, I would need to secure significantly more than 56.25% of the pot in the next round just to break even (450,000 รท 800,000 = 56.25%).

Given the substantial inflation penalty and the relatively fair initial offer, I'll accept.
