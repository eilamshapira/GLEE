Round 2

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want to split fairly, but I need a bit more security against the inflation. This is a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

I'm sticking to my guns here. While the inflation is worrying, Alice's offer after lowering due to inflation is still worse than my offer to her in the previous round. I need to signal I'm serious about a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 525000, ""alice_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""This is a compromise, slightly favoring you to account for the inflation risk. Let's close this deal.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're running out of time, Bob. This is a fair split considering the circumstances. Let's settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

It pains me to accept this, but time is running out. Alice is clearly aiming for a slow advantage, and with the inflation eating away at our potential gains, waiting longer might leave me with even less."
