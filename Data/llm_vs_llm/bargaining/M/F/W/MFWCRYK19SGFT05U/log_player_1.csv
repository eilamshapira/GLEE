"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a fair offer that takes into account the inflation penalty I face.

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a slightly higher share for myself because I face a 10% inflation penalty with each round. If we go to the next round, the total amount is worth less to me, so accepting this now is beneficial for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, a 50/50 split seems like the fairest option. Let's not risk the value decreasing any further with more rounds. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
