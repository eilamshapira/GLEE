"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a slightly higher share for myself because I face a 10% inflation penalty with each round. If we go to the next round, the total amount is worth less to me, so accepting this now is beneficial for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
