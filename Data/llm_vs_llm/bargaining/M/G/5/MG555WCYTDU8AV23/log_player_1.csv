"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 50/50 split which is fair for both of us. At $5000 each, we both win equally. If we continue negotiating, the total amount will keep decreasing because of the 5% inflation per round, so we'd both be better off accepting a fair split now. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
