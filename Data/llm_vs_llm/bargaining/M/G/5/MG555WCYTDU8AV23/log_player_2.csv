"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if this offer is fair or if I should propose a counter-offer.

Alice is offering me 40% ($4,000) while keeping 60% ($6,000) for herself. If I reject and we move to the next round, the total money decreases by 5% to $9,500. I could then propose a different split, but Alice might also reject my offer, further reducing the total amount.

Given the inflation penalty, accepting a reasonable offer now might be better than risking further devaluation. However, a 50/50 split would be more equitable, and I could propose that in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while acknowledging the time pressure of the inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""I propose a 50/50 split which is fair for both of us. At $5,000 each, we both win equally. If we continue negotiating, the total amount will keep decreasing because of the 5% inflation per round, so we'd both be better off accepting a fair split now.""}"
