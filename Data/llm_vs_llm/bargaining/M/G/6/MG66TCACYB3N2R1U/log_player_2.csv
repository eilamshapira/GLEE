"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair and split it 50/50. What do you say, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 50/50 split, which would give me $50. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but the money will be worth 20% less to me (so $100 would be effectively worth $80). For Alice, the inflation rate is only 5%.

Since the inflation rate affects me much more severely than Alice, delaying the agreement puts me at a disadvantage. If I reject and the negotiation continues for multiple rounds, my potential gain decreases significantly faster than Alice's.

A 50/50 split in the first round is fair and avoids the inflation penalty.
