"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let me make a fair first offer to Bob, suggesting a slightly larger share for me since I'm making the first move.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose a 55-45 split in my favor, which is a reasonable starting point that gives both of us a substantial share while acknowledging my position as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Bob is offering me $49 (worth 5% less due to inflation, so effectively $46.55)
2. If I reject, we move to round 3 with another 5% reduction
3. The split is close to 50-50, which is fair
4. Prolonging negotiations will only reduce the total value further
5. Bob made a reasonable counter-offer that's not too far from my initial proposal

Given these factors, especially considering the inflation penalty, I'll accept this offer.
