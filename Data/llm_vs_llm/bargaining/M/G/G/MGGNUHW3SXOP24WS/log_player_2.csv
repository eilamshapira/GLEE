"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly for a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is affected by 5% inflation per round, while I'm not affected by inflation. If I reject this offer:
- In the next round, I can make an offer
- The money will be worth 5% less to Alice (but same for me)
- This gives me negotiating leverage

A 50-50 split isn't optimal given these circumstances. I can likely get a better deal by rejecting and making a counter-offer that accounts for the inflation penalty Alice faces.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that Alice faces 5% inflation per round and I don't, I can propose a split that's slightly in my favor while still being attractive to Alice, since waiting would cost her more.

If she rejects this offer, in the next round the money will be worth another 5% less to her, so she has incentive to accept a reasonable offer now.
