"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll play as Alice in this game of dividing $1,000,000 with Bob. Let me think this through strategically.

Since I face a higher inflation rate (20% per round) compared to Bob's 5%, it's in my interest to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. However, I still want to make a reasonable offer that Bob would accept.

Given the asymmetric inflation rates, I'll propose a division that's slightly in my favor but still attractive enough for Bob to accept rather than moving to the next round.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because it gives me a reasonable advantage while still offering Bob a substantial amount. Since Bob knows I face higher inflation pressure, this should appear as a fair compromise to avoid further devaluation for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Bob's counteroffer given our different inflation rates.

If I reject Bob's current offer of $450,000 for me and move to round 3, the money would be worth another 20% less to me. This means my $450,000 today is worth more than even a larger amount in the next round.

Specifically, if I get $450,000 now, it's equivalent to getting $562,500 in round 1 terms ($450,000 รท 0.8). If I wait to round 3, any amount would be worth only 64% of its original value to me (0.8 ร 0.8).

Given the steep inflation penalty I face and that Bob offered me a significant portion (45%) of the total, accepting now is the rational choice.
