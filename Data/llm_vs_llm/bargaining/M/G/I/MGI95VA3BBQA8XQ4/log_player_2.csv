"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $450,000 and she gets $550,000 of the $1,000,000 total.

I need to consider the inflation factors. If I reject this offer:
- Next round, the money will be worth 5% less to me
- For Alice, the money will be worth 20% less

If I make a counter-offer in the next round, Alice would need to consider that her money would be worth significantly less (80% of original value). This gives me negotiating leverage.

Even though Alice's current offer gives me a decent amount, I believe I can propose a more favorable split in the next round, given Alice's higher inflation penalty.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given the inflation factors, I'll make a strategic offer. Since the money is worth 20% less to Alice this round while only 5% less to me, I have an advantage in negotiation.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing that I receive $550,000 and Alice receives $450,000. This is fair considering our different inflation rates. If Alice rejects this offer, she'll face 20% more inflation in the next round, while I'll only face 5% more inflation, putting her at a greater disadvantage. It's in both our interests to reach an agreement now rather than continuing to later rounds where the total value diminishes for both of us."
