"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split while accounting for the risk of inflation affecting future rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable split that gives both of us a good portion, while slightly favoring me as the first mover. If Bob rejects, we'll both lose value due to inflation in the next round."
