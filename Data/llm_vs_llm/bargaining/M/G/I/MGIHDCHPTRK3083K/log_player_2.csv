"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer carefully, taking into account the inflation penalty for delaying.

If I reject now, I'll make an offer next round, but the money will be worth 5% less to me. I need to decide if I can get enough more than $45 to justify that loss.

Given that:
1. Alice has offered me a reasonable $45 (almost 50-50 split)
2. Inflation will reduce the value by 5% each round
3. There's uncertainty about how inflation affects Alice
4. We have limited rounds before we both get nothing

I'll accept this offer. It's a fair starting point, and the risk of prolonged negotiation with inflation doesn't seem worthwhile.
