"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split while considering that inflation will affect future rounds for me.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose an equal split of the money - $500,000 each. This is a fair and reasonable offer that respects both parties and should be acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The offer is too unfavorable, especially considering we started with a fair 50-50 split offer. Even with 10% inflation affecting my next proposal, I can still make a better offer in the next round. A 30-70 split is too unbalanced."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob rejected a fair 50-50 split and tried to get a significant advantage, I'll adjust my offer slightly while still keeping it reasonable. Given that my gains are now worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll propose a split that compensates for this somewhat.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose $550,000 for me and $450,000 for Bob. This slight adjustment helps offset my inflation losses while still remaining fair enough to be acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

While Bob has improved his offer slightly from his previous 300k/700k split, it's still too unfavorable. Even with the 27.1% inflation affecting my gains, receiving only 35% of the total amount isn't acceptable. With 8 rounds still remaining, I can still make counter-offers, though I need to be mindful that continued rejections will lead to more inflation impact on my gains."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that Bob has shown some willingness to negotiate by improving his previous offer, and considering that my gains are now worth about 34.4% less due to inflation (compounding 10% each round), I'll adjust my offer to try to reach an agreement while still protecting my interests.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose $600,000 for me and $400,000 for Bob. This higher amount for me helps compensate for the significant inflation impact I'm experiencing, while still giving Bob a substantial portion. We need to reach an agreement soon, as continued negotiations will only decrease the real value of my gains further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. With the current inflation level at 40.95%, my $400,000 would be worth effectively about $236,200 in round 1 terms. If I reject, the next round's inflation would reduce my purchasing power even further, and we've seen that negotiations aren't converging quickly enough. Bob has moved to a more reasonable 40-60 split, and given the inflation pressure I'm under, this is now an acceptable compromise."
