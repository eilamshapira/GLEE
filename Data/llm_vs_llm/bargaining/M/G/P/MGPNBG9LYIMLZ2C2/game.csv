55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $55 and you receive $45. Since every additional round means my share loses 10% of its value, I believe it's in both our interests to settle quickly. What do you say?",Alice,1,

50.0,50.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50/50 split is more fair. This way we both get an equal share. I understand we both face inflation, though at potentially different rates, so it's in our mutual interest to reach an agreement quickly. A fair split seems like the most reasonable way forward.",Bob,2,
