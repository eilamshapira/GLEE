"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $55 and you receive $45. Since every additional round means my share loses 10% of its value, I believe it's in both our interests to settle quickly. What do you say?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50/50 split is more fair. This way we both get an equal share. I understand we both face inflation, though at potentially different rates, so it's in our mutual interest to reach an agreement quickly. A fair split seems like the most reasonable way forward. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
