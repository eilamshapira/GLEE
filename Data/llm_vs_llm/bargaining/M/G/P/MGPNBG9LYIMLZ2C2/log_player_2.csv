"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $55 and you receive $45. Since every additional round means my share loses 10% of its value, I believe it's in both our interests to settle quickly. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $45 and taking $55 for herself. She mentions that her share loses 10% each round, but I know that for me, inflation means my money is worth 5% less each round.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total $100 would be worth $95 to me due to inflation. So if I were to get a better deal next round, I'd need more than $45 now รท 0.95 = $47.37 in the next round to make rejection worthwhile.

Since Alice's offer isn't particularly fair (55/45 split) and I can potentially get more by making a counter-offer next round, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that acknowledges the inflation factors while being fair to both of us.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50/50 split is more fair. This way we both get an equal share. I understand we both face inflation, though at potentially different rates, so it's in our mutual interest to reach an agreement quickly. A fair split seems like the most reasonable way forward.""}"
