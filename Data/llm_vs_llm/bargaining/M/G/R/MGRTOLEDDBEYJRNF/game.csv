50.0,50.0,I think an equal 50-50 split is the fairest way to divide the money. This way we both benefit equally from the arrangement.,Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"Okay, let's try this again. I'm giving you slightly more this time, so we can finalize this and both walk away with something good.",Alice,3,

45.0,55.0,"I notice you're affected by inflation while I'm not. Since the value of money is decreasing for you each round, it makes sense to reach an agreement soon. I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, which I think is fair considering our different positions. Let's finalize this deal now so you don't lose more value to inflation.",Bob,4,
