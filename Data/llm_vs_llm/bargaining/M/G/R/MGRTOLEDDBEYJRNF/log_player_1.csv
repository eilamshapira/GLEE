# Bob's message: I notice you're affected by inflation while I'm not. Since the value of money is decreasing for you each round, it makes sense to reach an agreement soon. I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, which I think is fair considering our different positions. Let's finalize this deal now so you don't lose more value to inflation.

# Bob gain: 55
