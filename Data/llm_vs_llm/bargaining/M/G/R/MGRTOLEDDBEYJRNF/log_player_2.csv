"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering a generous split to start. Let's keep it friendly and take the deal! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's offering me $40 out of the $100 total, while she would take $60. This is less than an equal split, but not dramatically unfair.

Since there's no inflation for me (the money is worth 0% less with each round), I don't lose value by rejecting and making a counter-offer. I could potentially get a better deal in the next round.

I'll reject this offer so I can propose a more favorable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more even split while being reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""I think an equal 50-50 split is the fairest way to divide the money. This way we both benefit equally from the arrangement.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's try this again. I'm giving you slightly more this time, so we can finalize this and both walk away with something good. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this updated offer from Alice. She's now offering me $45 out of the $100, which is better than her initial offer of $40, but still less than the equal split I proposed.

I notice that Alice is experiencing inflation (her money is worth 19% less than in the first round), but I'm not affected by inflation. This gives me a slight advantage in negotiation as time passes.

Given that:
1. Alice's offer has improved
2. Alice is facing inflation pressure
3. I could potentially get an even better deal in the next round

I'll reject this offer and make another proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I notice you're affected by inflation while I'm not. Since the value of money is decreasing for you each round, it makes sense to reach an agreement soon. I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, which I think is fair considering our different positions. Let's finalize this deal now so you don't lose more value to inflation.""}"
