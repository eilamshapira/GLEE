"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, considering I'm making the first offer and taking the initiative.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the initiative you took and the inflation, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Bob's offered me $45, which hasn't lost any value for me
2. Bob would get $55, but with 5% inflation, it's effectively worth $52.25 to him
3. If I reject, we go to another round, but inflation will continue affecting Bob's gains
4. This is actually a reasonable offer given the circumstances
