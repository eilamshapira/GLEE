"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: I get $40, Alice gets $60
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, my next round gains would be worth 5% less
4. If I reject, $40 in the next round would only be worth $38 to me
5. I might be able to negotiate a better split, but the inflation risk makes this offer reasonably fair

I think I'll accept this offer. While it's not a 50-50 split, getting $40 now is better than risking getting less value in future rounds due to inflation.
