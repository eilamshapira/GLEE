"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Let me think through this. In this game, we need to divide $100 between Bob and myself. I'll make the first offer, and then Bob can either accept or make a counter-offer in the next round. The money doesn't lose value for me across rounds, but I don't know if Bob faces inflation.

Since I'm going first, I should propose a fair division that Bob would likely accept, while also trying to maximize my gain. A 50-50 split is traditionally seen as fair, but I could try for a bit more.

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""I propose a slightly favorable split for me at 55-45. It's fair and allows us to conclude the negotiation quickly without risking further rounds.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I propose a 52-48 split in my favor. This ensures both of us get a fair share while accounting for the decreasing value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Bob's offer carefully.

Bob has offered me $48 out of the $100, while taking $52 for himself. He mentions inflation, which affects his gains but not mine (according to the rules). 

If I reject this offer, we'll go to round 3 where I can make another proposal. However, Bob will face even more inflation in the next round (likely another 5% decrease in value). This gives me some leverage.

I could reject and offer something more favorable to me in the next round. However, Bob's current offer is fairly reasonable - I get 48% of the pot, which isn't far from an even split.

Given that:
1. The offer is relatively fair
2. Continuing negotiation carries some risk
3. I don't know exactly how Bob values future rounds

I'll accept this offer.
