"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a division that considers both our interests, recognizing that Bob's money loses value each round while mine doesn't.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I suggest you get $40 and I get $60. This is a fair offer considering you'll lose 5% value each round if you reject, while I don't face any inflation pressure."
