"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make my first offer to divide the $100.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose we split the money almost evenly, with me getting $55 and you getting $45. I think this is fair given that the money decreases in value for me each round, so there's an incentive for both of us to reach an agreement quickly."
