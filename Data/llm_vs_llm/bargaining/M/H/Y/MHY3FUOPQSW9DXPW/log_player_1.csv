"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 525000,
""bob_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair, Bob. This split accounts for the money losing value over time.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Fairness:** I'm starting with a slightly advantageous offer to myself, recognizing that the money will be worth less if Bob rejects and I have to propose again in a future round. 
* **Transparency:**  By explaining my logic to Bob, I'm hoping to establish a sense of transparency and encourage a quick agreement. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the situation with inflation, Alice. How about this slightly adjusted offer? 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation.  He understands inflation is impacting me, but his offer barely budges in my favor. It's better to make a counter-offer and see if I can get a more agreeable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 545000,
""bob_gain"": 455000,
""message"": ""Bob, I need you to meet me closer to the middle on this. Time is literally money for me in this deal!"" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Share:** I'm increasing my share slightly from my initial offer, reflecting the increasing impact of inflation with each passing round.
* **Sense of Urgency:** I'm reiterating the time pressure to Bob, hoping he'll see the value in a quicker agreement. 

Let's hope Bob is willing to negotiate fairly this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this offer is a good compromise considering the time pressure. Let's close the deal! 
# Alice gain: 535000 
# Bob gain: 465000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, this offer is better than what I could likely secure in another round, considering the inflation and Bob's stubbornness.  The longer this goes on, the more I lose. It's time to cut my losses and accept."
