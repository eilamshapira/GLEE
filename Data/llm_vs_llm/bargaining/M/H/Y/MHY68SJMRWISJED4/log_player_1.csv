"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to make a proposal to maximize my gain while considering the decreasing value of the money over time. I will propose a split that favors me significantly, but hopefully, Bob will still find it acceptable rather than risk further devaluation.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 572500 
# Bob gain: 427500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this.

*   **My perspective:** Accepting this offer gives me $572,500. Since this is round 2, the money's worth has decreased by 10%, so this is equivalent to $572,500 * 0.9 = $515,250 in round 1 dollars.

*   **Alternative: Rejecting and making my own offer in round 3.** If I reject, in round 3 the money will be worth 20% less to me (10% * 2). I need to consider what offer I could realistically make in round 3 that would give me more than $515,250 (in round 1 dollars), while also being acceptable to Bob, whose money would have decreased by 10%. Given that Bob rejected my initial offer of 90/10 split, making a favorable offer in round 3 might be difficult.

Given the risk of further devaluation and the uncertainty of crafting an acceptable offer in round 3 that would net me significantly more, I will accept Bob's offer.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
