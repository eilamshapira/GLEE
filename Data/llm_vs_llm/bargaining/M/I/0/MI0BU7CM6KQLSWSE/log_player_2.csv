"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is proposing I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000
2. This is a 40-60 split, not exactly equal
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
4. There's no inflation penalty for me, so waiting isn't costly
5. I could potentially get a better deal by making a counter-offer

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the offer now:

{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I propose a more balanced 55-45 split, which is fairer than the previous offer.""
}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle, slightly in my favor 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:
1. Alice is now offering me $4,200 (up from $4,000 in her first offer)
2. She's asking for $5,800 (down from $6,000)
3. I know her money is worth 36% less due to inflation
4. My money value hasn't changed
5. Her $5,800 is actually worth only $3,712 to her after inflation
6. She's showing willingness to compromise
7. If I reject, the inflation will get worse for her in the next round

Since the inflation is significantly affecting Alice's gains and she's made a compromise, I should accept this offer. Further negotiation might make both of us worse off.
