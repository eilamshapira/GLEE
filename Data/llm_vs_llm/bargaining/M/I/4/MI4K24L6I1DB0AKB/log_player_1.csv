"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split with a slight advantage for me as the first mover.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}

I propose this split because it's close to equal while giving me a small first-mover advantage. It's fair enough that Bob should accept it rather than risk the 5% inflation loss by going to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Bob's offer gives me $4900, which due to 5% inflation is actually worth $4655
2. If I reject, we move to round 3 with another 5% inflation
3. Even if I make a better offer next round, Bob might reject again
4. The difference between our shares in Bob's proposal is relatively small
5. Getting $4655 now is better than risking further inflation or potential deadlock
