"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I need to consider the actual value. The original $4500 is now worth $4500 * 0.95 = $4275.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is not in my favor.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 10% less than the original value (5% less in each of the two rounds), and the money Bob gains is worth 19% less (10% less in each of the two rounds).

To calculate the actual values:
My gain: $x * 0.95 * 0.95 = $x * 0.9025
Bob's gain: $y * 0.9 * 0.9 = $y * 0.81

I'll make an offer that takes this into account.

{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 14.26% less, I need to consider the actual value. The original $5000 is now worth $5000 * 0.8574 = $4287.

Considering this, an equal split of the original amount is not equal in value due to inflation. However, it's still a significant amount, and I should weigh it against the risk of further inflation in the next rounds.
