"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your call for fairness. However, with each round my share loses 10% of its value, and I’d really prefer to settle before that hurt both of us. I’m proposing a 50/50 division—let’s lock this in quickly and avoid any further devaluation. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
