Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your call for fairness. However, with each round my share loses 10% of its value, and I’d really prefer to settle before that hurt both of us. I’m proposing a 50/50 division—let’s lock this in quickly and avoid any further devaluation. What do you say?""}"
