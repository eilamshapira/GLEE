"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a reasonable offer that acknowledges both our interests, considering that inflation will affect my gains in future rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

This is a fair split offering Bob a substantial portion while giving me a slight advantage as the first mover. Let's see if Bob accepts this reasonable proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept now, I'll get $450,000 but it's worth 5% less, so effectively $427,500
2. If I reject, I can make another offer, but my next potential gains will be worth another 5% less
3. Bob seems to be playing a tit-for-tat strategy, just flipping my original offer
4. There's a risk of getting nothing if we can't agree in 12 rounds
5. This is still a reasonable offer, and the inflation penalty will only get worse

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While it's slightly less favorable than my initial proposal, the inflation effect makes it better to accept now than to risk further devaluation of my share in future rounds."
