"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's offering me $10,000 while keeping $990,000 for herself, which is a very uneven split. If I reject, I can make my own offer next round, but I should remember that inflation will reduce the value of my share by 5% per round. Let me evaluate my options.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer while accounting for the inflation factor. Since I'll lose 5% of value each round, I should propose a fair division that Alice would reasonably accept.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing an even 50-50 split of the money. This is fair to both of us, and since Alice doesn't face any inflation penalty, accepting this balanced offer now would be rational rather than continuing to future rounds where the total value I receive would decrease."
