"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but considering the rapid decrease in value for me, I think 58-42 is a more balanced proposal this round. Let's see if we can settle this soon. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is still trying to take a large portion despite the inflation working heavily in my favor.  I need to push for a more equitable split."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 48,
""alice_gain"": 52,

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see your point about finding a compromise. Given the significant inflation impact on my side, I propose 55-45 this round. Let's try to end this soon before the value drops further. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is the same offer Alice gave in Round 2, but due to inflation, it's now more favorable to me and less favorable to her. It's time to accept and lock in a reasonable share."
