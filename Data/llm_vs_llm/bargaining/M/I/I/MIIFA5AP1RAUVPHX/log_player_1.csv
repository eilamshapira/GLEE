"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I suggest a fair 60-40 split. With higher inflation affecting me more, this accounts for the future value loss if we delay.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, considering that delaying affects both our shares negatively. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept now, I get $50, but it's worth 20% less due to inflation, so effectively $40
2. If I reject, we go to next round where:
   - I can propose again
   - But any amount will be worth 40% less for me
   - And only 10% less for Bob
   - Making it harder to get a good deal

Given these conditions, accepting $50 now (worth $40 after inflation) is better than risking another round where my negotiating position would be even weaker due to the asymmetric inflation rates.
