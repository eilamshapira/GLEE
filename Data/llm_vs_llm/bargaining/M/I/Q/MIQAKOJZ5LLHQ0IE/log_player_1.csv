"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. Here's my offer for Round 1, considering the inflation effect on my side:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

My reasoning: I'm starting with a proposal that gives me a slightly larger share, acknowledging the potential for future inflation impacting my gains. I believe this is a reasonable starting point that Bob might accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob's offer is a 50/50 split. Given that I am facing inflation, and Bob isn't (at least I am assuming that), this is a relatively fair offer. The money I would gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
