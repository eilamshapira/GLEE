"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your fair offer. Since there's no inflation effect for me, I'd like to propose a slight adjustment in my favor. You get $450000 and I get $550000. This is still a very substantial amount for both of us, and we can avoid the risk of multiple rounds of negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
