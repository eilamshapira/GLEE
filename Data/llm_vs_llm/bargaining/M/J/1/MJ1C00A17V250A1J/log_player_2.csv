"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, 50-50. What do you say, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice's offer of a 50-50 split seems fair on the surface, I should consider my strategic position. Since there's no inflation for me but possible inflation for Alice, I might gain leverage in later rounds. However, $500,000 is still a substantial amount, and there's risk in rejecting a fair offer if negotiations break down.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a slightly better offer for myself while still being reasonably fair.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your fair offer. Since there's no inflation effect for me, I'd like to propose a slight adjustment in my favor. You get $450,000 and I get $550,000. This is still a very substantial amount for both of us, and we can avoid the risk of multiple rounds of negotiation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering the inflation effect on my side, I think a 475000 to 525000 split is fair. It's a middle ground between our last offers. Let's settle this and move on. 
# Bob gain: 525000 
# Alice gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice has offered me $525,000, which is more than the 50-50 split from her first offer, but less than what I asked for in the previous round. She's also mentioned that she's experiencing inflation effects, which explains why she's willing to give me more than half. This is a reasonable compromise between our positions.
