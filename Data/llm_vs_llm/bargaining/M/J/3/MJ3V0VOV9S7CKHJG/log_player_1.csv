"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a reasonable but slightly advantageous offer for myself, considering that inflation will reduce the value in future rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose taking $5,500 for myself and giving $4,500 to Bob. This is a fair offer that gives me a slight advantage but should be acceptable to Bob, as it's close to an even split. If Bob rejects, the next round's money will be worth 20% less to me, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that due to inflation my $4,000 would actually be worth only $3,200 (80% of original value), and if I reject, the next round will be worth even less (only 64% of original value), this isn't a great offer. However, I need to consider that further delays will only decrease the value more significantly for me.

Still, I believe I can get a better deal by making another offer in the next round, even with the inflation penalty, as this split is too unfavorable.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that money is now worth 60% of its original value for me (after two rounds of 20% inflation), I need to aim for a higher nominal amount to compensate. However, I also need to make it attractive enough for Bob to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose taking $6,000 for myself and giving $4,000 to Bob. Due to inflation, my $6,000 is actually worth only $3,600 to me (60% of $6,000), which is less than what a 50-50 split would have been worth in round 1. This offer still gives Bob a decent amount, and we should try to reach an agreement soon before further inflation erodes the value even more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- With 48.8% inflation, my $4,200 would actually be worth $2,150.40 (51.2% of $4,200)
- If I reject and we go to next round, any amount will be worth only about 41% of its original value
- Bob's offer is slightly better than his previous one ($4,200 vs $4,000)
- We're already in round 4 of 12, and the value keeps decreasing significantly

While this isn't an ideal split, the inflation is severely impacting my potential gains, and waiting longer will only make it worse. I should accept this offer now rather than risk getting even less value in future rounds.
