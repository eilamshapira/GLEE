"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the situation.

In Round 2, my money is worth 20% less than in Round 1. This means that $100 in Round 1 is equivalent to $80 for me in Round 2. Similarly, Bob's money is worth 5% less, so $100 in Round 1 is equivalent to $95 for Bob in Round 2.

Bob's offer is: Alice gets $40, Bob gets $60.

Since my money is worth less due to inflation, I need to consider the relative value of the offer.

Let's calculate the *real* value of the offer:

*   **Alice's Perspective:** $40 in Round 2 has the same purchasing power as $40 / 0.80 = $50 in Round 1.

While my offer was for a bigger share for myself, the real value of Bob's offer is bigger than the 10$ I proposed to give him.

Therefore, I will accept.
