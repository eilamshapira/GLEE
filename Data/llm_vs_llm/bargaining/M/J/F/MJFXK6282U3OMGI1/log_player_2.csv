"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll propose a more balanced split in the next round since 10$ is too low for me. Even with potential inflation, I can aim for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which is reasonable considering I have more to lose with inflation in future rounds."
