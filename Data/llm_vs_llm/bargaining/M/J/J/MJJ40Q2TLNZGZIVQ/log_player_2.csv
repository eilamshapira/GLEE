"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer or make a counter-proposal in the next round.

Alice is offering me $400,000 (40%) while taking $600,000 (60%) for herself. This isn't an equal split, and we have plenty of rounds remaining to negotiate.

I'll reject this initial offer and make my own proposal in the next round.
