"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think an even 50-50 split would be fairest for both of us. I'm proposing we each get $5000. This is a balanced offer that gives us both equal value. Let's agree and avoid losing money to inflation in further rounds. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
