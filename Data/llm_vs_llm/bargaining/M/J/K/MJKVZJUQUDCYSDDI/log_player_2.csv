"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair division. My offer is $6000 for me and $4000 for you. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. Alice is proposing that she gets $6000 and I get $4000. This isn't an even split, but I need to consider that if I reject, we move to the next round where I can make a counter-offer, but the total amount will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation.

If I reject, the $10,000 will be worth $9,500 to me in the next round. I could propose a more favorable split then, but Alice might reject that too.

Given that we have 12 rounds total and each rejection costs me 5% in value, I should carefully consider whether to accept now or negotiate for more.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that considers the inflation effect while trying to reach a fair agreement.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I think an even 50-50 split would be fairest for both of us. I'm proposing we each get $5000. This is a balanced offer that gives us both equal value. Let's agree and avoid losing money to inflation in further rounds.""}"
