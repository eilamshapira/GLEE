"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this carefully. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100, while taking $60 for herself. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation, meaning the $100 pot would effectively be worth only $80 to me.

If I reject now, I could propose a better split for myself in the next round, but I'd be working with a smaller effective total due to inflation. Even if I proposed a 50/50 split next round, I'd get $50 of money that's worth only 80% of its original value to me, which is equivalent to $40 in current value.
