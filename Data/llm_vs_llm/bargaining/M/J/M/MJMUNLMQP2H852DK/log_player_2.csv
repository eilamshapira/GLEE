"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's split it 60/40. This is a fair offer, and it gives you a significant portion to start with. Let's avoid further rounds and potential inflation.

Do you accept this offer?","```json

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can do better. This is my counteroffer, with me taking slightly more this time. Let's avoid further rounds and potential losses from inflation.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want more, but I'm accounting for the inflation we've both experienced. Let's meet in the middle with a 55/45 split. This is a fair compromise, considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
