"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

This is the first round, so there's no inflation effect yet. 
Alice is offering me $400,000 out of $1,000,000 (40% of the total).

If I reject:
- I can make a counter-offer next round
- But the money will be worth 20% less to me
- $1,000,000 will effectively be worth $800,000 for me in round 2

$400,000 now is better than a maximum of $800,000 in the next round (which I might not even get if Alice rejects).

While Alice's offer isn't perfectly equal, it's a reasonable first offer and the inflation penalty makes it risky to reject.
