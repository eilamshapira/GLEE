"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for round 1. I'll propose a slightly favorable split for myself, recognizing the potential for negotiation later, but also wanting to secure a good initial offer.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I'll consider Bob's offer. My initial offer was 6000, but the inflation is a serious factor. My 6000 from round 1 is now equivalent to 4800 in this round's money (6000 * 0.8). Bob is offering 5000. While it's not as good as my initial ask *before* inflation, it's a better deal than what my initial ask is currently worth. So I'll accept.
