"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, considering the inflation and Bob's offer:

Before inflation, my gains would have been worth 45$. Because the money is worth 10% less each round, the original 45$ I would have gotten is worth 90% of the previous value: 45$ * 0.9 = 40.5$.

Since the offer is better than nothing, and I still get a significant portion, I will accept.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
