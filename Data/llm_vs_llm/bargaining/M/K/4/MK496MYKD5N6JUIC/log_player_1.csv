"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, given the inflation dynamics, waiting further only hurts your share significantly. By accepting this division, you secure what you would otherwise get in the next round. I’m offering you 166667, which reflects your discounted value if you wait. Let’s settle now and avoid further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 166667 
# Bob gain: 833333 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
