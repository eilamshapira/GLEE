"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. This is a fair 50-50 split
2. Due to inflation, if I wait one round:
   * The $50 would be worth 40$ (20% less) to me
   * I don't know how inflation affects Alice
3. This is the first round, so I have bargaining power
4. However, a 50-50 split is generally considered fair

Given that inflation will reduce my value in future rounds and this is a fair offer, I'll accept.
