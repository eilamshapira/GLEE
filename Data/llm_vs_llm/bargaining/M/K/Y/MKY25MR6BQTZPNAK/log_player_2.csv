"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
* She's offering me $40 out of $100
* If I reject, we move to next round but money loses 20% value
* Next round total would be worth $80, and I'd get to make the offer
* I could potentially get more by negotiating, but there's risk of further value loss

I think I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round, even with the 20% loss.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a more balanced offer, considering the 20% value loss that has already occurred:

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I propose an equal split because:
1. It's fair and reasonable
2. With the 20% value loss, we're actually dividing $80 now
3. If Alice rejects, we'll lose another 20% in the next round
4. An equal split gives Alice less reason to reject and continue negotiating"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze Alice's new offer:
* She's offering me $45 out of $100, but with 36% inflation
* Real value of my share would be $45 * 0.64 = $28.80
* If I reject, next round will have 56% total inflation
* She's moved from her initial 40/60 split to a 45/55 split, showing willingness to negotiate
* Further negotiation might lead to diminishing returns due to increasing inflation

Given that Alice has improved her offer and the significant inflation penalty for continuing, I'll accept this offer.
