Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hey Bob! Let's both come out ahead with this fair offer. I'll take $60, and you take $40. Let's agree to finish the game and enjoy our gains right now!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor. Let's be reasonable. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  Think it over - it's better to secure a deal now than risk further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
