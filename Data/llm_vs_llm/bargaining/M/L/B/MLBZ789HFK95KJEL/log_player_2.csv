"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the effective amount is $80 for me, but still $100 for Alice. To make a fair offer, I'll consider this.

{""bob_gain"": 40, 
""alice_gain"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept $35 now, its value is 64% of the original $35 (since it's worth 36% less), which is approximately $22.40 in the original value.

However, I should compare this to what I might get in the next round. If I reject this offer, the money will be worth even less to me in the next round.
