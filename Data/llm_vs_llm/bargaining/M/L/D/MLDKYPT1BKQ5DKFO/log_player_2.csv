"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully given the inflation effect. If I reject, in the next round the $100 will be worth only $80 to me, and my counter-offer would be made on that reduced amount.

Let me evaluate: Alice is offering me $40 out of $100. If I reject, I could propose a split of the $80 value (after 20% inflation), but I'd need to offer Alice enough to make her accept.

Given the declining value and limited rounds, securing $40 now is reasonable rather than risking further devaluation.
