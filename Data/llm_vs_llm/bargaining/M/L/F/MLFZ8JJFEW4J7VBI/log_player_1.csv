Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5128, ""bob_gain"": 4872, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing an immediate and fair division based on our discounting: $5128 for me and $4872 for you. Let’s avoid future loss in value—please accept this offer!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, in light of the devaluation and to reach an efficient agreement, I'm proposing a split that reflects the discounted value. I suggest $5128 for me and $4872 for you in this round, which is consistent with our discounted bargaining values. Accepting now avoids further losses in value for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4872 
# Bob gain: 5128
