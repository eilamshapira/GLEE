I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, as I am the one initiating the offer.  Let's see if Bob agrees or wants to counter-propose."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to try a 60/40 split in my favor.  While Bob rejected my initial 90/10 offer, I'm hoping this is more palatable and avoids another round of negotiation.  Let's see what he says!"
