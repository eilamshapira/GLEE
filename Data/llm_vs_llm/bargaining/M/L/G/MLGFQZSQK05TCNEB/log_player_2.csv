"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a counter-offer in the next round. 90-10 split in Alice's favor is too uneven, especially when there's so much money at stake."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose a fair 50-50 split. This way we both get an equal share of $500,000, which is much better than the previous 90-10 split. Even with the 10% inflation from the first round, we'll both still get $450,000 each, which is significantly better than what I was offered before."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. It's a reasonable 40-60 split, and with the 19% inflation already affecting the money's value, further delays would only reduce our gains more. My share of $400,000 (worth about $324,000 after inflation) is much better than the initial $100,000 offer, and continuing to negotiate would risk losing more value to inflation."
