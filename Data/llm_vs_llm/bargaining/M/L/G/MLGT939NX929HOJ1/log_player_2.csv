"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's agree on this fair split. I'm proposing 550k for me and 450k for you. Deal? 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each round, I'll make a more favorable offer to myself to compensate for the potential loss.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""My turn! Considering the inflation, I'm making a more reasonable offer. Let's settle this.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, round 3. Inflation is hurting us both. I'll take slightly more due to my inflation hit, but still leaving you a good chunk. Let's do 620k for me, 380k for you. Accept this, Bob! 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain is worth 36% less, which means the $380,000 is actually worth around $243,200 to me. On the other hand, Alice's offer seems to be taking into account her own inflation hit, but it's still not very favorable to me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth even less to me now (36% less in round 3, and another 20% less in this round, making it approximately 51.2% less than the original value), I'll make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal.

{""bob_gain"": 650000, 
""alice_gain"": 350000, 
""message"": ""Inflation is killing me! I need a better split to make up for the loss. This is my final reasonable offer.""}"
