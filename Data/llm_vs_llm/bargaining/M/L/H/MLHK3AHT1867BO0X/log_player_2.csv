"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split, let's be reasonable 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $400,000 while she gets $600,000. This is a 40-60 split in her favor. 

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation. That means the total effective value to me would be $900,000 in the next round. If I were to then propose a 50-50 split, I'd get $450,000, which is better than the current $400,000 offer.

However, Alice might reject my counter-offer, and we'd continue losing value. The risk of ongoing rejections could leave us both with nothing.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split that acknowledges the time pressure we both face.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. This is equitable for both of us and allows us to avoid losing more value to inflation. Let's resolve this efficiently.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, 58-42 is more than fair now 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to analyze this situation carefully. Alice rejected my 50-50 split and is now offering me 42% ($420,000).

Due to inflation affecting me, the money is now worth 19% less to me than in round 1. This means if I reject this offer, in the next round the total value to me would be worth even less.

Alice has increased her offer from $400,000 to $420,000, which is a modest improvement. However, given the inflation pressure that's only affecting me, my negotiating position weakens with each round.

If I reject, I could make another counter-offer, but Alice seems resistant to equal splits, and further delays will cost me more through inflation.
