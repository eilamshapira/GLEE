"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split, considering that I (Alice) face higher inflation pressure, so we should try to resolve this quickly.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is slightly in my favor but still fair, considering I face higher inflation (20% per round) compared to Bob's 5% per round."
