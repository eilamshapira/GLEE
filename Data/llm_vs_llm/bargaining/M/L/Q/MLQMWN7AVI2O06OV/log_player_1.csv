"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, to avoid the risk of any unknown inflation affecting our future value and to secure our gains now, I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. I believe this offer balances our interests and respects the need to act swiftly. Let's close this deal before any potential devaluation occurs. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
