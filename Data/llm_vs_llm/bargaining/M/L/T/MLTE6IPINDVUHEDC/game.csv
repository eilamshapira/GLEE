600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we split the money with me taking 60% and you taking 40%. This way, we both get a significant amount, and we can end the game early to avoid inflation affecting our shares too much.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Alice, I believe a 50-50 split is fair given the rapid decrease in value for both of us. Let's end this quickly and share equally before inflation impacts us further.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I understand your point about a fair split, but considering the higher inflation rate on my side, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This way, we can still end the game soon and both walk away with a good amount before the value drops further.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
525000.0,475000.0,"Alice, I see your point about the higher inflation rate affecting you more. However, I believe a 47.5-52.5 split is a fair compromise. This way, you still get more than half, but I also get a bit more to account for the inflation on my side. Let's end this now before our shares lose more value.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
525000.0,475000.0,"Bob, I see your compromise, but given the significant impact of inflation on my side, I propose we stick with a 52.5-47.5 split. This way, we can end the game now and both benefit before the value decreases further. Let's agree on this and conclude the game.",Alice,5,
