Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see your point about the higher inflation rate affecting you more. However, I believe a 47.5-52.5 split is a fair compromise. This way, you still get more than half, but I also get a bit more to account for the inflation on my side. Let's end this now before our shares lose more value.
