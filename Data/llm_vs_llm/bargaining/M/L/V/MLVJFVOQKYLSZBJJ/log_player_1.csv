Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose an equal 50-50 split. This is fair for both of us, and considering the inflation rates, we both benefit from agreeing now rather than prolonging negotiations. Let's settle this fairly and both walk away with significant value. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
