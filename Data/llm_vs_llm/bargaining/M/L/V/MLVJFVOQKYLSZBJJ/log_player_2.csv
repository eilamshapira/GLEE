"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a generous offer for you. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's proposal gives me $100,000 out of the $1,000,000, which is only 10% of the total amount. If I reject this offer, the total value will decrease by 20% for me in the next round, but I'll have the opportunity to make a counter-proposal.

The current value to me is $100,000, but if I reject, the total pot's value to me becomes $800,000 (after 20% inflation), and I can propose a more favorable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I need to make a strategic offer that accounts for the different inflation rates that affect Alice and me. Since I'm experiencing 20% inflation per round and Alice only 10%, I should propose a fair division that gives us both incentive to agree now rather than continuing.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""I propose an equal 50-50 split. This is fair for both of us, and considering the inflation rates, we both benefit from agreeing now rather than prolonging negotiations. Let's settle this fairly and both walk away with significant value.""}"
