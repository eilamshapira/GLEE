"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I should make a reasonable first offer that accounts for the different inflation rates affecting Alice (me) and Bob. Since my money loses value faster (20% per round vs Bob's 5%), I should aim for a larger share but not be too greedy to avoid multiple rounds of negotiation.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this 60-40 split because:
1. It gives Bob a substantial portion while accounting for my higher inflation rate
2. It's a reasonable starting point that leaves room for negotiation if needed
3. It's not so extreme that it would likely be rejected outright"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Due to inflation in round 2:
- My $5000 is worth 20% less = $4000 effective value
- Bob's $5000 is worth 5% less = $4750 effective value

2. If I reject and we go to round 3:
- Values will decrease further (my share by another 20%, Bob's by 5%)
- There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal
- The risk of further devaluation is significant

3. A 50-50 split is generally fair, but due to different inflation rates, it actually favors Bob significantly.

However, if I reject, my negotiating position will be even weaker in the next round due to the asymmetric inflation rates. The risk of getting an even worse deal outweighs the potential benefit of continuing.
