Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want more, but you should consider the inflation affecting you. If we keep going, your share becomes worth less each round. This 55-45 split is fair considering that delay hurts you more than me. Let's agree now and avoid further devaluation of your share.

# Alice gain: 55
