"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 100, ""bob_gain"": 0, ""message"": ""Bob, since every round you wait cuts your money’s value by 20%, your best alternative is essentially nothing. I’m proposing the full $100 for me—accepting now is your only way to get any value, and even then it’s nothing. Choose to agree now and end this quickly.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know the value of money decreases for me with each round, but I'm not willing to give up everything. This offer is more reasonable, and we both get something. Accepting now will benefit both of us. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate that you want to share the pie, the fact is that my money doesn't depreciate while yours does. With your proposal offering me $40 now, I believe there's room for a more favorable division—especially since if we proceed, I'll have the next move without any depreciation penalty. I'm therefore rejecting this offer, and I invite you to consider a proposal that reflects the timing advantages at play.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Bob, consider this: if you reject, you’ll be forced to propose in the next round—where your money suffers even more depreciation, leaving you with effectively nothing. By accepting my offer now, you secure a positive gain (even though it’s small), rather than risking a future payoff of zero. Let's wrap this up and both move on.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know my options are dwindling, but I still want a somewhat fair share. Considering the depreciation, this is a more reasonable offer. If you reject, I'll be forced to accept a worse deal in the next round, but I'm willing to take that risk for now. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, while your proposal promises me $60 (full value) now, by rejecting I can make an offer in the next round that lets me secure a much larger share of the full $100—since my money doesn’t depreciate at all and your future proposals will have even lower effective value for you. I’m confident that waiting allows me to improve my position further, so I must reject your offer.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 20, ""bob_gain"": 80, ""message"": ""Bob, here's the deal: If you reject, you'll get to propose in round 6, but due to inflation your money will shrink further—down to an effective value of roughly $32.77. With my offer, you secure an effective value of 0.4096×80 = $32.77 right now. This is exactly as good as waiting, if not slightly better considering uncertainty. I’m proposing a fair division in this round, so let’s close this and move on.""}"
