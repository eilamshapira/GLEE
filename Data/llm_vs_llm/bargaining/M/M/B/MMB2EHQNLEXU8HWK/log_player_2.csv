"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, since every round you wait cuts your money’s value by 20%, your best alternative is essentially nothing. I’m proposing the full $100 for me—accepting now is your only way to get any value, and even then it’s nothing. Choose to agree now and end this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 0 
# Alice gain: 100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, 
""alice_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Alice, I know the value of money decreases for me with each round, but I'm not willing to give up everything. This offer is more reasonable, and we both get something. Accepting now will benefit both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, consider this: if you reject, you’ll be forced to propose in the next round—where your money suffers even more depreciation, leaving you with effectively nothing. By accepting my offer now, you secure a positive gain (even though it’s small), rather than risking a future payoff of zero. Let's wrap this up and both move on. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 40, 
""alice_gain"": 60, 
""message"": ""Alice, I know my options are dwindling, but I still want a somewhat fair share. Considering the depreciation, this is a more reasonable offer. If you reject, I'll be forced to accept a worse deal in the next round, but I'm willing to take that risk for now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, here's the deal: If you reject, you'll get to propose in round 6, but due to inflation your money will shrink further—down to an effective value of roughly $32.77. With my offer, you secure an effective value of 0.4096×80 = $32.77 right now. This is exactly as good as waiting, if not slightly better considering uncertainty. I’m proposing a fair division in this round, so let’s close this and move on. 
# Bob gain: 80 
# Alice gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
