"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a reasonable first offer, considering that inflation will reduce the value by 20% each round if Bob declines.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this split because:
1. It gives me a fair majority while still offering Bob a substantial amount
2. If Bob declines, the total value will decrease by 20% next round, making it in his interest to consider accepting
3. It's not too greedy, which might encourage cooperation"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 20% inflation for me, if I accept Bob's offer:
I would get $4500, but due to inflation it's worth $3600 (4500 * 0.8)
Bob would get $5500 at full value

If I reject, we go to round 3 where I can make an offer, but I'll face 40% total inflation on my share.

Given that:
1. The offer gives me a reasonable amount even with inflation
2. Rejecting means even more value loss for me in future rounds
3. There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal later with increasing inflation
