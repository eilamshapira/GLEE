"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically:

1. Alice is offering me 4000$ (40% of the total)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. There's no inflation penalty for me
4. We have plenty of rounds left (11 more)
5. I can likely negotiate a better deal

Since this is the first round and I have no inflation pressure, I can afford to be a bit aggressive in negotiating for a better share.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer, but still favorable to me:

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

My reasoning:
1. I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor
2. This is more equitable than Alice's initial 60-40 split (in her favor)
3. It's not so extreme that it's likely to be rejected
4. If Alice rejects, she'll have to make a counter-offer, and we still have many rounds left
5. Since I know I don't have inflation pressure, I can afford to be somewhat aggressive, but not too much to risk prolonging the negotiation unnecessarily"
