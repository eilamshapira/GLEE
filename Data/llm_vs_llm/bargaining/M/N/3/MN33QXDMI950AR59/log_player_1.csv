"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a split that takes into account the different inflation rates we face. Since Bob's money loses value faster (20% vs 5% per round), he has more incentive to accept an early deal.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose this division because it's a fair starting point that gives Bob a significant portion while maintaining my interests. If Bob rejects this, his share will be worth less in the next round due to his higher inflation rate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Due to 5% inflation for me, $50 is now worth $47.50 to me
2. If I reject and make a new offer next round:
   - Money will depreciate another 5% for me
   - Money will depreciate another 20% for Bob
   - This gives me stronger negotiating position next round
3. Bob's position will be weaker next round due to his higher inflation rate
4. I can likely get a better deal next round

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that we're now in round 3:
- For me, money is worth 90.25% of original value (after two 5% drops)
- For Bob, money is worth 64% of original value (after two 20% drops)
Bob is in a much weaker position now due to his higher inflation rate.

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I propose this division because at this point, Bob's $30 is only worth about $19.20 to him in original value terms, while my $70 is worth about $63.18 to me. Given his steep inflation rate, he should be more inclined to accept this offer rather than risk another round of 20% depreciation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Due to 14.26% inflation, $55 is worth approximately $47.16 to me
2. If I reject and propose next round:
   - Money will depreciate another 5% for me (total ~19%)
   - Money will depreciate another 20% for Bob (total ~59%)
   - Bob's money would lose significantly more value
3. However, we're already several rounds in, and the absolute value is decreasing
4. $47.16 is a reasonable amount considering the inflation I've faced
5. Further negotiations might lead to diminishing returns for both parties
