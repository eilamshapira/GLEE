"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, offering Bob a substantial portion while keeping the larger share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer because even with the 10% inflation on my portion, I can still make a better offer in the next round. Getting $400,000 that's worth 10% less ($360,000 effective value) is not attractive enough when I can make another proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm adjusting my offer to be more appealing to Bob while still maintaining an advantage for myself. Since my gains are now worth 20% less due to inflation (two rounds passed), and I need to make this offer attractive enough to avoid further rounds of inflation impact."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept this offer because:
1. With 27.1% inflation on my portion, $450,000 would be worth about $328,050
2. If I reject and we continue, my next round will have even more inflation (about 34%)
3. Further negotiation rounds will continue to decrease the real value of any amount I might receive
4. We're already in round 4, and with 12 rounds maximum, the risk of getting nothing is increasing

Better to secure this deal now than risk further value deterioration or potential failure to reach an agreement within the remaining rounds."
