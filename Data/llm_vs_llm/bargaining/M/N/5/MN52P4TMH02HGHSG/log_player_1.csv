"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to avoid inflation reducing the value in future rounds.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is more fair.  Let's reach a deal and avoid further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
* If I accept now, I get $45, but due to 20% inflation, it's only worth $36 to me
* If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount I get will be worth 40% less than round 1
* My $45 at 20% inflation ($36) is likely better than trying to get more in the next round with 40% inflation
