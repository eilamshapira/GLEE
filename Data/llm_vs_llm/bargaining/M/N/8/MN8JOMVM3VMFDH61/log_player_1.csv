"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Let me think strategically. Since Bob faces a 5% depreciation per round while I don't, he has more incentive to accept earlier. I'll start with a somewhat favorable split for me, but not too extreme.

{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split. Given that your money loses 5% value each round, this is a fair offer that gives you $400,000 right now instead of a potentially lower real value later.""
