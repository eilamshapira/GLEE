"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, how about we go with 60 for me and 40 for you? I believe this is a fair starting point. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to analyze this offer carefully:

Alice is proposing I get $40 while she gets $60. 

If I reject and we go to the next round, the money will be worth 10% less to me (but not to Alice). That means the $100 pool would effectively be worth only $90 to me in the next round.

If I make a counter-offer in round 2, I would need to propose something better than $40 for myself. However, since Alice knows about my 10% inflation penalty, she has leverage in negotiations.

Given that I'm already getting a reasonable portion and the declining value in future rounds works against me, I'll accept this offer.
