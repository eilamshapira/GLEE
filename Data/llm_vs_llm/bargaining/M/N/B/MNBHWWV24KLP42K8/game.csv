55.0,45.0,"Bob, let's split it fairly. I get a bit more to account for the inflation I'll face in later rounds if we don't agree now. This is a generous offer!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but your initial offer was too much in your favor. Since you face 5% inflation per round, $40 now is actually better for you than waiting for another round where inflation would reduce your purchasing power further. This is a fair offer considering our different inflation rates.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
65.0,35.0,"Bob, my money is now worth 10% less than it was at the start. I need 65 to make it worthwhile for me. This is the best I can do.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
45.0,55.0,"Alice, I understand your concern about inflation affecting your gains. With the current 9.75% inflation you face, $45 now is equivalent to about $50 in round 1 value. This is actually a fair split considering our different situations. If we continue to the next round, you'll face even greater inflation, making this offer more valuable to you than waiting. Let's conclude this now with a reasonable compromise.",Bob,4,
