"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but your initial offer was too much in your favor. Since you face 5% inflation per round, $40 now is actually better for you than waiting for another round where inflation would reduce your purchasing power further. This is a fair offer considering our different inflation rates. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation affecting your gains. With the current 9.75% inflation you face, $45 now is equivalent to about $50 in round 1 value. This is actually a fair split considering our different situations. If we continue to the next round, you'll face even greater inflation, making this offer more valuable to you than waiting. Let's conclude this now with a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
