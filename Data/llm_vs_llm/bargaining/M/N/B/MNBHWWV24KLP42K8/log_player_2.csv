"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's split it fairly. I get a bit more to account for the inflation I'll face in later rounds if we don't agree now. This is a generous offer! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I should consider this offer carefully. Alice is asking for $55 while offering me $45, claiming it accounts for her 5% inflation penalty per round. If I reject, we go to the next round where I make an offer, but her money would be worth 5% less.

Looking at the numbers: If we go to round 2 and I offer a 50/50 split, the $50 would be worth only $47.50 to Alice due to the 5% inflation she faces. From that perspective, her current offer of $55 now versus potentially less effective money later has some logic.

However, I could potentially get more than $45 if I make a counter-offer. Since I don't face inflation penalties, I should try to maximize my share.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, 
""alice_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but your initial offer was too much in your favor. Since you face 5% inflation per round, $40 now is actually better for you than waiting for another round where inflation would reduce your purchasing power further. This is a fair offer considering our different inflation rates.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my money is now worth 10% less than it was at the start. I need 65 to make it worthwhile for me. This is the best I can do. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully analyze Alice's new offer.

Alice is now offering me $35 while taking $65, claiming she needs more due to the inflation she faces. The money I receive doesn't lose value over rounds, but Alice's does (now 9.75% less value for her).

If I reject and we go to round 4, her inflation penalty increases further. However, her current offer gives me significantly less than my previous offer to her, and even less than her first offer to me.

Since I don't face inflation penalties, waiting doesn't hurt me financially. I can make another counter-offer in the next round that's more balanced, considering her inflation but not accepting such a low amount.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concern about inflation affecting your gains. With the current 9.75% inflation you face, $45 now is equivalent to about $50 in round 1 value. This is actually a fair split considering our different situations. If we continue to the next round, you'll face even greater inflation, making this offer more valuable to you than waiting. Let's conclude this now with a reasonable compromise.""}"
