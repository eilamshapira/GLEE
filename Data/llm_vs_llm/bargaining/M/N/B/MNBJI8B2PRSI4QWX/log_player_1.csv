"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a reasonable offer that gives me a slight advantage but should be acceptable to Bob, considering I need to account for the 20% inflation risk if we go to another round.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose a 55-45 split in my favor, which is relatively fair while giving me a small advantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
* If I accept now, I'll get $40, but it's worth 20% less due to inflation, so effectively $32
* If I reject and propose in the next round, any amount will be worth even less (40% less than original)
* Bob's offer gives him a significant advantage ($60)
* However, continuing to negotiate means risking further value loss

Given the significant inflation penalty and the risk of further rounds reducing the value even more, I'll accept this offer. Even though it's not ideal, $32 effective value is better than risking further depreciation.
