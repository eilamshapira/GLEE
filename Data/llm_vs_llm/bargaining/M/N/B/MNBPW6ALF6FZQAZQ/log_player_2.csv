"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000
2. This is a 40-60 split in Alice's favor
3. If I reject, the money will be worth 5% less to me in the next round
4. We have 11 more rounds, but each delay costs me value
5. 40% is less than an equal split, and since this is the first round, I can try to negotiate for better terms

I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while acknowledging the time pressure on my side:

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's do a fair 50-50 split. This is equitable for both of us, and I'm losing value with each round due to inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, 58-42 is a fair compromise 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $4,200, but due to 9.75% inflation, it's actually worth about $3,790 to me
2. This is slightly better than her first offer in real terms
3. If I reject, the next round will have 14.75% inflation for me
4. We still have 9 rounds left, but my negotiating power is decreasing with each round due to inflation
5. Alice seems to be acknowledging the inflation factor and making a slightly better offer

While I'd prefer a more equal split, the inflation is working against me, and this offer is better than the first one. I'll accept it.
