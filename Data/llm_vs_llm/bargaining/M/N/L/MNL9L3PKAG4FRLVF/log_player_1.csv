"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know that waiting further cuts into the value of our money—even more for me than it does for you. To keep things fair given our different discount rates, I’m proposing that I receive $357100 and you get $642900. This split reflects what you’d reasonably expect if you got to propose next round, so let’s settle now before we lose even more value. 
# Alice gain: 642900 
# Bob gain: 357100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
