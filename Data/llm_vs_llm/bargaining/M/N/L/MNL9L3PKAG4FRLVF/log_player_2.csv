Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 357100, ""alice_gain"": 642900, ""message"": ""Alice, I know that waiting further cuts into the value of our money—even more for me than it does for you. To keep things fair given our different discount rates, I’m proposing that I receive $357,100 and you get $642,900. This split reflects what you’d reasonably expect if you got to propose next round, so let’s settle now before we lose even more value.""}"
