"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to propose a division of $10,000, keeping in mind the inflation that will affect me more than Bob in future rounds.

Here's my proposal:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

My reasoning: I'm proposing a split that favors me a bit, considering the higher inflation rate I'll face if we go to another round. This gives Bob a substantial amount while still giving me a reasonable advantage to compensate for potential future losses due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the inflation. My original value is now worth 80% of what it was. Bob's is worth 90% of what it was.

Let's analyze Bob's offer:

*   **Alice's gain:** $4500 (worth 80% of original value) = $3600 (effective value)
*   **Bob's gain:** $5500 (worth 90% of original value) = $4950 (effective value)

If I reject, next round my money will be worth 64% of the original.

I will accept this offer.
