"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make my first offer to Bob.

Given that inflation impacts me by 20% each round, I'm incentivized to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. However, I want to start with a reasonable offer that's favorable to me but not so one-sided that Bob immediately rejects it.

{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose this split because I believe it's a fair starting point that acknowledges I'm initiating the negotiation while still offering Bob a substantial portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that we've each rejected the other's offers, it seems we both want more than a 40/60 split. The inflation effect means I'm losing 20% value each round, so I need to be more accommodating to reach an agreement sooner.

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm lowering my request from 60 to 55 to show willingness to compromise. Since I'm affected by inflation, finding middle ground quickly is important for me, but I still want a fair share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
