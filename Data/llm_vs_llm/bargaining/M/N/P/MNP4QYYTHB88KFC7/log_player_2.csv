"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get 2000$ while she gets 8000$, which is a 20%-80% split in her favor. 

If I reject this offer, I'll have the opportunity to make a counteroffer in the next round. However, I need to account for the 5% inflation penalty, meaning the total amount to divide would be worth 9,500$ in the next round.

This doesn't seem like a fair division, and I can likely make a more equitable proposal in the next round, even accounting for inflation.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer that accounts for the 5% inflation that has already occurred. Since we're now dividing what's effectively 9,500$ in value, I'll propose a fair split that slightly favors me as the proposer but is much more equitable than Alice's initial offer.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an even 50-50 split of the original amount. This is fair to both of us and significantly better for me than Alice's initial offer. It's also better for Alice than what she might get if she rejects and we move to another round with further inflation."
