"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose an equal split of $500000 each. With every round the total value decreases (5% less for me), so it's best we agree now and avoid further erosion. I hope you see the benefit of settling today. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully, taking into account the inflation penalty.

She's offering me $500,000, which is a 50-50 split of the total amount. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me. So if I wanted the same value, I'd need to ask for $625,000 next round to match the current $500,000 offer.

Since we only have 12 rounds total and the money loses value quickly for me (20% per round), accepting a fair split now seems reasonable rather than risking further rounds of negotiation.
