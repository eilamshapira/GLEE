"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a division that takes into account the different inflation rates we face. Since Bob's money loses value faster (20% vs my 10% per round), he has more incentive to accept an early deal.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this 60-40 split because:
1. It's still a substantial amount for Bob
2. The faster depreciation rate for Bob means waiting will cost him more
3. It's a fair enough offer that should be acceptable early in the game"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer since it's not favorable to me, and the inflation impact is still relatively low at this stage. Given that Bob's money depreciates faster than mine (20% vs 10% per round), I believe I can get a better deal in the next round as the pressure on Bob increases."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that we're now in round 3, and both Bob and I have rejected previous offers, I'll adjust my offer to be more appealing while still maintaining my advantage. The money is now worth less for both of us (20% less valuable for me, 40% less valuable for Bob compared to round 1).

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm proposing a more balanced 55-45 split because:
1. Bob's money is depreciating faster, increasing pressure to accept
2. It's more generous than my first offer
3. The longer we wait, the less valuable the total amount becomes for both of us
4. It's a reasonable compromise that should be attractive to Bob"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because:
1. The inflation is becoming significant, especially for Bob (48.8% loss)
2. My portion (4500) with 27.1% inflation is still worth about 3280 in round 1 value
3. Further negotiations might lead to worse outcomes as the total value continues to decrease
4. The offer is reasonably balanced (45-55 split)
5. We're already in round 4, and with 12 rounds maximum, we need to reach an agreement before the money becomes too devalued"
