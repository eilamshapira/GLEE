"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split, let's end this! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me after each round, I'll make a reasonable offer to Alice. Considering it's the second round, I'll aim for a fair split, taking into account the decreasing value.

{""bob_gain"": 525000, 
""alice_gain"": 475000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, considering the decreasing value""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer, slightly better for you 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect on both of us, I notice that Alice's offer is not as favorable as it seems, given that her gain is worth 19% less. Meanwhile, my gain is worth 9.75% less. I'll think about the decreasing value and try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth even less for both of us now, and considering Alice's previous offer, I'll try to make a more appealing proposal. I'll aim for a split that takes into account the decreasing value and tries to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground before it's too late""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, don't let inflation win 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the increasing inflation effect on both of us, I should consider that Alice's gain is worth significantly less (34.39%) compared to mine (18.55%). This changes the dynamics of the negotiation. Alice's offer, although not ideal, might be more reasonable considering the circumstances.
