"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the rules.

Let's analyze the situation. I'm being offered $400,000 in round 1. I need to consider the implications of rejecting the offer, namely the 5% inflation penalty in each round. If I reject, I get to make the offer in round 2.

Let's consider the best and worst-case scenarios:

*   **Worst Case:** We go all the way to round 12. The $400,000 in round 1 is equivalent to $400,000 * (0.95)^0 after adjusting for zero rounds passed.

*   **Consider Round 2:** If I reject and I offer Alice a fair deal such as 500,000 for each.
    Then I would gain 500,000 * 0.95.

*   **Accepting Now:** $400,000 immediately.

Let's calculate the value after discount if this drags on:

After 1 round, to get $400,000 of current value, I need $400,000/0.95 = 421052.63
After 2 rounds, to get $400,000 of current value, I need $400,000/0.95^2 = 443213.30
After 3 rounds, to get $400,000 of current value, I need $400,000/0.95^3 = 466539.26
...
After 11 rounds, to get $400,000 of current value, I need $400,000/0.95^11 = 683189.02

Alice gets $600,000 now, but I don't know her discount rate.

I think the best course of action is to accept now.
