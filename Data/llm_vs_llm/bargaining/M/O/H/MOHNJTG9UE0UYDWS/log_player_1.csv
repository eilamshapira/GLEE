"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand. My offer for Round 1 is:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I must decide whether to accept Bob's offer in Round 2.

My perspective:

*   **My Gain (Alice):** $6000 (This is what I'll actually receive)
*   **Inflation Impact:** Due to inflation, the value of my money decreases by 10% compared to Round 1.

Since the question asks about my decision, the answer is:

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand. Due to inflation, my money is worth 10% less than in round 1 and Bob's money is worth 20% less than in the first round.

My offer for Round 3 is:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```"
