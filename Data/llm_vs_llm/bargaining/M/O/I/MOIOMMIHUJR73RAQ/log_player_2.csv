"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly and avoid inflation losses. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which is equal on the surface. However, I need to consider the inflation effect. If I reject and we move to the next round, the money will be worth 5% less to me, meaning the $100 would only be worth $95 in the next round. Even if I could get more than 50% in the next round, the total value would be decreased.

A 50-50 split is fair, and accepting now means I avoid the inflation penalty completely.
