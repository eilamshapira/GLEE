550000.0,450000.0,"Alice, I know that in round 3 you secured 550000 nominal for yourself—even though its value is discounted due to inflation—so to avoid any further erosion of your gains, I'm proposing the very same division: I get 450000 and you get 550000. Accepting now safeguards your share from additional risk, and I believe it's best for both of us.",Bob,4,
