Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, because my share remains undiminished while yours might be at risk from inflation in later rounds, I'm offering a slightly favorable split for both of us. Accepting now secures you a solid amount without the uncertainty of future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know that in round 3 you secured 550000 nominal for yourself—even though its value is discounted due to inflation—so to avoid any further erosion of your gains, I'm proposing the very same division: I get 450000 and you get 550000. Accepting now safeguards your share from additional risk, and I believe it's best for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000
