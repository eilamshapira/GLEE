"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the inflation effect, the $4500 offered to me in this round is effectively worth 36% less than it would have been in the first round. Let's calculate the real value:

Real value of $4500 after 36% inflation:
\[ 4500 \times (1 - 0.36) = 4500 \times 0.64 = 2880 \]

So, the offer is essentially worth $2880 to me in terms of Round 1 value.

Since the value is significantly reduced and I might get a better deal in the next round even with further inflation, I decide to reject the offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given the inflation rate of 20% per round, the value of the money for me is reducing significantly each round. By this round, the money is worth 52% less than its original value.

To make a reasonable offer that Alice might accept, while considering the impact of inflation, I should propose a division that still provides a good deal for Alice but also ensures I get a fair share.

Here's my offer for Round 4:

```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""alice_gain"": 5000
}
```"
