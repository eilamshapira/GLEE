Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: Alice, let's split it evenly. It's fair and considering the inflation rates, it's a good deal for both of us.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the rapid decrease in value due to inflation, especially for you, this offer is more than fair. Let's settle this now before it gets worse. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This offer is barely acceptable. While I'd prefer a larger share, the impact of inflation is becoming increasingly significant. Accepting now secures me a reasonable amount, even if it's less than initially desired."
