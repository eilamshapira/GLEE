"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split the money with me taking 60% and you getting 40%. This way, we both get a significant amount and can end the game early, avoiding the impact of inflation on our shares. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I think a more equitable split is in order. How about we go with a 55/45 split in my favor? This reflects that I'm taking on a greater risk with inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, since we're now in round 3 and inflation is affecting us differently, I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This way, we can still end the game early and secure a good amount for both of us before the value decreases further. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

I need to hold strong for a better offer. While the money is losing value, letting Alice get 55% after I offered a similar deal is not a winning strategy."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm willing to come down slightly from my previous offer. A 52/48 split in my favor seems fair given the circumstances. We need to close this deal soon!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, considering the rapid decrease in value due to inflation, especially for you, I'm proposing a 52/48 split in my favor. This is a fair compromise given our current situation, and it allows us to end the game before the money loses even more value. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is getting too risky.  Alice is unlikely to go any lower, and the penalties from inflation are getting severe on my end. It's better to secure something now than risk getting nothing."
