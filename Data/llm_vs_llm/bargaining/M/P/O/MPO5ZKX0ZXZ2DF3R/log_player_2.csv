"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000, which is 40% of the total. 

If I reject and move to the next round, I should consider that:
1. I'll get to make the next offer
2. The money will be worth 5% less to me (so the $1,000,000 would be worth $950,000 to me)
3. Alice has no inflation penalty

Since I can make a better offer in the next round, and even with 5% inflation I could potentially secure more than $400,000 in value, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair offer that accounts for the inflation penalty I face.

Since we're in round 2, I'm already facing a 5% inflation penalty. If we continue to later rounds, my position weakens while Alice's remains the same. It makes sense to propose a division that gives me a bit more to account for this disadvantage.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering you $450,000 Alice, which is 45% of the total. This is a fair division considering I face inflation penalties in future rounds while you don't. If we keep rejecting offers, we both risk getting nothing, so this balanced split benefits us both."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice has actually reduced her offer to me from $400,000 in round 1 to $350,000 now. This is concerning, especially since the inflation penalty is increasing.

Let me analyze this situation:
- We're in round 3, so I'm facing a 9.75% inflation penalty
- The $350,000 offered to me is actually worth about $315,875 to me after inflation
- If I reject, I can make another offer, but I'll face a higher inflation penalty
- We have 12 rounds total, and if we can't agree, we both get zero

Alice's negotiation strategy seems to be getting more aggressive, not more compromising. If this pattern continues, we risk not reaching an agreement.

However, I still think I can do better by making another counter-offer, so I'll reject this offer.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I notice that Alice reduced her offer to me between rounds 1 and 3, which suggests she may be trying to leverage my inflation penalty against me. I need to make a reasonable offer that acknowledges our situation while ensuring we reach an agreement before we run out of rounds.

{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000}

Alice, I'm offering you $480,000, which is 48% of the total - an improvement from my previous offer. I've moderated my request because I understand we need to find middle ground. The inflation penalty I face (now 14.26% if we go to round 5) means delays hurt me more than you. Let's avoid the risk of both getting nothing if we reach round 12 without agreement. This offer is fair and considers both our positions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice Alice has increased her offer to me from $350,000 in round 3 to $420,000 now, which shows some movement toward compromise.

Let me analyze this situation:
- We're in round 5, with a 18.55% inflation penalty for me
- The $420,000 offered to me is actually worth about $342,090 to me after inflation
- We're approaching the halfway point of our 12 rounds
- If we can't agree by the end, we both get zero

Alice has shown willingness to improve her offer, moving from $350K to $420K. While I initially asked for more, the increasing inflation penalty means my bargaining position weakens with each round. The risk of getting nothing is real if we continue this pattern.

Given the improved offer and the increasing inflation penalty, I'll accept this offer.
