"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer to divide the $10,000 between Bob and me.

Given the inflation information provided, while my money doesn't lose value between rounds, Bob's money loses 20% of its value each round. This gives me some negotiation leverage, as waiting is more costly for Bob than for me.

I'll offer a fair split that acknowledges this dynamic but isn't too aggressive:

{""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this 60/40 split since waiting would be costly for you, Bob. With 20% inflation for you each round, the $4,000 now is worth more than waiting for a potentially better offer next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new offer that takes into account our negotiation position.

Since Bob rejected my initial 60/40 split and countered with a 45/55 split in his favor, I'll propose a more moderate split that still acknowledges the inflation pressure on Bob's side.

{""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500}

Bob, consider that with 20% inflation affecting your gains each round, this $4,500 now is worth more to you than what you might get after another round of negotiation. If we go to round 4, your $5,500 would be worth about $4,400 in round 3 terms. This offer is fair and accounts for our respective positions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new offer that accounts for our negotiation positions and the increasing inflation pressure on Bob.

With each round, Bob's gains are worth significantly less due to the 20% inflation per round. We're now in round 5, and the inflation has accumulated to nearly 50% from the first round for Bob, while my value remains stable.

{""alice_gain"": 5800,
""bob_gain"": 4200}

Bob, I recommend accepting this offer. Due to the compounding inflation effect on your gains, if we continue to round 6, even if you proposed a higher nominal amount for yourself, the real value would be substantially diminished. At this point, $4,200 now is worth more to you than a larger number in the next round. This split acknowledges our respective negotiation positions and the time-value dynamics at play."
