"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split, let's end this! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. Alice is offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000.

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 10% less to me. So next round, the full million would only be worth $900,000 to me.

A 60-40 split in Alice's favor isn't terrible, but I think I can get a better deal. Since we have 12 rounds total and this is just round 1, I have room to negotiate. Even with the inflation penalty, I believe I can propose a more equitable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while acknowledging the time pressure we both face.

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. This is equitable for both of us, and we can avoid losing value to inflation by agreeing now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer: 58-42, considering inflation, this is more than fair. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Due to 19% inflation for me, Alice's offer of $420,000 is actually worth $340,200 to me (420,000 * 0.81)

2. If I reject and we go to next round:
- Inflation will increase to 29% for me
- I can make a counter-offer, but the value will be even lower
- We've already used 3 of 12 rounds

3. Alice has moved from 60-40 to 58-42, showing willingness to negotiate
- The actual monetary difference between this offer and my 50-50 proposal isn't huge
- Given the inflation effects, waiting longer could hurt both of us

While I might ideally want a 50-50 split, the inflation factor makes this current offer reasonable, and continuing to negotiate might result in less actual value for both of us.
