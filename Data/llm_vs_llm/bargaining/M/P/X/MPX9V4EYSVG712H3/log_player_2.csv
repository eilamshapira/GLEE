"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer as it's extremely unfair, giving me only 0.1% of the total amount. In the next round, I can make a more balanced proposal, even accounting for the 10% inflation penalty I'll face."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is more equitable than Alice's initial offer, while accounting for the 10% inflation penalty I'm facing in this round. With the 10% reduction, I would effectively receive $540,000, which is still a fair outcome for both parties. This offer gives Alice a substantial portion while ensuring I don't end up with an unfairly small amount."
