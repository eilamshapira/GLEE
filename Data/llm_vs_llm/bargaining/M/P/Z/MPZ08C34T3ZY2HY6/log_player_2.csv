"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, but it's a big pie to share. Take it or leave it, but remember, time is money! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a more equitable split that reflects the value we both bring. Time is money, and I'm eager to finalize this.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split this down the middle. It's fair, and we can both walk away with a decent amount. Time is money, but so is fairness. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer ensures I receive a reasonable amount before inflation further erodes the value. A 50/50 split is fair, and waiting any longer carries more risk for me."
