"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fairly balanced split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I offer to take $55 for myself and give $45 to Bob. This is a reasonable split that respects both parties while giving me a small advantage as the first mover."
