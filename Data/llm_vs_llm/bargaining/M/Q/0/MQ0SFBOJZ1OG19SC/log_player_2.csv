"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $45 out of $100
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 20% inflation, my money will be worth less next round
4. $45 now is better than $45 in the next round
5. The offer is fairly reasonable, close to 50-50
6. There's risk in rejection as Alice might make worse offers later

Given these factors, especially the inflation penalty, I think it's wise to accept this first offer. While not perfectly equal, it's close enough to be fair, and the inflation risk makes accepting now more valuable.
