"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think this split is more reflective of the game's dynamics. Let's not waste time with further rounds.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle, considering inflation 
# Bob gain: 42.5 
# Alice gain: 57.5 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This offer is better than my previous offer, and given the inflation working against Alice, it's unlikely I'll get a better deal in future rounds."
