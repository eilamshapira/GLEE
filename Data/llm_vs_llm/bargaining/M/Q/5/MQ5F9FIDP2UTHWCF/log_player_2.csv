"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

Alice is proposing an even 50-50 split of the $10,000, giving each of us $5,000.

Since it's the first round, there's no inflation yet. If I reject and we go to round 2, I'd be making the next offer but the money would be worth 10% less to me. That means in round 2, the full $10,000 would only be worth $9,000 to me.

A 50-50 split is fair, and considering the inflation penalty I face in future rounds, accepting now seems like the rational choice.
