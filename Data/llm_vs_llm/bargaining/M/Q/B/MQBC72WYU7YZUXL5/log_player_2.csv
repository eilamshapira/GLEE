"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $450,000 out of $1,000,000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. However, due to 10% inflation, the money will be worth less to me in the next round
4. $450,000 now is better than potentially getting $500,000 in the next round (which would be worth $450,000 to me due to inflation)
5. The offer is fairly reasonable, close to a 50-50 split

Given these factors, especially considering the inflation penalty, I'll accept this offer.
