5500.0,4500.0,Let's split it fairly! I get a bit more because I'm making the first offer. What do you say?,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I took the first rejection, now it's your turn. Let's see if you're willing to compromise.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"Okay, Bob, let's try this again. This offer takes into account the inflation and that you rejected my previous offer. I am proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, which considering the circumstances, is still a reasonable deal for you!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4200.0,5800.0,"Considering the inflation is affecting me more, I think this is a fair counteroffer. It's time for you to make a concession.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
6500.0,3500.0,"Bob, we're wasting time and money with each round. Inflation is killing us both, but it's hitting you harder. I'm offering a 65/35 split. This is the best you're going to get from me. Take it or we both lose out big time.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
4400.0,5600.0,"I know inflation is hurting me more, but I'm not desperate yet. You need to meet me halfway if you want a deal. This is my compromise.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
7000.0,3000.0,"Bob, this is it. Final offer. 70/30. Inflation is destroying the value. You're losing more with each rejection. Take this or we get nothing. This is as good as it gets!",Alice,7,
