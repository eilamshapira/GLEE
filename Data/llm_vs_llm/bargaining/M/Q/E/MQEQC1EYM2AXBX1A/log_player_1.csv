"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. Here's my first offer, keeping in mind the different inflation rates for Alice and Bob:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

My reasoning: I'm starting with a proposal that gives me a slight advantage. I think Bob will accept this because he still gets a significant portion, and he knows the value of the money decreases for him faster than it does for me in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Reasoning: Even though I initially proposed a higher share for myself, Bob's offer of $45 is reasonable, especially considering that rejecting it means I risk getting even less in future rounds due to inflation for Bob. Accepting now guarantees me $45 which is still a good outcome."
