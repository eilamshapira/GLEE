"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer...

This is a fair 50-50 split of the $100, which is generally considered the most equitable division. While I could try to negotiate for more in the next round, there's also a risk that we might end up with worse offers or fail to reach an agreement within the 12 rounds, resulting in both of us getting nothing.

Given that this is a perfectly fair offer right from the start, I'll accept it.
