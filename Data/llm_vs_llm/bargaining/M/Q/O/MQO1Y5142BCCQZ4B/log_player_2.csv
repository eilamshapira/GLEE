"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's start with a fair offer. 60 for me, 40 for you. We can avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer and decide whether to accept it or reject it and make a counter-offer in the next round.

Alice has offered me $40 out of $100, while taking $60 for herself. If I reject, we'll move to round 2, but the total money will be worth 5% less (so $95 total). 

Let me think strategically. If I make a counter-offer, I could propose a more even split, but we'd only have $95 to divide. And Alice might reject my offer too, leading to further inflation.

Given that I'd still get a substantial amount ($40) and we avoid the 5% inflation penalty, I'll accept this offer.
