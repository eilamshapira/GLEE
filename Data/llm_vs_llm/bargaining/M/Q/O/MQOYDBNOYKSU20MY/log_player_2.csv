Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The offer is quite uneven, favoring Alice significantly with an 80-20 split. Given that we still have several rounds left and the 20% inflation penalty isn't too severe yet, I'll make a counter-proposal in the next round that's more balanced."
