"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice offered me $45, keeping $55 for herself. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
- For me, $100 stays worth $100 (0% inflation)
- For Alice, $100 will be worth $90 (10% inflation)

This means I could offer a split that gives Alice less in absolute dollars but similar relative value to her current offer. I could potentially negotiate a better deal for myself.

Therefore, I will reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice faces 10% inflation in each round, while I don't, I can use this to my advantage.

Alice's previous offer of $55 to herself is now only worth $49.5 to her (due to 10% inflation). I can offer her slightly more than this in relative value while keeping more for myself.

I'll propose:

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

This $40 offer to Alice is worth about the same to her as $44.4 in the previous round due to inflation ($40 รท 0.9 = $44.4), so it's not too far from what she was willing to accept for herself initially. Meanwhile, I get a better deal at $60.

The offer is fair considering the inflation factor, and it should be reasonable enough for Alice to accept rather than risk another round of inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is now offering me $55 (worth full value to me)
2. She's taking $45 for herself (which is worth only 81% of original value to her, so about $36.45 in round 1 terms)
3. If I reject:
   - Next round, her money will be worth 29% less than round 1
   - I could potentially get more, but Alice might reject again
   - We risk losing more total value through continued inflation

This is actually a good offer for me:
- I get more than the initial $45 offered in round 1
- The $55 is worth full value to me
- It's a fair split considering the inflation effect on Alice's side

I'll accept this offer.
