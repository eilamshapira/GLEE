"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $40 and she gets $60 out of the $100. 

While this isn't an equal split, it's also not an unreasonable offer. According to the rules, if I reject, I'll get to make a counter-offer in the next round. However, the money doesn't lose value for me with inflation (0% effect), but I don't know how inflation affects Alice.

Since I'm getting a substantial portion ($40) and there's no guarantee that Alice would accept a more favorable counter-offer from me, I'll accept this offer.
