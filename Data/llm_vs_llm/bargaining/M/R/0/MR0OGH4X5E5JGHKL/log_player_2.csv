"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer from Alice.

Alice is offering me $475,000 out of the $1,000,000, while she takes $525,000. This is close to a 50-50 split, but gives her a slight advantage of $50,000.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value decreases by 5% to $950,000. This means even if I proposed a perfectly fair 50-50 split in the next round, we'd each get $475,000. If I tried to get more than that, Alice might reject.

Looking at what I'm being offered now ($475,000) versus what I might realistically get in the next round (likely $475,000 or possibly less if negotiations continue), accepting this offer seems reasonable.
