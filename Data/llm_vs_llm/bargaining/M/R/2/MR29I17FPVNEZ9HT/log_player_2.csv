"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair division. I believe this is a good compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""My turn, a bit more balanced, don't you think?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my revised offer. I think it's a step toward a fairer split. 
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $5200 I would gain is actually worth approximately $5200 * 0.64 = $3328 in the original value.
Given this, I think it's a relatively fair offer, especially since the value will continue to decrease with each round.
