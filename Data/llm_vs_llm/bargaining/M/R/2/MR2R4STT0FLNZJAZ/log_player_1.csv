"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 9999, ""bob_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Hi Bob – here's my proposal: I keep $9,999 and you get $1. I know it looks lopsided, but remember: your money loses 10% of its value every round, while mine doesn’t. Waiting until the next round would leave you with even less real value. Accept now and we both walk away immediately with our respective amounts.""}"
