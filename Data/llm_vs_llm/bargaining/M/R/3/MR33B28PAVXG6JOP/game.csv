4800.0,5200.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we settle this round with a division of $10000 where you get $5200 and I receive $4800. Since my portion loses 5% of its value each round due to inflation, it benefits both of us to conclude the deal now. I believe this split acknowledges the time pressure on me while keeping the division fair. Looking forward to your response.",Alice,1,

4600.0,5400.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your previous offer, but considering the inflation effect on my side, I would like to propose a slight adjustment. How about I take $5400 and you take $4600? This way, we both still get a fair share while accounting for the devaluation over time. Let's settle this round.",Bob,2,
