"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 4800, ""bob_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we settle this round with a division of $10,000 where you get $5200 and I receive $4800. Since my portion loses 5% of its value each round due to inflation, it benefits both of us to conclude the deal now. I believe this split acknowledges the time pressure on me while keeping the division fair. Looking forward to your response.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your previous offer, but considering the inflation effect on my side, I would like to propose a slight adjustment. How about I take $5400 and you take $4600? This way, we both still get a fair share while accounting for the devaluation over time. Let's settle this round. 
# Alice gain: 4600 
# Bob gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
