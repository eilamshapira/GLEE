"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, considering I need to make it attractive enough for Bob to accept, but also accounting for the 5% inflation risk if he declines.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I offer Bob $450,000 and I keep $550,000. This is a reasonable split that gives Bob a significant portion while accounting for my inflation risk in future rounds."
