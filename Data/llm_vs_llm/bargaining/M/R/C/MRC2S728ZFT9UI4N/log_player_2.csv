"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I receive $450,000 while she gets $550,000. 

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, I should account for the 5% inflation, meaning the total value to me would be $950,000. I could potentially propose a more favorable split, but Alice might reject it, leading to further rounds and more inflation.

Since this is a reasonable first offer (45% for me, 55% for Alice), and considering the inflation penalty for delaying, I'll accept.
