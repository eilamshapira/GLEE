Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the higher inflation rate on my side, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. Let's settle this quickly before our money loses more value! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Okay, let's try this again. Accounting for the inflation and the fact that we're already in round 3, I need to make a more appealing offer to avoid further losses.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 48,
  ""bob_gain"": 52,
  ""message"": ""Okay Bob, I understand your inflation is higher. To compensate, I'm offering you $52. Let's end this now and both get a good deal before our money loses even more value!""
}
