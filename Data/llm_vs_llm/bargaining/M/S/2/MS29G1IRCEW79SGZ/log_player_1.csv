"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer to Bob that's fair but takes into account the 5% inflation penalty I face with each round.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose this division because I believe it's reasonable to ask for slightly more than half given that I face a 5% inflation penalty for each round we delay. This way, both of us can walk away with a significant portion of the money without risking further rounds where the total value decreases for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to be more strategic given Bob rejected my first offer and countered with one favoring himself.

{""alice_gain"": 53, ""bob_gain"": 47}

I'm adjusting my offer to be more appealing to Bob while still accounting for my inflation penalty. Since I face a 10% cumulative inflation penalty after two rounds, a 53/47 split would help offset some of that loss while being more accommodating than my initial proposal. This creates a fair middle ground that respects both our interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 47 
# Bob gain: 53 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
