"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering I face 5% inflation each round, which means accepting a fairer split now is beneficial for both of us rather than prolonging negotiations where my purchasing power decreases.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. While I'm open to negotiation, the value of the money decreases significantly for me with each round. A quick agreement benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
