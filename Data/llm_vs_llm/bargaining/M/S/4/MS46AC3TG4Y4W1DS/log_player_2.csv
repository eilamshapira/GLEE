"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering I face 5% inflation each round, which means accepting a fairer split now is beneficial for both of us rather than prolonging negotiations where my purchasing power decreases. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice's mention of her own inflation is interesting, but it doesn't guarantee she's telling the truth about its impact on her. I'm willing to gamble that her inflation is either lower than she claims or that she's bluffing to get a better deal."
