"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share, let's end early 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $4000 out of $10000 (40%)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 20% inflation, the total value will decrease to $8000 in the next round
4. My potential maximum gain in the next round would be less than this round

While the split isn't exactly 50-50, rejecting would mean dealing with a smaller total amount. The 40% of the full amount might be better than a larger percentage of a reduced amount.
