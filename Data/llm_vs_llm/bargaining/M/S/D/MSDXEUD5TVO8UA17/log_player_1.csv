"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split, considering I need to make it attractive enough for Bob to accept while accounting for the 5% inflation penalty if we go to the next round.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'll add this explanation for Bob: ""I propose a slightly favorable split for me at 55-45, considering the time value of money. This is a fair offer that gives you a substantial portion while avoiding the risk of value loss through inflation."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept, I'll get $49, but it's worth 5% less due to inflation, so effectively $46.55
2. If I reject, we go to round 3 where I can make an offer, but my gains will be worth 10% less than original value
3. Bob's offer is relatively fair, just slightly in his favor
4. The longer we negotiate, the more value I lose due to inflation
5. There's no guarantee I can get a better deal in future rounds given the inflation penalty

Given these considerations, I should accept this reasonable offer now rather than risk further value loss.
