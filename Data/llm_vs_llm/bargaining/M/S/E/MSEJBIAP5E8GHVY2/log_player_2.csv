Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While this offer is significantly worse for me than Alice's first offer, it's still better than letting the game go on. However, there's a chance Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation more strongly than she's letting on. By rejecting this offer, I'm signaling that I'm willing to risk further inflation for a better deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a slightly better deal for Alice than her last offer, while still trying to secure a significant portion for myself.  This balances my desire for a good outcome with the risk of further inflation."
