500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we split the $1000000 equally â€” $500k each. Every round of delay reduces my share's value by 5%, so settling now not only gives us both a fair split but also avoids further losses. I hope you'll agree that a prompt, balanced decision benefits us both. What do you think?",Alice,1,
