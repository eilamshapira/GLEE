"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair initial offer, considering that future rounds will reduce the value due to inflation for me.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this division because it's reasonably fair while giving me a slight advantage as the first mover. If Bob rejects this offer, the 5% inflation penalty means the next round will be less valuable for me, so this is a good starting point that gives both of us a substantial portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

The original value for me would be $5,200, but with 5% inflation, I would actually receive $4,940 in real value.

Comparing my options:
1. Accept now: Get $4,940 in real value
2. Reject and make new offer next round: Any amount I get will be worth another 5% less, meaning I'd need to secure a significantly higher nominal amount to make up for the 10% total inflation loss.

Since this offer is fairly close to my initial proposal and rejecting would mean further value loss for me, I should accept.
