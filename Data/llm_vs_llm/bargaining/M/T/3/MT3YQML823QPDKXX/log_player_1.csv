"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll consider the inflation aspect carefully. Since I (Alice) lose 5% of the value each round while Bob loses 20%, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement sooner rather than later, especially for Bob.

For my first offer, I'll propose a balanced split that slightly favors me since I have more patience due to the lower inflation rate affecting me:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000}

I believe this is a fair first offer considering that waiting is more costly for Bob than for me due to the inflation difference. It gives Bob a substantial portion while recognizing my advantage in the negotiation structure."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if accepting a 50-50 split now is better than continuing to negotiate.

If I reject and propose in round 3, the money will be worth another 5% less to me and 20% less to Bob. Given Bob's higher inflation rate, I have leverage to potentially get a better deal in later rounds.

However, a 50-50 split is fair, and the $5000 I would receive now is worth more than potentially slightly more money later after inflation.
