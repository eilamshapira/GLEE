"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate if Alice's offer is fair and consider the game dynamics. 

Alice is offering me $4,000 (40%) and keeping $6,000 (60%) for herself. If I reject and continue to the next round, I'll face 5% inflation on my portion, while Alice faces 10% inflation. This gives me a slight advantage in later rounds, but we both lose value with each round.

Since I can make a counter-offer in the next round and the inflation rate is higher for Alice, I think I can propose a more favorable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more balanced while taking into account our different inflation rates.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I propose a fair 50-50 split of the money. This gives us each $5,000, which is equitable and reasonable. Given that inflation affects Alice more severely (10% vs my 5%), a fair split now would benefit both of us rather than continuing to negotiate through multiple rounds where we both lose value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer in the context of inflation.

Alice is now offering me $4,200 (42%) and keeping $5,800 (58%) for herself. This is a slight improvement from her initial offer of $4,000.

After 2 rounds of inflation:
- My portion faces 9.75% inflation, so $4,200 is worth about $3,790 in original value
- Alice's portion faces 19% inflation, so her $5,800 is worth about $4,698 in original value

If I reject, we'll move to round 4 where I can make a counter-offer, but with even more inflation. I notice Alice has moved toward a more equitable split, but we're still losing overall value with each round of negotiation.

I think I can still get a better offer by making another proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to make a strategic offer that Alice is likely to accept, considering the growing inflation that's affecting both of us (but her more severely).

{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200}

I'm proposing a more balanced split where I get $4,800 and Alice gets $5,200. This is better for Alice than a 50-50 split, while still being significantly better for me than her previous offer. Since we're already in round 4, the inflation is becoming a serious concern for both of us - especially for Alice with her higher 10% rate. This offer aims to find a middle ground that's mutually beneficial rather than continuing to lose value with further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's latest offer considering the increasing inflation.

Alice is now offering me $4,500 (45%) and keeping $5,500 (55%) for herself. This is an improvement from her previous offers.

After 4 rounds of inflation:
- My portion faces 18.55% inflation, so $4,500 is worth about $3,665 in original value
- Alice's portion faces 34.39% inflation, so her $5,500 is worth about $3,609 in original value

The inflation is significantly affecting both of us now, with Alice's portion being hit harder. Her actual value after inflation is now lower than mine despite the nominal amount being higher.

If we continue to the next round, we'll lose even more value. Alice has moved considerably from her initial position, and at this point, the inflation is becoming the bigger enemy for both of us.
