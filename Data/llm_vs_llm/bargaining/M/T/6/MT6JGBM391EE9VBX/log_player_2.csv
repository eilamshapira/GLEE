"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose to divide the money with 60% for me and 40% for you. This way, we both get a significant amount, and it's a fair start considering the inflation risk for me. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to take a bit less than my initial offer, but still more than a 50/50 split to account for the inflation risk I'm facing. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is undervaluing the impact of inflation on her end. While she's acknowledging it, a 55/45 split in her favor is still too skewed considering the potential decrease in value she's facing. By rejecting this offer, I aim to push for a more equitable split in the next round, taking advantage of the increasing pressure from inflation on her potential gains."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, inflation is clearly a factor.  I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor to reflect the decreasing value of the money over time. This is a fair compromise considering the circumstances."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

By round 4, the pressure of inflation is mounting for Alice. My offer of 55/45 in my favor directly mirrors her previous offer and highlights the impact of her delayed decision. It's a firm but justifiable stance given the game's dynamics."
