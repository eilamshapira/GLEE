Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but the inflation difference is significant. This split reflects our relative losses better, and hopefully, we can agree before the money loses too much value. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
