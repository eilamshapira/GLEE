"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share, let's agree 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Alice's offer of a 40-60 split in her favor. Since this is only the first round, I need to weigh whether making a counter-offer would be beneficial.

If I reject and we move to round 2, the total value will decrease (10% less valuable to me, 20% less valuable to Alice). This means the $100 would be worth $90 to me and $80 to Alice in the next round.

I could potentially propose a more favorable split for myself in the next round, but there's also the risk that Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to further depreciation of the money's value.

Given that a 40-60 split isn't terribly unfavorable and considering the inflation penalty for continuing, I'll respond:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
