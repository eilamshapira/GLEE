"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a division that considers both our interests, knowing that delays hurt both of us but affect Bob more severely.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this 60-40 split because:
1. It's a fair offer that gives Bob a substantial portion
2. If Bob rejects, in the next round the money will be worth 5% less for me and 10% less for him, so accepting now is in his best interest
3. This split acknowledges that I have the first-mover advantage while still being reasonable enough to likely secure acceptance"
