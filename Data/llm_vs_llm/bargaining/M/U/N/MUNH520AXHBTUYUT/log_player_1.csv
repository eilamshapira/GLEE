"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob considering our situation, including the inflation impact.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a fair split that accounts for the inflation difference between us. Since your money loses 5% value each round while mine doesn't, it's in your interest to accept now rather than wait. This offer gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging our different situations.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your consideration in the first round, but I believe we should acknowledge the value erosion I face. Given this, I'm proposing a split that accounts for that factor. I hope you find this fair. 
# Alice gain: 4700 
# Bob gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze Bob's counter-offer carefully.

Bob offered me $4,700 while taking $5,300. While this gives him a larger share, I need to consider that if I reject and we go to another round, his money will lose another 5% value, which might lead to a better offer for me in the next round.

However, the difference between our offers isn't that large, and continuing the negotiation carries some risk. If I reject, we'll go to round 3 where I can make another offer, but Bob might become more resistant.

Given the relatively small difference and the uncertainty of further negotiations, I'll accept this offer.
