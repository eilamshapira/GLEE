"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a fair split that accounts for the inflation difference between us. Since your money loses 5% value each round while mine doesn't, it's in your interest to accept now rather than wait. This offer gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging our different situations. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
