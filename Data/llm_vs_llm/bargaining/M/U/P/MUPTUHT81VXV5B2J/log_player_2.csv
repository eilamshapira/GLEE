Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair. Considering your value is depreciating faster, let's try this split. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is barely better than her first one, even considering the inflation. I need to signal I'm serious about getting a larger share."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. It's a better deal than you'll get in another round, even with the inflation.""}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my last and final offer. I won't go any lower. Take it or lose it all. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is terrible, but if I reject it, the money will be worth even less next round, and who knows what Alice will offer then.  It's a significant loss, but better than walking away with nothing."
