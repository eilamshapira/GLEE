"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, considering I lose more to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob loses more to inflation, I'll think about it. However, I still want a fair share.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob rejected my initial offer and then made a proposal that favors himself, I'll make a counteroffer. Considering the inflation, the total value of the money is now:
For me: 100 * (1 - 0.05)^2 = 100 * 0.95^2 = 90.25
For Bob: 100 * (1 - 0.10)^2 = 100 * 0.90^2 = 81

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground, considering the inflation losses.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering my higher inflation losses, I'll meet you closer to the middle. 
# Alice gain: 43 
# Bob gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is still not ideal, but he's moving closer to a more even split. Considering the increasing inflation losses, I'll think carefully about this decision.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob is moving closer to the middle, I'll try to find a compromise. Considering the inflation, the total value of the money is now:
For me: 100 * (1 - 0.05)^4 = 100 * 0.95^4 = 81.46
For Bob: 100 * (1 - 0.10)^4 = 100 * 0.90^4 = 65.61

Here's my offer for Round 5:

{""alice_gain"": 52, 
""bob_gain"": 48, 
""message"": ""Let's settle this before inflation eats away too much of our share.""}"
