"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair and split it evenly, 50-50. What do you say, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer of an even 50-50 split. Since this is the first round, accepting would give me $50. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the money will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation, so any amount would effectively be worth less.

A 50-50 split is fair, and given the inflation penalty for waiting, accepting now seems like the rational choice.
