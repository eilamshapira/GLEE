60.0,40.0,I propose we split the money with me getting $60 and you getting $40. This seems like a fair offer considering the impact of inflation on your gains in future rounds.,Alice,1,

55.0,45.0,"Let's meet in the middle. I'll take $55 and you take $45. This way, we both get a fair share considering the inflation impact on your side.",Alice,3,
