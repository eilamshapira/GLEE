"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position in the previous round, but I believe a more equitable split is for me to receive $60 and you receive $40.  Given the inflation disadvantage I'm facing, this split makes the most sense for me to agree to. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
