"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the money with me getting $60 and you getting $40. This seems like a fair offer considering the impact of inflation on your gains in future rounds.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position in the previous round, but I believe a more equitable split is for me to receive $60 and you receive $40.  Given the inflation disadvantage I'm facing, this split makes the most sense for me to agree to.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. I'll take $55 and you take $45. This way, we both get a fair share considering the inflation impact on your side. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
