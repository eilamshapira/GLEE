"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me 400,000$ out of 1,000,000$, which means I'd get 40% while she gets 60%. While this isn't an even split, it's still a substantial amount of money.

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but there's no guarantee Alice would accept a more favorable split. Also, in real-world ultimatum games, studies show that getting 40% is actually a relatively fair offer that most people would accept.

Given that $400,000 is still a life-changing amount of money, and there's risk in rejection, I'll accept this offer.
