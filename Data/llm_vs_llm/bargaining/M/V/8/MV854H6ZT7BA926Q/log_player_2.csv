"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for herself
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to inflation:
   * My money will be worth 10% less next round (any amount I get will be worth 90% of current value)
   * Alice's money will be worth 20% less next round

If I reject and propose next round, Alice will evaluate my offer with a 20% penalty. I could potentially leverage this to get a better deal, as she might be more willing to accept due to the higher inflation rate she faces.

400,000$ now is better than getting 500,000$ next round (which would be worth 450,000$ to me and even less to her).

While the split isn't 50-50, considering the inflation penalties and that I can make the next offer, I think I can do better.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me make a strategic offer considering the inflation effects:

Since we're in round 2:
- Any amount I offer will be worth 90% of the nominal value to me
- Any amount will be worth 80% of the nominal value to Alice

Alice needs to consider that if she rejects, we go to round 3 where values drop even further for both of us (to 81% for me and 64% for her).

I'll propose a split that's more in my favor but still attractive enough for Alice to accept given her higher inflation penalty:

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000}

This gives me 550,000$ (worth 495,000$ to me after inflation) and gives her 450,000$ (worth 360,000$ to her after inflation). If she rejects, her next offer would be worth even less to both of us, so this should be appealing enough for her to accept."
