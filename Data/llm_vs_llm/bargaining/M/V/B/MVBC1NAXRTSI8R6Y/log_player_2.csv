"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. 

Alice is offering a 50-50 split of the $1,000,000, which would give each of us $500,000. However, I should take into account the inflation aspect of the game. The money doesn't lose value for me in future rounds, but it loses 5% value for Alice with each round.

If I reject this offer and make a counter-offer in the next round, Alice would value the total money at only 950,000 (a 5% reduction). This gives me some negotiating leverage.

Given this information, I believe I can propose a more favorable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer that takes into account the 5% devaluation for Alice in this round while still being reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering you $450,000, which is worth more to you now than waiting another round when it would be worth 5% less to you. This split acknowledges the time value differential between us while still giving you a substantial portion of the money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's new offer carefully.

Alice is now offering me $480,000 while taking $520,000 for herself. Since we're now in round 3, Alice's money has lost 9.75% of its value compared to round 1, but mine hasn't lost any value.

If I reject this offer and we move to round 4, Alice's money would lose even more value (about 14.25% from the original value). This gives me increasing leverage as rounds progress.

Given that my previous offer was for me to get $550,000, and Alice is now offering me $480,000, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer that recognizes the continued inflation effect for Alice while moving toward a reasonable compromise.

{""bob_gain"": 575000, ""alice_gain"": 425000}

I'm offering you $425,000, which is still substantial but reflects the reality that we're now in round 4, where your money is worth 14.25% less than in round 1. Taking this deal now is better for you than continuing to future rounds with even greater devaluation. This offer provides a fair balance considering our different time-value situations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 520000 
# Alice gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's new offer.

Alice is now offering me $520,000 while taking $480,000. We're in round 5, where Alice's money has lost 18.55% of its value compared to round 1, while mine hasn't lost any value.

This offer represents a significant improvement from Alice's previous offer of $480,000 to me. If I reject and we move to round 6, Alice's money would lose about 22.6% of its original value, giving me even more leverage.

However, Alice's current offer of $520,000 to me is getting closer to my previous proposal of $575,000. The difference is now smaller, and continuing to negotiate carries the risk of reaching an impasse.

Given the reasonable improvement in Alice's offer and the progress toward a mutually acceptable split, I'll accept this offer.
