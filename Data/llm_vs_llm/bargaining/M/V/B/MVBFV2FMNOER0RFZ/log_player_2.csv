"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if this offer is fair given the game dynamics. Alice is offering me $40 while taking $60 for herself. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer, but the total money will be worth 20% less (so only $80 total for the next round).

While the split isn't equal, getting $40 now is better than potentially ending up with less through continued negotiation or nothing if we can't agree within 12 rounds. Given the inflation penalty, it's often better to accept reasonable early offers.
