"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for round 2, keeping in mind the 5% inflation:

Since the money is worth 5% less to me, the $100 is now worth $95 to me.  I'll aim for a somewhat equitable split, but I need to get more than Alice offered initially.

  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""alice_gain"": 55
