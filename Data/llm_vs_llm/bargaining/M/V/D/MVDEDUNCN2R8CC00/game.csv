4000.0,6000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer for an even split, but I believe my contributions to our project warrant a slightly larger share. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This still leaves you with a significant sum, and we can avoid further losses due to inflation by settling now.",Bob,2,

4500.0,5500.0,"Bob, I understand you're looking for more than an equal split, but a 60/40 split is too unbalanced. I'm offering you $5500 (55%) which is a fair compromise that recognizes your contributions while still being reasonable to me. With inflation affecting me each round, this is a sensible deal for both of us to accept now before further value is lost.",Alice,3,
