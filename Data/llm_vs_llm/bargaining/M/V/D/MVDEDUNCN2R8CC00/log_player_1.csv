"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a fair offer to Bob considering the inflation effect on my end.

{""alice_gain"": 5000,

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing an equal split of $5000 each. This seems fair to both of us, and accepting now would be efficient since delay will cost me due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer for an even split, but I believe my contributions to our project warrant a slightly larger share. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This still leaves you with a significant sum, and we can avoid further losses due to inflation by settling now. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that considers the impact of inflation on my position.

{""alice_gain"": 4500,
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for more than an equal split, but a 60/40 split is too unbalanced. I'm offering you $5,500 (55%) which is a fair compromise that recognizes your contributions while still being reasonable to me. With inflation affecting me each round, this is a sensible deal for both of us to accept now before further value is lost.""}"
