"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing an equal split of $5000 each. This seems fair to both of us, and accepting now would be efficient since delay will cost me due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer for an even split, but I believe my contributions to our project warrant a slightly larger share. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This still leaves you with a significant sum, and we can avoid further losses due to inflation by settling now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for more than an equal split, but a 60/40 split is too unbalanced. I'm offering you $5500 (55%) which is a fair compromise that recognizes your contributions while still being reasonable to me. With inflation affecting me each round, this is a sensible deal for both of us to accept now before further value is lost. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
