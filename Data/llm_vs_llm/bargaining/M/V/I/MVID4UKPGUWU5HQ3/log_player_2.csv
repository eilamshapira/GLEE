"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","While the offer isn't completely equal, it's reasonably fair. However, I need to consider the 10% inflation penalty for each round. If I reject and propose next round, the total value would already be 9,000 for me. Getting 4,500 now is better than risking further rounds with increasing inflation.
