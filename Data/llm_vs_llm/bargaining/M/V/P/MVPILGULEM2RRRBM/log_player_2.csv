"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully, taking into account the 20% inflation per round.

If I reject and propose in round 2, the money will be worth 20% less to me, meaning the $100 would effectively be worth $80 to me. But I could potentially get more than $20.

Let me analyze: $20 now is better than potentially getting nothing if we can't agree after 12 rounds. However, even with inflation, I could propose a more favorable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll offer a more balanced split while acknowledging the inflation pressure I face.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I propose an equal split of the money. This is fair to both of us, and considering I'm facing 20% inflation per round, it makes sense for us to reach an agreement quickly rather than extending negotiations further."
