I propose a 90/10 split, keeping 900,000 for myself and giving Bob 100,000. This is a fair starting point that ensures a good return for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm adjusting my proposal to reflect the changing value of the money and the need to find a mutually agreeable solution.  I'm offering a 60/40 split, giving Bob 400,000."
