"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering we both need to reach an agreement quickly to avoid inflation losses.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose an equal split. This way, neither of us is advantaged or disadvantaged. It's fair and simple, and we can both walk away with a decent amount before inflation affects the value. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept now, I'll get $500,000, but due to 20% inflation, it's only worth $400,000 to me
2. If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount I get will be worth another 20% less
3. There's no guarantee Bob will accept my next offer, which could lead to even more inflation losses
4. My previous 60-40 offer was rejected, suggesting Bob is firm on getting a fair share

Given these factors, I should accept now to avoid further value loss from inflation.
