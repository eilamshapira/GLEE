"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split that takes into account potential future rounds and inflation. Since I know inflation will reduce my gains by 10% each round, I want to make a reasonable first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

This is a slightly favorable split for me but still quite fair for Bob. I'm offering him 45% of the total amount, which is a substantial sum that should be appealing enough to accept rather than risk future rounds where the total value decreases for both of us."
