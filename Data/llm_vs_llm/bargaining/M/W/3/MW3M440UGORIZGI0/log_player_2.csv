"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer. Alice is proposing that she gets $6,000 and I get $4,000 out of the $10,000.

If I reject and we go to the next round, the money would be worth 10% less to me, meaning the $10,000 would effectively be worth $9,000 to me. I could propose a different split, but Alice could still reject it.

Given that there's a value decay with each round (10% for me, 5% for Alice), making a counter-offer might not be in my best interest if Alice is likely to reject it.

$4,000 now is probably better than risking a worse outcome after the value decrease.
