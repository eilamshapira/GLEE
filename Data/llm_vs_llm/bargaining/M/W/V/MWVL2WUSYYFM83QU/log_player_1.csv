"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a reasonably generous offer to Bob, considering I want to avoid multiple rounds due to the 10% inflation penalty that affects my gains.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose to take 600,000$ and give Bob 400,000$. This is a fair 60-40 split that respects Bob's position while giving me a slight advantage as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $450,000 but with 10% inflation, meaning effectively $405,000
2. If I reject, we go to next round where:
   - I can make a new offer
   - But my share will be worth another 10% less (20% total)
   - The longer this goes, the worse it gets for me
3. Bob's offer is actually quite reasonable, giving me 45% of the total

Given the inflation pressure and the fact that this is a decent offer, I should accept.
