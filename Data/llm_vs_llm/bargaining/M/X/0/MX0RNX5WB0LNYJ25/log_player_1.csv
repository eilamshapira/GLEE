Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 98, ""bob_gain"": 2, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we settle now. I'll take $98 and you get $2. This might seem lean for you, but in a rational sense, any amount is better than risking a protracted game. What do you say?""}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose we settle now with an even split of $50 each. I believe this fair division avoids further delays and benefits us both.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
