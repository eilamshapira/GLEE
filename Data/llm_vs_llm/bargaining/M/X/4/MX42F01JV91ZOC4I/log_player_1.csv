"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer.  Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm willing to gamble that he's more averse to inflation than I am.  He might be willing to settle for a slightly less favorable deal in the next round to avoid the risk of further devaluation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, let's find a compromise. This offer is fair and avoids further losses from inflation for both of us."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to a middle ground to entice Bob. 
* **Inflation:** Highlighting the shared risk of inflation might push him to accept.
* **Avoiding Greed:**  I don't want to seem too greedy and risk Bob rejecting out of spite, leading to further devaluation."
