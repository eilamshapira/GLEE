"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 0, ""bob_gain"": 1000000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I know that with every extra round my share is worth 5% less while your money keeps full value – in effect, you hold all the bargaining power. To avoid further discounting losses on my end, I’m willing to let you have the full $1,000,000 if you accept this offer now. Let’s close the deal quickly!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your situation, but I think a fair split would be more reasonable. Let's both walk away with $500000 each. This way, you still get a significant amount even after the 5% discount. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
