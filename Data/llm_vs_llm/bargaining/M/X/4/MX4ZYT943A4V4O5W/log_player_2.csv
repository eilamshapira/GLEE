"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I know that with every extra round my share is worth 5% less while your money keeps full value – in effect, you hold all the bargaining power. To avoid further discounting losses on my end, I’m willing to let you have the full $1000000 if you accept this offer now. Let’s close the deal quickly! 
# Bob gain: 1000000 
# Alice gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your situation, but I think a fair split would be more reasonable. Let's both walk away with $500,000 each. This way, you still get a significant amount even after the 5% discount.""}"
