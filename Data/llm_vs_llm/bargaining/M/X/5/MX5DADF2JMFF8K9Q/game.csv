550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose a fair split where I get slightly more since I'm making the first offer and taking the initiative. This is a generous offer considering potential future inflation.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, a fairer split. I'm countering with a proposal where I get slightly more, considering the inflation will start affecting me from next round. Let's be reasonable.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
580000.0,420000.0,"Bob, considering I'll only get 95% of my share due to inflation, this split is actually more balanced than it appears. My effective gain would be around 551000$, which is quite fair. Let's not waste more time as inflation will hurt us both.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
470000.0,530000.0,"Alice, inflation is hurting us both. Let's aim for a close-to-even split to maximize our gains. This offer accounts for some of the inflation hitting me.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, with my 14.26% inflation penalty, I would effectively get only 514440$ from this offer. Time is running out, and further delays will hurt us both significantly. This is a fair deal considering our respective inflation rates.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
490000.0,510000.0,"Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Let's split this almost evenly. I'm losing value fast, and so are you. Take this deal or we'll both end up with nothing.",Bob,6,
