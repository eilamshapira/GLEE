"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a fair split where I get slightly more since I'm making the first offer and taking the initiative. This is a generous offer considering potential future inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, a fairer split. I'm countering with a proposal where I get slightly more, considering the inflation will start affecting me from next round. Let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer because with 5% inflation impact on my share, I would effectively get only 427,500$ (450,000 * 0.95). I can make a better counter-offer in the next round, even accounting for further inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Bob, considering I'll only get 95% of my share due to inflation, this split is actually more balanced than it appears. My effective gain would be around 551,000$, which is quite fair. Let's not waste more time as inflation will hurt us both.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, inflation is hurting us both. Let's aim for a close-to-even split to maximize our gains. This offer accounts for some of the inflation hitting me. 
# Alice gain: 470000 
# Bob gain: 530000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject because with 14.26% inflation, I would only effectively get $403,000 (470,000 * 0.8574). The inflation impact is becoming significant, but I believe I can still make a better counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Bob, with my 14.26% inflation penalty, I would effectively get only 514,440$ from this offer. Time is running out, and further delays will hurt us both significantly. This is a fair deal considering our respective inflation rates.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Let's split this almost evenly. I'm losing value fast, and so are you. Take this deal or we'll both end up with nothing. 
# Alice gain: 490000 
# Bob gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept because with 22.62% inflation, I would get $379,162 (490,000 * 0.7738), and if I reject, the next round would have even worse inflation. While not ideal, this is better than risking further devaluation or potentially getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
