"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""My turn, a bit more balanced""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's find a middle ground, considering the inflation 
# Bob gain: 5800 
# Alice gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, let's calculate the actual value:
Bob's gain: 5800 * 0.81 (1 - 0.19) = 4698
Alice's gain: 4200 * 0.64 (1 - 0.36) = 2688

Since the offer seems relatively fair and the inflation will only increase, I'll accept.
