Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a more equitable split where I get 55% and you get 45%. This is much fairer than your initial offer and accounts for the fact that I'm facing inflation penalties with each round. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
