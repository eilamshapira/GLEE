"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%, but we can adjust in the next rounds. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer.

Alice is proposing I receive 10% ($100,000) while she gets 90% ($900,000). That's quite an imbalanced split in her favor.

If I reject this and move to the next round, the money will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation. However, I'll get to make the next proposal, which gives me more control.

Given that this is a very uneven split and I'll have proposal power in the next round, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while acknowledging the inflation factor.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""I propose a more equitable split where I get 55% and you get 45%. This is much fairer than your initial offer and accounts for the fact that I'm facing inflation penalties with each round.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to give away more than 40%. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer carefully.

Alice is now offering me $400,000 (40%) while she takes $600,000 (60%). This is a significant improvement from her first offer of just 10% to me, showing she's willing to compromise.

Due to inflation, the value of the money to me is now worth 9.75% less than in the first round. This means the $400,000 is effectively worth about $361,000 to me in original value.

If I reject this offer:
- I'll face further inflation (likely another 5%)
- I'll get to make another proposal
- But this back-and-forth could continue with diminishing returns for me

Given that Alice has moved significantly in my direction and further delays will reduce the value of my earnings, I'll accept this offer.
