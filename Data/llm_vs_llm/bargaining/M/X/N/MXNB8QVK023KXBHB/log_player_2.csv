Alice's offer:

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to make this worthwhile for me.  This is a fair offer, considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This offer isn't ideal, but it's better than what I might get in future rounds with inflation eating into my share.  Alice is clearly prioritizing her gains, and it's unlikely she'll offer me anything significantly better."
