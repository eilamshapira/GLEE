1000.0,9000.0,"Hi Bob – I propose a split where I get $1000 and you get $9000. If you reject, you'll have the chance to propose in Round 2, but keep in mind that any delay will cost you 10% per round in value. This offer secures you the full value you’d otherwise expect next round, so it’s in both our best interests to agree now. What do you say?",Alice,1,
