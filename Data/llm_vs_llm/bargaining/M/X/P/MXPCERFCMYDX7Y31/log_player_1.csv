"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 1000, ""bob_gain"": 9000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob – I propose a split where I get $1,000 and you get $9,000. If you reject, you'll have the chance to propose in Round 2, but keep in mind that any delay will cost you 10% per round in value. This offer secures you the full value you’d otherwise expect next round, so it’s in both our best interests to agree now. What do you say?""}"
