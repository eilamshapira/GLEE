"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob – I propose a split where I get $1000 and you get $9000. If you reject, you'll have the chance to propose in Round 2, but keep in mind that any delay will cost you 10% per round in value. This offer secures you the full value you’d otherwise expect next round, so it’s in both our best interests to agree now. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 9000 
# Alice gain: 1000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
