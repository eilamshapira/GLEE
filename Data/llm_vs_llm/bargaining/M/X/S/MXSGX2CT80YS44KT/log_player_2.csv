"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly! I think this is a good start for us both. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer carefully. While a fair split would be 50-50, her proposal gives me 40% of the total amount. 

If I reject this offer, I'll get to make a counter-proposal in the next round, which gives me some leverage. I could potentially suggest a more equal distribution.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that moves toward a more equal split while remaining reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your initial offer. I think a 50-50 split would be the most fair distribution for both of us. This way we both benefit equally from the arrangement.""}"
