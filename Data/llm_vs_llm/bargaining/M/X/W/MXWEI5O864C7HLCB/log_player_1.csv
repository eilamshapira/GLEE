"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think a fair split is that we each get $5000. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage. Let's agree on this and finish the game. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
