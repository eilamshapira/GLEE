6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because if you reject, the money will be worth less to you in the next round due to inflation.",Alice,1,

3600.0,6400.0,"Alice, I'm proposing a more favorable split now that the money is worth less to me. Take it or leave it.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, let's be rational. Due to inflation, each round makes the money worth 20% less to you. I'm offering you $4500 now, which is worth more to you than a larger amount in future rounds. This is a fair split considering our different inflation rates.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, this is my final offer. I need a bigger share now due to inflation. Take it.",Bob,4,

5800.0,4200.0,"Bob, let's be practical. Your $4200 now is worth more to you than $6000 in the next round due to your 48.8% inflation. If we continue, you'll lose even more value. This split maximizes both our interests - let's end this now.",Alice,5,

4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, inflation is really hurting me now. I'm offering this split as a last resort. Accept, or we both get less.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"Bob, think about this carefully. Due to 67.23% inflation for you, getting $4000 now is worth more than getting $5500 or more in future rounds. If you reject this, you'll lose even more value due to inflation. This is actually the most rational choice for both of us at this point.",Alice,7,
