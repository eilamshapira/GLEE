"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because if you reject, the money will be worth less to you in the next round due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm proposing a more favorable split now that the money is worth less to me. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 3600 
# Bob gain: 6400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The money is worth 20% less to Bob now, so his $6400 is actually worth only $5120 to him. He's trying to get more despite having less utility for it. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round that accounts for this declining value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Bob, let's be rational. Due to inflation, each round makes the money worth 20% less to you. I'm offering you $4500 now, which is worth more to you than a larger amount in future rounds. This is a fair split considering our different inflation rates.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. I need a bigger share now due to inflation. Take it. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The money is worth 48.8% less to Bob now, so his $6000 is only worth about $3072 to him in real value. Meanwhile, he's offering me $4000 which is less than my previous fair offers. I can make a better proposal in the next round that accounts for our different utility values."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, 
""bob_gain"": 4200, 
""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical. Your $4200 now is worth more to you than $6000 in the next round due to your 48.8% inflation. If we continue, you'll lose even more value. This split maximizes both our interests - let's end this now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, inflation is really hurting me now. I'm offering this split as a last resort. Accept, or we both get less. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The money is worth 67.23% less to Bob now, so his $5500 is only worth about $1802 to him in real value. This shows he's not being rational, as he's asking for more nominal dollars while getting less real value. I can still make a better offer in the next round that makes more economic sense for both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Bob, think about this carefully. Due to 67.23% inflation for you, getting $4000 now is worth more than getting $5500 or more in future rounds. If you reject this, you'll lose even more value due to inflation. This is actually the most rational choice for both of us at this point.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm offering a slightly better split. The value of the money is really hurting me now. Consider this carefully. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While Bob is still asking for a larger nominal amount ($5200), due to the 79.03% inflation for him, his share is only worth about $1090 in real value to him. Meanwhile, I get $4800 at full value. If I reject, we risk getting nothing in 4 rounds, and my potential gains from future negotiations don't outweigh this risk. This is actually a good deal for me at this point."
