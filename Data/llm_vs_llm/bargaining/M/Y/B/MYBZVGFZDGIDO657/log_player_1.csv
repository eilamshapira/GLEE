"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering future inflation will hit you harder than me.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it equally. Even with inflation, this is a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $5000 × 0.9 = $4500 in round 1 value
- If I reject and propose 6000/4000 next round:
  * My gain would be $6000 × 0.8 = $4800 in round 1 value
  * But Bob might reject again, leading to even worse outcomes
- A 50-50 split is a common fair solution
- Further negotiations might lead to mutual losses due to inflation
