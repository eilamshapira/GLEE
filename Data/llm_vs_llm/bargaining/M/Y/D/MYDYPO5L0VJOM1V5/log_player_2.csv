Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for considering a compromise, Bob. I'm proposing $475k for me and $525k for you. This is closer to the middle and should account for both our considerations, especially as inflation affects our gains. Letâ€™s seal this deal now! 
# Bob gain: 525000 
# Alice gain: 475000
