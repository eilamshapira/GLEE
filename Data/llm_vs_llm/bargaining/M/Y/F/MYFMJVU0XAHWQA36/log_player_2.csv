"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. Take this generous offer and we both win big! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is proposing that I get $400,000 while she gets $600,000. This is a 40%-60% split in her favor.

If I reject this offer, I'll make the next proposal, but the total amount will decrease by 20% to $800,000. This means that even if I proposed a fair 50-50 split in the next round, I would get $400,000 - exactly what Alice is offering me now.

Since rejecting won't increase my payout (and could decrease it if Alice rejects my subsequent offer), it makes rational sense to accept this offer.
