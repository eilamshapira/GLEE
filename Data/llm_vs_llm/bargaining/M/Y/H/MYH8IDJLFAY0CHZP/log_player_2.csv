"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a fair split that acknowledges our different time pressures. Since you face higher depreciation (10% vs my 5%), accepting now benefits both of us more than extending negotiations. This split gives you a substantial portion while respecting both our interests. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
