"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $40, and she gets $60. 

Given that inflation affects Alice (money is worth 5% less to her each round) but doesn't affect me (0% inflation for me), it might be strategic to reject this first offer and make my own proposal in the next round.

If I reject, Alice will face a 5% reduction in the value of money in the next round, which gives me some negotiating leverage. I can propose a more favorable split in round 2.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a more balanced offer that takes into account the inflation affecting Alice. Since the money is worth 5% less to Alice in this round, I'll propose a split that's more favorable to me than her initial offer, but still reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I suggest this split because it's more equitable than the initial 40/60 division. Since Alice is facing inflation on her end (the money is already worth 5% less to her this round), she should consider accepting this offer rather than prolonging the negotiation and losing more value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's new offer carefully. She's now offering me $45, which is an improvement from her initial $40 offer.

At this point, inflation has reduced the value of Alice's money by 9.75% compared to round 1. If I reject this offer, in the next round that inflation will increase to about 14.26% for her, while my value remains the same.

Alice has moved her offer by $5 in my favor from her initial position. Her rejection of my 55/45 split shows she's not willing to go below $50 for herself yet. Given the inflation pressure on her side and the fact we have a limited number of rounds, this offer of $45 represents meaningful progress.

However, I believe there's still room for a better deal. Since inflation doesn't affect me, but continues to erode Alice's value, I'll reject this offer to seek a more favorable split in round 4.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that Alice rejected my previous offer of 55/45 and countered with 45/55, I can see she's trying to meet in the middle. The money is now worth 14.26% less to Alice if we move to the next round, which gives me increasing leverage. I should make an offer that's a bit better for me than her latest proposal, but not so aggressive that she automatically rejects it.

{""bob_gain"": 53, ""alice_gain"": 47}

This offer is slightly better for me than Alice's last proposal, but provides Alice with a reasonable amount given the inflation pressure she's facing. The longer we negotiate, the more value she loses, so accepting this now is in her interest rather than facing even greater depreciation in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has now offered a 50/50 split, which is a fair and equitable division. She's moved from her initial 40/60 offer to an even split, showing significant compromise.

At this point, inflation has reduced the value of Alice's money by 18.55% compared to round 1. If we continue to the next round, her inflation would increase further to nearly 23% while my value remains unchanged.

Given that:
1. Alice has moved to a completely fair 50/50 split
2. We've already gone through 5 rounds, with 7 remaining
3. The increasing inflation pressure on Alice's side
4. The risk of getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement within 12 rounds

This is a reasonable offer that gives me half of the total amount, which is a standard fair division.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
