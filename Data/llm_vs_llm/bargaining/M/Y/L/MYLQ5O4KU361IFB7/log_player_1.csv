"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a division that considers both our interests, knowing that Bob's money loses 5% value each round while mine doesn't.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose you get $40 and I get $60. This is a fair offer considering future rounds will be less valuable for you due to the 5% inflation penalty."
