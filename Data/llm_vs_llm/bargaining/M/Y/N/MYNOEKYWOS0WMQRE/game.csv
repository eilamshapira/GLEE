450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I propose $550K for me and $450K for you. Given the uncertain inflation effects on your share and our need to settle efficiently, this offer represents a fair compromise. Let's finalize the deal now before further delays affect our outcomes.",Bob,2,

505000.0,495000.0,"Alice, with your share losing 19% value each round, delaying further only worsens your position. While you previously proposed a 50/50 split (effectively $405K for you), I'm now offering you $505K nominal, which amounts to roughly $409K in today’s value—an improvement. Let's finalize the deal now to avoid further depreciation on your end.",Bob,4,

,,"Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm holding out for a division that better rewards the value of my share—since my amount doesn't lose any real value with time while yours does. I believe we can reach a deal that gives me a higher nominal share without affecting me, so I'll have to reject this offer.",Bob,5,reject
435000.0,565000.0,"Alice, I understand your urgency as further delay only erodes your share's value more (now at a 34.39% discount compared to the first round). To help you secure a better effective amount than your own last proposal, I'm offering a division of $565K for me and a nominal $435K for you — which translates to roughly $285K in current value. This offer improves on your previous terms and avoids any additional losses for you. Let's settle now before the situation worsens.",Bob,6,
