"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $600,000 and giving Bob $400,000, with a message suggesting that this is a fair starting point. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose $550K for me and $450K for you. Given the uncertain inflation effects on your share and our need to settle efficiently, this offer represents a fair compromise. Let's finalize the deal now before further delays affect our outcomes. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, the $450,000 offered by Bob is actually worth $405,000 to me (90% of $450,000).

Considering this, I think I can do better. Bob's offer doesn't seem particularly generous, and I'm not convinced that his compromise is fair.

My response:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less in each round, I need to act quickly to maximize my share.

In Round 1, the money was worth 100% of its value.
In Round 2, the money was worth 90% of its value to me.
In Round 3, the money is worth 81% of its value to me (90% * 90%).

With this in mind, I'll make a more generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can finalize the deal.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair deal considering the inflation!""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $1,000,000 evenly, 50/50, and hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise given the decreasing value of my share due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, with your share losing 19% value each round, delaying further only worsens your position. While you previously proposed a 50/50 split (effectively $405K for you), I'm now offering you $505K nominal, which amounts to roughly $409K in today’s value—an improvement. Let's finalize the deal now to avoid further depreciation on your end. 
# Alice gain: 505000 
# Bob gain: 495000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of Bob's offer to me, considering the inflation.

Since the money I gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, and Bob mentions that my share loses 19% value each round (which I assume is an approximation), I'll calculate the value as follows:

In Round 1, the money was worth 100% of its value.
In Round 2, the money was worth 90% of its value to me.
In Round 3, the money was worth 81% of its value to me (90% * 90%).
In Round 4, the money is worth approximately 72.9% of its value to me (81% * 90%, using the 19% depreciation rate mentioned by Bob, but I was given 27.1% less, so) (100% * (0.9^3)) = 72.9%, however I was given the 27.1% figure, so I will use that to calculate: 
100% - 27.1% = 72.9%.

The $505,000 offered by Bob is actually worth $505,000 * 0.729 = $368,145 to me.

Bob's offer is not as generous as he claims, considering the actual value of the money to me. However, I should also consider that further delays will only decrease the value of my share.

My response:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less in each round, and I've already lost 27.1% of its value, I need to make a strategic decision.

In Round 5, the money I gain is worth approximately 10% less than in Round 4, which was already 27.1% less than the original value.

Let's calculate the value:
100% - 27.1% = 72.9%
72.9% * 0.9 = 65.61%

So, the money I gain in Round 5 is worth approximately 65.61% of its original value.

Considering this, I'll make a more aggressive offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can finalize the deal.

Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Last chance, let's settle before further inflation hurts me more!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share, $580,000, and taking $420,000 for myself, which is worth approximately $420,000 * 0.6561 = $275,565 to me. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your urgency as further delay only erodes your share's value more (now at a 34.39% discount compared to the first round). To help you secure a better effective amount than your own last proposal, I'm offering a division of $565K for me and a nominal $435K for you — which translates to roughly $285K in current value. This offer improves on your previous terms and avoids any additional losses for you. Let's settle now before the situation worsens. 
# Alice gain: 435000 
# Bob gain: 565000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of Bob's offer to me, considering the inflation.

Since the money I gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round, the $435,000 offered by Bob is actually worth:
$435,000 * (1 - 0.4095) = $435,000 * 0.5905 = $256,717.50 to me.

Bob's offer is not as generous as he claims, considering the actual value of the money to me. He mentions that this offer improves on my previous terms, but I need to consider the current value of the offer.

My previous offer to Bob was $420,000 for me, which would be worth approximately $420,000 * 0.6561 = $275,565 to me in Round 5. However, the value of money to me has decreased since then.

Considering the current offer from Bob, I think it's time to accept, as further delays will only decrease the value of my share.
