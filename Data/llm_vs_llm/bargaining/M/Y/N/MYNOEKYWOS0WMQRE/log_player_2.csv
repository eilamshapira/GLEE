I believe we can reach a deal that gives me a higher nominal share without affecting me, so I'll have to reject this offer.""}"

To help you secure a better effective amount than your own last proposal, I'm offering a division of $565K for me and a nominal $435K for you — which translates to roughly $285K in current value. This offer improves on your previous terms and avoids any additional losses for you. Let's settle now before the situation worsens.""}"
