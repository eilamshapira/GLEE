Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I believe a 50-50 split is more fair. Since you face higher inflation (10% vs my 5%), accepting this equal split now would be beneficial for both of us rather than extending negotiations. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
