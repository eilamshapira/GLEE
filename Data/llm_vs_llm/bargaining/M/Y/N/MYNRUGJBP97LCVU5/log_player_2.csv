"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Let's split this fairly. I think this is a good start, what do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. This is the first round, so no inflation has occurred yet
2. Alice is offering me 4000$ and taking 6000$ for herself
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but:
   - My money will be worth 5% less (can get maximum 9500$ value)
   - Her money will be worth 10% less
4. The split isn't equal (60-40 in her favor)
5. Given the higher inflation rate for Alice, I have some leverage in negotiations

I'll reject this offer since it's not favorable enough, and I can make a counter-proposal next round. The inflation pressure affects Alice more than me, so she should be more willing to negotiate.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split, considering that Alice faces higher inflation pressure than I do:

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I believe a 50-50 split is more fair. Since you face higher inflation (10% vs my 5%), accepting this equal split now would be beneficial for both of us rather than extending negotiations.""}

This is a strategic offer because:
1. It's a fair 50-50 split that's hard to argue against
2. I'm highlighting the inflation pressure she faces
3. It's better for her to accept now than risk further rounds where her money loses more value
4. If she rejects, she'll make a counter-offer with her money worth 10% less, while mine only 5% less"
