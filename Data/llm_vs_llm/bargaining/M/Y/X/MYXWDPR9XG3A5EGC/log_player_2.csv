"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. It's a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
2. But if I reject, I can make my own offer next round
3. Due to inflation, the $50 would be worth $45 for me next round (10% less)
4. For Alice, her $50 would be worth $47.50 next round (5% less)
5. This means Alice has less inflation pressure than me, but we both lose value by waiting

Given that:
- This is a fair initial offer
- I lose more value than Alice by waiting
- We have limited rounds and need to reach agreement
- There's risk in rejection as Alice might counter with a worse offer
