"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000
2. This is a 40-60 split, which is not exactly fair
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
4. However, due to 5% inflation, my money will be worth less next round
5. $4,000 now is better than $4,000 * 0.95 = $3,800 next round
6. Still, I think I can get a better deal

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a strategic offer:
1. The money is now worth 5% less to me
2. I should aim for a better split than 40-60
3. A 50-50 split would be fair, but I need to account for inflation
4. I'll propose slightly more in my favor to compensate for the 5% loss

{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""I propose a more balanced split, slightly in my favor to offset my inflation costs""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle, considering inflation 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Alice has increased her offer from $4,000 to $4,200
2. My inflation penalty is now 9.75%, so $4,200 is worth $3,790.50 in round 1 terms
3. Alice seems to be experiencing higher inflation (19%)
4. Her $5,800 is worth less to her than before
5. If I reject, the next round will have even higher inflation penalties
6. Given the increasing inflation and that Alice is showing willingness to negotiate up, this offer is reasonable
