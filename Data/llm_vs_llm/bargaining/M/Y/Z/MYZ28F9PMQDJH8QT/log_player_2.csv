"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split, let's end this quickly before inflation hurts us both 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Alice's offer of a 60-40 split, where I would receive $400,000 and she would get $600,000.

Let me think about this. With 5% inflation per round affecting my money, waiting comes at a cost. If I reject and counter-offer in round 2, my maximum potential gain would already be reduced by 5%.

While a 50-50 split might seem more equal, the inflation penalty makes an immediate 40% more valuable than risking further rounds. Alice's point about ending quickly before inflation hurts us both is valid.
