"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's initial offer carefully. She's proposing I take $400,000 while she gets $600,000. While this isn't an equal split, it's still a substantial amount. If I reject and we go to the next round, the total pot will be worth 10% less (so $900,000 total).

In the next round, I could propose a more favorable split, but Alice might reject, leading to further depreciation. Since I have a reasonably good offer now with guaranteed $400,000, and considering the risk of continued negotiations with inflation, I'll respond:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
