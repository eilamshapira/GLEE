"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I'm ready. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to evaluate Bob's offer, taking into account the inflation that affects me.

*   **My perspective (Alice):**

    *   In round 1, $1 was worth 1.
    *   Now, in round 2, my money is worth 5% less. So, I have to adjust Bob's offer.
    *   Bob offered me $4000, but because of inflation, it's worth 4000 \* (1 - 0.05) = 3800$ in real terms.

Given the information, I will do the following:

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 3, taking into account that this is a new round and the inflation has affected both of us.

I will also consider my previous decisions. I rejected the previous offer as the amount was not enough for me, and I need to consider the likelihood of Bob accepting any offer at this point.

Here's my offer:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze Bob's offer in Round 4, factoring in the accumulated inflation for both of us.

*   **My perspective (Alice):**
    *   My money is now worth 14.26% less than in Round 1.
    *   Bob is offering me $5000. However, this $5000 is only worth 5000 * (1 - 0.1426) = 4287$ in real terms.

Considering that I have rejected offers before and I am aware that the value of money is diminishing, I will compare the offered amount with my desired amount and decide whether to accept.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 5. I need to be more realistic about what I can get. The money is worth significantly less now. I also need to consider the possibility of Bob rejecting again, in which case we'll both get nothing.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alright, let's assess Bob's offer in Round 6, considering the cumulative inflation.

*   **My Perspective (Alice):**
    *   My money is now worth 22.62% less than in Round 1.
    *   Bob is offering me $6000. However, this $6000 is only worth 6000 \* (1 - 0.2262) = 4642.8$ in real terms.

I rejected lower offers before, but the situation is getting desperate due to the rapidly decreasing value of money. I think it's time to accept the offer.

```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```"
