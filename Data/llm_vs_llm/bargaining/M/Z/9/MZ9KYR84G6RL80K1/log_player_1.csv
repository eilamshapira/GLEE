Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the impact of inflation, I propose that I get $550K and you get $450K. This ensures that we both get a fair share while accounting for the decreasing value of the money over time. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000

At this stage, if we postpone, you'll eventually be forced to offer nearly everything to me in order to get my agreement, which would leave you with very little. To avoid further losses from inflation on your side, I'm offering you $20,000 now. I believe this is a better deal than risking even steeper discounts in future rounds. Let's settle this early and secure our respective shares.""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but I need to ensure I'm not severely disadvantaged by inflation. I propose I get $600K and you get $400K. This balances the risk and reward more equitably given the current round and inflation impact.

If you reject, you'll be proposing in round 8 where the devaluation is expected to be even steeper, likely reducing your effective gains below what I’m offering today. In this proposal, you’d receive $845,000 nominally, which—after the current inflation discount—secures you an effective value of roughly $500,000. I believe this is a fair compromise given our deteriorating options. Let’s lock this in now before the situation gets any tougher for you.""}"
