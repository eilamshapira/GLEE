Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the $1000000 equally, with $500K each. Accepting this offer now guarantees you the full amount before any potential inflation impacts your share in later rounds. I believe a fair and prompt agreement is best for both of us.

  ""alice_gain"": 450000,

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, given that every additional round further erodes the real value of the funds you receive, waiting will only hurt your bottom line. At this stage, if we postpone, you'll eventually be forced to offer nearly everything to me in order to get my agreement, which would leave you with very little. To avoid further losses from inflation on your side, I'm offering you $20000 now. I believe this is a better deal than risking even steeper discounts in future rounds. Let's settle this early and secure our respective shares. 
# Bob gain: 20000 
# Alice gain: 980000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I know you’re wary of inflation hurting your share even more in future rounds. Every round we delay, the real value of your money takes another hit. If you wait until round 6, the inflation impact will only worsen your outcome. In this round, I'm offering you a guaranteed $50000 – an amount that, although smaller in nominal terms compared to earlier rounds, is much more valuable than a devalued sum later. Accept this offer now, and we both walk away before further erosion occurs. 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I know the inflation hit on your share is already heavy at 40.95% less than its face value—and it will only worsen if we delay further. If you reject, you'll be proposing in round 8 where the devaluation is expected to be even steeper, likely reducing your effective gains below what I’m offering today. In this proposal, you’d receive $845000 nominally, which—after the current inflation discount—secures you an effective value of roughly $500000. I believe this is a fair compromise given our deteriorating options. Let’s lock this in now before the situation gets any tougher for you. 
# Bob gain: 845000 
# Alice gain: 155000
