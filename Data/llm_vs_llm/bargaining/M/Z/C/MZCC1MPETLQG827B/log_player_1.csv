"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make my initial offer to Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose that I receive $60 and Bob receives $40. This is a fair division that gives me a slightly larger share to offset the risk of inflation if we continue to later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $45 for me and $55 for him. While this gives me less than my initial proposal, due to the 20% inflation, rejecting and moving to another round would decrease the value of my potential earnings even further. $45 now is better than risking an even smaller amount in the next round after additional inflation."
