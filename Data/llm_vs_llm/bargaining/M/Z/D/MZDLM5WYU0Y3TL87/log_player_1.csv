"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split, but slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer and there's inflation risk.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and you get $45. This is a reasonable split that gives us both a good amount while accounting for my first-mover position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. If I accept Bob's offer now, I'll get $40 but it's worth 10% less due to inflation, so effectively $36. If I reject and make a counter-offer, any amount I get will be worth another 10% less in the next round. Plus, Bob might reject again, leading to further devaluation.

While this isn't as much as I hoped for, continuing the negotiation will only reduce the real value of what I can get due to inflation. It's better to secure $36 in real value now than risk getting less in future rounds.
