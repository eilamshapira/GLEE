"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposed a 40/60 split in her favor. Given that we're starting with $10,000 and the money loses 20% value each round, if I reject this offer, we'll be dividing $8,000 in the next round.

If I reject now, I could propose a more equal split in round 2, but the total pie will be smaller. Even if I proposed a 50/50 split next round, I'd get $4,000, which is the same as what I'm being offered now.
