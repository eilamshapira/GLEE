Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This reflects a fairer division considering the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000
