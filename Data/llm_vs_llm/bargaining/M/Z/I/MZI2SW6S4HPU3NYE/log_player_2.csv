Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal. I'll take 90% and you can have the remaining 10%. Hope you agree.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This reflects a fairer division considering the risk of inflation.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the money 60/40, with me taking 60% and you 40%. This is fair considering the inflation we've seen.  Let's end this game on a positive note. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

Alice's offer is now the same as what I offered in Round 2. Since the value of money is decreasing for her, and my proposed share remains the same, it's in my best interest to accept now before her offer potentially gets worse for me."
