6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering we both need to come to an agreement quickly, as delays will hurt my portion due to inflation.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
1.0,9999.0,"Alice, if you wait another round the inflation will cut your share by 20%, and I, fortunately, suffer no such loss. Accepting this offer now gives you a tiny positive amount, which is better than the spiraling loss you'll face later. Let's settle quickly.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
7500.0,2500.0,"Bob, I need to increase my portion to 75-25 to offset the 20% inflation loss I'm facing. Even with this split, I'm effectively getting less than my initial 60-40 offer due to inflation. This is still fair for you as your money doesn't lose value. Let's be reasonable and conclude this now.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
1.0,9999.0,"Alice, please consider the harsh reality of inflation. At this round, your $1 is worth only 51.2 cents compared to the initial round’s dollar. If you reject, you'll be the proposer in round 5 – but then you'll face an even steeper discount (your dollars will be worth only about 41 cents each) and I'll still have all the bargaining power. Accepting this offer now, however small, secures you a better outcome than waiting. Let's wrap this up.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
8500.0,1500.0,"Bob, I have to increase my nominal share to 85-15 just to offset the severe inflation penalty I'm facing. With the current 59.04% cumulative inflation loss, my effective gain would only be around $3484, which is far less than my initial fair offer. You're exploiting the inflation penalty, but continuing this game hurts us both. Let's end this reasonably now.",Alice,5,
,,"Alice, while I understand your inflation concerns, the division you're proposing gives me only $1500 with no inflation effect, while your share, after a 59.04% penalty, will only be worth roughly $3480. If we keep delaying, I'll be in the position to make an offer that minimizes your effective value even further. I believe it's not in my best interest to accept this offer. Let's continue to seek a more favorable equilibrium.",Bob,5,reject
1.0,9999.0,"Alice, this is our last chance before the inflation penalty deepens further. At this round your dollars are worth only 32.8 cents each, and if you reject, you'll have to propose in the next round where I can force you to accept a deal that leaves you effectively with nothing. Accept this small offer now to secure a positive value rather than risking a zero outcome.",Bob,6,
