"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I need to make an initial offer to Bob, keeping in mind the risk of inflation if we go to later rounds. I want to start with a fair offer that also incentivizes him to accept it now.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I see Bob has made a counteroffer. I need to consider the inflation and decide whether to accept or reject.

*   **My original offer:** $550,000 (worth 5% less now)
*   **Bob's offer:** $475,000 (worth 5% less now)

Let's calculate the current value of Bob's offer to me after 5% inflation: $475,000 * 0.95 = $451,250

While this is significantly less than my initial proposal of $550,000, and less than the inflated value of my original offer, $550,000 * 0.95 = $522,500, I need to consider the risk of further inflation. If I reject, the value decreases again. Plus, I don't know how much Bob's money decreased by.

Since this is only round 2, and I still have a chance to make a counteroffer next round, I will reject, hoping that I can get a better deal.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, it's my turn to propose again. Now I need to consider that the money is worth 10% less to me than in Round 1. I also need to factor in that Bob's money was worth 10% less to him than in round 1 in the previous round, and presumably worth 15% less this round. I need to make an offer that is tempting enough for him to accept, given the continued inflation. I'll try to be slightly more generous than my initial offer, while still prioritizing my gain.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 530000,
""bob_gain"": 470000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob has made another counteroffer. Let's analyze:

*   **Bob's offer:** $450,000
*   **Inflation impact on me:** 14.26% less than round 1. So Bob's offer is worth $450,000 * (1 - 0.1426) = $385,670 to me now.

This is significantly less than my original offer and less than what I'm willing to accept. I believe Bob is being unreasonable, especially considering that his money has inflated more than mine. I will reject.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, it's my turn to make an offer again. The inflation is definitely starting to bite. At this point, I'm estimating that I will lose about 5% per round. I need to make an offer that's attractive to Bob, considering his steeper losses, but also ensures I get a decent amount. I'll sweeten the deal a little for him, but still aim to get the majority.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 510000,
""bob_gain"": 490000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alright, Bob is really pushing for a larger share. Let's break this down:

*   **Bob's Offer:** $420,000
*   **Inflation for Alice:** 22.62% less than Round 1.
*   **Current Value of Bob's Offer to Me:** $420,000 * (1 - 0.2262) = $324,000 (approximately)

This is a very low amount, especially given that Bob's money has inflated even more. I think Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation. I will reject this offer.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, the inflation is really becoming a problem. We're halfway through the rounds, and I'm getting worried we'll end up with nothing. I need to be more conciliatory, but I also need to ensure I get a worthwhile amount. I'll make a more generous offer, hoping Bob will accept it this time, considering his much higher inflation rate.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 490000,
""bob_gain"": 510000
}
```"
