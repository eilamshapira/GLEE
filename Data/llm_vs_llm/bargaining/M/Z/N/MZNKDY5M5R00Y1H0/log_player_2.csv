"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, how about a 45/55 split? It leaves you with a little more while being fair to both of us. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation carefully.

Alice is offering me 5500$ (55%) and taking 4500$ (45%) for herself. This is actually a better split for me than an even 50/50 division.

I need to consider whether I should accept this offer or reject it and make a counter-offer next round. Since Alice faces a 10% inflation penalty per round, while I face no inflation penalty, I have a strategic advantage by waiting. If we go to the next round, Alice's money will be worth 10% less to her.

However, this initial offer already favors me, and there's always risk in negotiation. Alice has offered me more than half of the money right away, which is reasonable.
