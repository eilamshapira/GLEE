"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think through this strategically. 

Alice has offered a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance. However, I need to consider that:
1. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the money will be worth 10% less for me
2. I don't know how inflation affects Alice
3. We have 12 rounds maximum before we both get nothing

A 50-50 split in the first round means I get $50 at full value. If I reject, the best I could hope for in the next round would be a larger share of money that's worth 10% less to me.

Given these factors, this is actually a pretty good offer. A fair split with no inflation penalty is better than risking a worse outcome in later rounds.
