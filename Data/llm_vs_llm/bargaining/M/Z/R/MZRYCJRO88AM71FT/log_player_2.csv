"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair distribution. I believe this is a good starting point for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $4000 out of $10000 (40%)
2. If I reject, in the next round:
   - I can make a counter-offer
   - But the money will be worth 20% less to me
   - $10000 will effectively be worth $8000 for me
3. This means $4000 now is better than any amount above $4800 in the next round
4. Given that Alice opened with a somewhat uneven split in her favor, I should probably negotiate

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced counter-offer, considering that time pressure affects me:

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. This is equitable for both of us, and we can avoid further devaluation of the money through inflation.""}

The reasoning for this offer:
1. A 50-50 split is fair and commonly accepted in negotiation
2. I'm affected by 20% inflation per round, so I want to reach an agreement soon
3. My rejected $4000 would be worth more than $5000 in future rounds due to inflation
4. This offer shows I'm reasonable but also expect fair treatment
5. The even split makes it psychologically easier for Alice to accept"
