"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer. I'm getting $40 out of $100, which is less than half. If I reject and move to the next round, the total value will decrease by 10% for me, so the pot is effectively worth $90 to me. However, I'll get to make the next offer.

Given that we have 12 rounds and inflation reduces the money's value by 10% each round for me, I should consider whether I can get a better deal that outweighs the inflation cost.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair offer that acknowledges the inflation factor and tries to find a reasonable middle ground.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'm offering a slightly higher amount for myself since I know I'm affected by the 10% inflation per round. This is a fair split that gives me a bit more to compensate for my time pressure, while still giving Alice a substantial portion. I hope Alice understands that due to my inflation penalty, I need to secure a better deal now rather than later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Alice has offered me $45 now, which is more than her initial offer. I also notice that we now know Alice is affected by inflation too - she's actually facing a higher inflation rate than I am (36% vs. 19% by round 3).

Given this new information, Alice's offer of $45 to me seems reasonable. Due to the inflation effect, if we continue to delay, both of us will lose value. The money is now worth 19% less to me, so $45 now is like getting about $36.45 of the original value. If I reject and we continue to later rounds, we'll both lose even more to inflation.
