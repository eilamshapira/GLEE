"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take 60%, you take 40%. This way we both walk away with a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $400,000 (40%) vs. her $600,000 (60%)
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 5% less for me in the next round
3. In the next round, I could propose a different split, but:
   - The maximum I could get would be effectively reduced by 5%
   - Alice might reject my offer, leading to further rounds and more value loss

While 40/60 isn't an even split, accepting now guarantees me $400,000. If I reject and we go another round, even if I managed to get 50%, the 5% inflation would mean I'd only effectively get $475,000 * 0.95 = $451,250 at best, and that's assuming Alice accepts.

The risk of further negotiations and value loss outweighs the potential gain from a better split.
