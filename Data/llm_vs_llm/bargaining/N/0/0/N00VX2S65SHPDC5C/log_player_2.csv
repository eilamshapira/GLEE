"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. You get a good share. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's offering me $45 while taking $55 for herself. While this isn't an even split, I should keep in mind that if I reject and we go to another round, the money will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation. This means the total would effectively be worth only $90 to me in the next round.

If I reject and propose a better split in the next round, Alice might reject my offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation for me.

Given these considerations, this initial 45/55 split is actually quite reasonable considering the inflation penalty I face.
