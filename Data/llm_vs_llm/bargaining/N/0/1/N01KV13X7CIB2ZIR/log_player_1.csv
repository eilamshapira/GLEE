Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make my first offer to Bob.

""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Keep in mind that with each passing round, the money loses 20% of its value for me due to inflation, so it's in both our interests to come to an agreement quickly.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice! Let's split it evenly at 50-50. This way, we both get a fair share and quickly avoid further inflation impacts for you. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
