5500.0,4500.0,"Hi Bob, let's start fair. I propose we split the money 55/45. That way we both get a good amount.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a better split would be 40/60 in my favor. This way, I can still get a decent share.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"Bob, I understand you want more, but I'm sticking closer to the middle. Inflation is hitting you harder, but 60/40 gives us both a substantial return. Let's aim for a deal!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
6500.0,3500.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. How about we try a 35/65 split? This way, I still get something while you benefit more.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
6300.0,3700.0,"Bob, inflation is eating away at your share. I can offer 63/37. This gets you a decent amount and it's significantly better than nothing. Let's not risk losing everything!",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
7000.0,3000.0,"Hi Alice, I realize the situation is getting more challenging. How about a split of 30/70? This way, I still get something while you take a larger share.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
6600.0,3400.0,"Bob, time is running out and inflation is killing your returns. I'm offering 66/34. This is as good as it's going to get, and it's still a substantial amount for you considering the circumstances. Accept now or we both get nothing.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
7500.0,2500.0,"Hi Alice, I understand the urgency and the impact of inflation. Let's try a more reasonable division at 25/75. It ensures I get something while you still take the majority.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
6900.0,3100.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Inflation is destroying your share. My final offer is 69/31. Take it. We're almost out of time, and this is better than walking away with nothing. It's a good deal considering your losses from inflation.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
8000.0,2000.0,"Hi Alice, I see this is becoming urgent. How about we settle on a split of 20/80? This would still allow me to have some amount while you receive a larger portion.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
7200.0,2800.0,"Bob, this is it. Final offer. 72/28. You're losing so much to inflation that 2800 is better than the nothing you'll get if we go to round 12. Please accept, we're both on the brink of getting nothing.",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,reject
8500.0,1500.0,"Hi Alice, I know this is our last chance. How about a split of 15/85? It ensures I at least get something while you still receive a significant amount.",Bob,12,
,,,Alice,12,accept
