"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing an equal split of the money. This seems fair to both of us, and accepting now means we avoid the 5% inflation penalty that would reduce our total value. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split ($500,000 each)
2. The offer is fair and equitable
3. If I reject, the total amount will decrease by 5% in the next round, meaning we'd be dividing $950,000 instead of $1,000,000
4. Even if I were to get a larger percentage in the next round, the absolute value might be lower due to inflation
5. This is the first round, and starting with a fair split sets a positive tone

Given these factors, especially considering the inflation penalty, accepting this fair split is the most rational choice.
