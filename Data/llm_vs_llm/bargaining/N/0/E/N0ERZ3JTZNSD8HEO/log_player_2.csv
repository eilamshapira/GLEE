"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $40 while she keeps $60. While this isn't an even split, considering:
1. We have 12 rounds available
2. Each round reduces the total value by 10%
3. I'll get to make the next offer if I reject

I'll reject this offer. I think I can get a better deal, and even with the 10% reduction, I'll still have room to negotiate.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a more balanced offer, but slightly in my favor since Alice's first offer was quite uneven. I'll propose a 55-45 split in my favor, which is more equitable than her initial 60-40 split against me.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'm proposing a fair split where I get $55 and Alice gets $45. This is a reasonable middle ground that respects both parties' interests."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:
1. Alice has increased her offer to me from $40 to $45
2. The money is now worth 19% less than originally
3. $45 with 19% reduction is worth about $36.45 in original value
4. If I reject, we'll lose another 10% to inflation

While I could reject and try for a better deal, the continued inflation makes this risky. Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by improving her offer. At this point, accepting a slightly uneven split is better than risking further devaluation.
