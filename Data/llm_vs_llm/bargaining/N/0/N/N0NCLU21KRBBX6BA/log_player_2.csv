Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, since we're losing value each round, let's go for an even split this time at 50-50. It's fair and we both get something before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

It's not a fantastic deal, but with the inflation eating into the potential gains, getting 50% now is better than risking getting less later."
