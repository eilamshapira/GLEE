4700.0,5300.0,"Hi Bob, I’d like to settle things quickly. I propose we split the $10000 as $4700 for me and $5300 for you. I know you might be more patient when it comes to value, so I’m giving you a slightly larger share to reflect that. Let’s agree now, so neither of us loses value to delay. Looking forward to your thoughts!",Alice,1,
