"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 4700, ""bob_gain"": 5300, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I’d like to settle things quickly. I propose we split the $10,000 as $4,700 for me and $5,300 for you. I know you might be more patient when it comes to value, so I’m giving you a slightly larger share to reflect that. Let’s agree now, so neither of us loses value to delay. Looking forward to your thoughts!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you trying to find a balance, but I value my time a bit more. How about we do $5500 for me and $4500 for you?  It's still a good deal for both of us considering the potential losses with further delays. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
