"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’d like to settle things quickly. I propose we split the $10000 as $4700 for me and $5300 for you. I know you might be more patient when it comes to value, so I’m giving you a slightly larger share to reflect that. Let’s agree now, so neither of us loses value to delay. Looking forward to your thoughts! 
# Bob gain: 5300 
# Alice gain: 4700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

I appreciate you trying to find a balance, but I value my time a bit more. How about we do $5500 for me and $4500 for you?  It's still a good deal for both of us considering the potential losses with further delays.""}"
