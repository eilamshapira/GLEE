"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll carefully consider Alice's offer. She proposes a 50-50 split, which is objectively fair. However, I need to consider the game dynamics, including the inflation factor.

With each round, the money loses 5% value for Alice but maintains full value for me. This gives me a strategic advantage in later rounds, as Alice becomes more incentivized to reach an agreement quickly.

While the 50-50 split is fair in absolute terms, I could potentially negotiate a better deal for myself if I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round. Since I don't face any inflation penalty, I can afford to be patient.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer that takes into account the inflation factor while still being reasonable enough that Alice might accept it.

Since Alice faces a 5% inflation penalty per round, the $100 is now worth only $95 to her. I'll use this to propose a split that's slightly in my favor but still gives Alice a good amount before further inflation affects her.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'm proposing I get $55 and Alice gets $45. This gives me a bit more than the initial 50-50 split, reflecting my stronger position due to the inflation asymmetry, but it's still a reasonable offer that Alice might accept rather than lose another 5% value in the next round."
