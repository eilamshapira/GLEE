"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split while accounting for potential future inflation if negotiations continue.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. This is a reasonable offer considering the 5% inflation penalty I'll face if we need additional rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept now, I get $4,750, but it's worth 5% less due to inflation, so effectively $4,512.50
2. If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount I get will be worth another 5% less
3. Future negotiations might lead to even less favorable terms
4. The current offer, while not ideal, is still substantial

Given the inflation penalty and the risk of getting an even worse deal in future rounds, I'll accept this offer.
