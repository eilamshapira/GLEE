50.0,50.0,"Bob, I see we're both concerned about inflation. Let's be fair with an equal 50-50 split. I'm facing 20% inflation by now compared to your 10%, so this is actually quite generous. This equal division is the most balanced solution to end the game now before we both lose more value.",Alice,3,
