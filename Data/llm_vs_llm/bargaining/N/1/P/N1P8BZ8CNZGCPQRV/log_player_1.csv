"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll consider that I'm playing as Alice in this game. Since we're in Round 1, I should make a reasonable offer while accounting for inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a slightly higher amount for myself since I'll face 10% inflation in each round if we don't agree now. This is a fair offer that gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging my inflation concerns.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's speed things up. I understand you're worried about inflation, but it cuts both ways. I'm offering you a substantial amount here. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 50,
""bob_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Bob, I see we're both concerned about inflation. Let's be fair with an equal 50-50 split. I'm facing 20% inflation by now compared to your 10%, so this is actually quite generous. This equal division is the most balanced solution to end the game now before we both lose more value.""}"
