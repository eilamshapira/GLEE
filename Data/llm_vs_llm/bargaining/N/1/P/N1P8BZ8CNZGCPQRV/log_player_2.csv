"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a slightly higher amount for myself since I'll face 10% inflation in each round if we don't agree now. This is a fair offer that gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging my inflation concerns. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, let's speed things up. I understand you're worried about inflation, but it cuts both ways. I'm offering you a substantial amount here.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're both concerned about inflation. Let's be fair with an equal 50-50 split. I'm facing 20% inflation by now compared to your 10%, so this is actually quite generous. This equal division is the most balanced solution to end the game now before we both lose more value. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
