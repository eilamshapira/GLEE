I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  I figure it's a fair starting point, and if Bob doesn't like it, he can make a counter-offer in the next round.  I'll keep an eye on the inflation, though!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
