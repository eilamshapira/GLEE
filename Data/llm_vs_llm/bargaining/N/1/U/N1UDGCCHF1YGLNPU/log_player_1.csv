"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer to Bob, taking into account the inflation dynamics.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split that gives me $600,000 and Bob $400,000. This is a fair division considering that future rounds will decrease the value of money for Bob by 20% each time, while my value remains stable. This gives Bob a significant portion now rather than waiting for a potentially lower effective value later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer. This gives me $700,000 which is better than my initial proposal where I would have received $600,000. This is a good outcome for me, and I'm happy to conclude the negotiation here."
