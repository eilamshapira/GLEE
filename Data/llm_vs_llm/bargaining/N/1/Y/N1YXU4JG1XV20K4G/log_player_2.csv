"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the $1000000 evenly and both walk away satisfied! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Let's see if Alice can do better in the next round. It's worth trying to get more, considering the inflation effect."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair split. It's better for both of us to end this game sooner.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation impact on you, here's a more favorable split for you. Let's agree and end the game on a positive note. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Even though the money is worth 19% less than the first round, accepting an offer of 550,000 is better than risking further inflation in the next rounds."
