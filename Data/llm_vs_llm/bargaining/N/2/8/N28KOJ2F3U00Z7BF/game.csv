60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This is fair because I face a 20% inflation penalty each round, so if we go to the next round, the money will be worth less to me. If you reject this and we go back and forth, we both lose value. This offer gives us both a substantial amount right now.",Alice,1,
