"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll propose a fair division that takes into account the 20% inflation penalty I face with each round.

{""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This is fair because I face a 20% inflation penalty each round, so if we go to the next round, the money will be worth less to me. If you reject this and we go back and forth, we both lose value. This offer gives us both a substantial amount right now.""}"
