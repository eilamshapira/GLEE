"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This is fair because I face a 20% inflation penalty each round, so if we go to the next round, the money will be worth less to me. If you reject this and we go back and forth, we both lose value. This offer gives us both a substantial amount right now. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

1. Current offer gives me $40
2. If I reject and propose next round:
   - Money is worth 10% less to me
   * $100 * 0.9 = $90 total value for me
   * Even if I propose a better split for myself, I've already lost value
3. Alice claims she has 20% inflation, but I can't verify this
4. If we keep going back and forth, we both lose more value

While 40/60 isn't ideal, given the 10% inflation penalty I face each round, accepting now guarantees me $40. If I reject, I'd need to secure significantly more than $44.44 ($40/0.9) in the next round just to break even, which might be hard to achieve if Alice is rational.
