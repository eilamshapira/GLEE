"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose that I receive $55.56 and you $44.44. By accepting this offer now in round 2, we both secure a fair share considering the 20% discount that kicks in with each round. If we delay, the pie shrinks further, and you'll end up with about what you’d expect if you waited to propose in round 3. I believe this is a fair deal—please accept. 
# Alice gain: 44.44 
# Bob gain: 55.56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
