Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55.56, ""alice_gain"": 44.44, ""message"": ""Alice, I propose that I receive $55.56 and you $44.44. By accepting this offer now in round 2, we both secure a fair share considering the 20% discount that kicks in with each round. If we delay, the pie shrinks further, and you'll end up with about what you’d expect if you waited to propose in round 3. I believe this is a fair deal—please accept.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given the inflation, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This is fair considering we're now in round 3 and the value has decreased. Let's settle this now before it shrinks further. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
