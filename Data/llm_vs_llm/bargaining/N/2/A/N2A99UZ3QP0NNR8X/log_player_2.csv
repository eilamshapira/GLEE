"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair split.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $4000 for me, $6000 for Alice
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
   * The money will be worth 20% less to me
   * My maximum potential gain would be effectively worth $8000 * 0.8 = $6400
   * But Alice might reject, leading to further rounds and more inflation

While the split isn't entirely equal (40/60), $4000 is still a significant amount. Given the risk of inflation and potential further negotiations, this might be better than risking a rejection in the next round.
