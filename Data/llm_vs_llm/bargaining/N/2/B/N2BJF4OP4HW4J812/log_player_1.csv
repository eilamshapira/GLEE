"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let me make a fair first offer, considering that inflation will reduce the value of money in later rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose a 50-50 split, which is fair and should be acceptable to Bob. This way, we can both get a reasonable amount without risking value loss due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 20% inflation for me, if I accept this offer of $45, it's actually worth $36 (45 * 0.8) to me in terms of original value.

If I reject and we go to the next round, any amount I get will be worth even less due to the increasing inflation. While I could propose a higher split in my favor next round, Bob might reject it, and we'd lose more value to inflation.

Given that Bob's offer is relatively fair (45-55 split) and considering the significant inflation penalty I'm facing, I should accept this offer now rather than risk further devaluation.
