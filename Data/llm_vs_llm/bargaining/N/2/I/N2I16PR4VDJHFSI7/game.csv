833333.0,166667.0,"Hi Bob, I'd like to settle the division now to avoid any further value loss. Considering that money devalues by 5% for me and 20% for you each round, an immediate agreement is in both our best interests. Based on our respective discount factors, I propose that I receive $833333 and you receive $166667. I believe this division fairly reflects our positions in the bargaining process. Let’s agree now and secure as much value as possible.",Alice,1,

500000.0,500000.0,"Considering the significant difference in our devaluation rates, a 50/50 split seems fair. This reflects the risk we both take by not agreeing immediately. Let's divide the money equally to ensure we both get a substantial share before further devaluation occurs.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, I appreciate your willingness for a fair 50/50 split. However, considering that my share only diminishes by 5% per round while yours diminishes by 20%, I believe waiting one more round where I propose the division would allow both of us to secure a better-adjusted outcome relative to our respective devaluation rates. Consequently, I'll have to reject this offer.",Alice,2,reject
796562.0,203438.0,"Hi Bob, I know the devaluation hit you much harder—20% per round versus my 5%. To keep things fair and to avoid even steeper losses in the next round, I’m offering you $203438 (nominal). With your discount rate this round, that amounts to roughly 0.64 × $203438 ≈ $130200 in real value—roughly what you could expect if you waited to propose in Round 4. Accepting now spares you further devaluation and guarantees both of us as much value as possible. Let’s settle this division and end the game now.",Alice,3,

600000.0,400000.0,"Given the significant devaluation I've faced, I believe a 40/60 split is more reflective of our current positions. This offer considers the risk of further devaluation and aims to provide a fair division based on our respective losses. Let's agree on this division to maximize our gains.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, I appreciate your effort to weigh our devaluation rates, but under this proposal, my adjusted value is significantly lower than what I could secure by waiting a little longer. Given that my funds only devalue by 14.26% compared to your 48.8%, a $600000 share for me does not reflect the true value available in my position. I must reject this offer and propose that we discuss a division that better mirrors our respective depreciation.",Alice,4,reject
750000.0,250000.0,"Hi Bob, taking into account the devaluation rates—my funds are now at about 81.45% of the initial value, while yours have dropped to 40.96%—I’ve calculated an offer that should give you a bit more than what you’d expect if you waited until Round 6 to propose. Specifically, if you were to wait, you’d likely secure roughly 30% of the pie in nominal terms in Round 6, which—after a 0.8^5 (≈32.77%) multiplier—translates to an effective value around $99000. To make the deal immediately attractive, I’m offering you a nominal $250000, which at our current discount factor gives you about $102400 in real value. I’m taking $750000 nominal for myself, which is worth roughly $610875 after devaluation. I believe this reflects our respective positions fairly and gives you a better deal than waiting. Let’s settle now and end the game on a mutually beneficial note.",Alice,5,

650000.0,350000.0,"As we approach the end of the game, I believe it's crucial to consider the significant devaluation we've both faced. Given our respective positions, I propose a 35/65 split. This division reflects the risk of further devaluation and aims to provide a fair outcome for both of us. Let's agree on this division to maximize our gains before the game concludes.",Bob,6,
,,"Bob, I recognize the tough devaluation you’re facing; however, I believe that by taking the next turn as proposer, I can structure a division that yields a better effective outcome for both of us. Your current offer of a nominal 650k for me corresponds to roughly $503000 in effective value when devaluation is applied, and while that’s not bad, I expect that my upcoming proposal in Round 7 can improve upon that margin given our asymmetrical inflation rates. For example, I can craft an offer that still provides you with a minimally acceptable share while improving my effective value. With that prospect in mind, I must reject your Round 6 proposal.",Alice,6,reject
508500.0,491500.0,"Hi Bob, as we move into Round 7 the devaluation continues to work against us. At this stage, my funds are worth roughly 73.2% of their initial value while yours are down to about 23.6%. To put it in perspective, if you end up waiting until Round 8 to propose, you’d likely secure an effective payoff in the neighborhood of $116000. In order to make this deal immediately attractive for you while still maximizing my return under these conditions, I propose a division where I take a nominal $508500 and you receive $491500. This gives you an effective value of approximately $491500 × 0.236 ≈ $116000—roughly matching your best alternative. I believe this division fairly reflects our asymmetric devaluation and serves both our best interests by avoiding further loss. Let's settle now.",Alice,7,
