Considering that money devalues by 5% for me and 20% for you each round, an immediate agreement is in both our best interests. Based on our respective discount factors, I propose that I receive $833,333 and you receive $166,667. I believe this division fairly reflects our positions in the bargaining process. Let’s agree now and secure as much value as possible.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the significant difference in our devaluation rates, a 50/50 split seems fair. This reflects the risk we both take by not agreeing immediately. Let's divide the money equally to ensure we both get a substantial share before further devaluation occurs. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness for a fair 50/50 split. However, considering that my share only diminishes by 5% per round while yours diminishes by 20%, I believe waiting one more round where I propose the division would allow both of us to secure a better-adjusted outcome relative to our respective devaluation rates. Consequently, I'll have to reject this offer.""}"

Round 3

To keep things fair and to avoid even steeper losses in the next round, I’m offering you $203,438 (nominal). With your discount rate this round, that amounts to roughly 0.64 × $203,438 ≈ $130,200 in real value—roughly what you could expect if you waited to propose in Round 4. Accepting now spares you further devaluation and guarantees both of us as much value as possible. Let’s settle this division and end the game now.""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the significant devaluation I've faced, I believe a 40/60 split is more reflective of our current positions. This offer considers the risk of further devaluation and aims to provide a fair division based on our respective losses. Let's agree on this division to maximize our gains. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort to weigh our devaluation rates, but under this proposal, my adjusted value is significantly lower than what I could secure by waiting a little longer. Given that my funds only devalue by 14.26% compared to your 48.8%, a $600,000 share for me does not reflect the true value available in my position. I must reject this offer and propose that we discuss a division that better mirrors our respective depreciation.""}"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, taking into account the devaluation rates—my funds are now at about 81.45% of the initial value, while yours have dropped to 40.96%—I’ve calculated an offer that should give you a bit more than what you’d expect if you waited until Round 6 to propose. Specifically, if you were to wait, you’d likely secure roughly 30% of the pie in nominal terms in Round 6, which—after a 0.8^5 (≈32.77%) multiplier—translates to an effective value around $99,000. To make the deal immediately attractive, I’m offering you a nominal $250,000, which at our current discount factor gives you about $102,400 in real value. I’m taking $750,000 nominal for myself, which is worth roughly $610,875 after devaluation. I believe this reflects our respective positions fairly and gives you a better deal than waiting. Let’s settle now and end the game on a mutually beneficial note.""}"

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: As we approach the end of the game, I believe it's crucial to consider the significant devaluation we've both faced. Given our respective positions, I propose a 35/65 split. This division reflects the risk of further devaluation and aims to provide a fair outcome for both of us. Let's agree on this division to maximize our gains before the game concludes. 
# Alice gain: 650000 
# Bob gain: 350000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, I recognize the tough devaluation you’re facing; however, I believe that by taking the next turn as proposer, I can structure a division that yields a better effective outcome for both of us. Your current offer of a nominal 650k for me corresponds to roughly $503,000 in effective value when devaluation is applied, and while that’s not bad, I expect that my upcoming proposal in Round 7 can improve upon that margin given our asymmetrical inflation rates. For example, I can craft an offer that still provides you with a minimally acceptable share while improving my effective value. With that prospect in mind, I must reject your Round 6 proposal.""}"

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 508500, ""bob_gain"": 491500, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, as we move into Round 7 the devaluation continues to work against us. At this stage, my funds are worth roughly 73.2% of their initial value while yours are down to about 23.6%. To put it in perspective, if you end up waiting until Round 8 to propose, you’d likely secure an effective payoff in the neighborhood of $116,000. In order to make this deal immediately attractive for you while still maximizing my return under these conditions, I propose a division where I take a nominal $508,500 and you receive $491,500. This gives you an effective value of approximately $491,500 × 0.236 ≈ $116,000—roughly matching your best alternative.
