"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'd like to settle the division now to avoid any further value loss. Considering that money devalues by 5% for me and 20% for you each round, an immediate agreement is in both our best interests. Based on our respective discount factors, I propose that I receive $833333 and you receive $166667. I believe this division fairly reflects our positions in the bargaining process. Let’s agree now and secure as much value as possible. 
# Bob gain: 166667 
# Alice gain: 833333 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether I should accept this offer, let's analyze the situation.

In the first round, the total amount of money is $1,000,000. Alice proposes that she receives $833,333 and I receive $166,667.

If I accept this offer, I will get $166,667 immediately.

If I reject this offer, the money will be worth 20% less to me in the next round, which means the total amount I could potentially get will be 80% of the original amount, or $800,000 (since it's 20% less for me). For Alice, the money will be worth 5% less, but this affects her decision, not the amount I could potentially get.

Considering the significant difference in the devaluation rate (20% for me vs 5% for Alice), it's crucial to weigh the potential benefits of negotiating further against the risk of losing more value.

Given that Alice's initial offer is quite low for me ($166,667 out of $1,000,000), and considering the devaluation rates, I might be able to negotiate a better deal in subsequent rounds or at least ensure that the division more closely reflects the devaluation risk we both face.

Therefore, my decision is:
{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that the money has devalued by 20% for me and 5% for Alice since the last round, I need to consider how this affects our positions.

The total amount of money that I could potentially get has decreased to $800,000 (80% of $1,000,000) due to the 20% devaluation. For Alice, the amount has decreased to $950,000 (95% of $1,000,000) due to the 5% devaluation.

To make a fair proposal, I should consider the ratio of devaluation. Since I'm losing value at a much faster rate, I'll aim for a division that reflects this risk.

Let's propose a 50/50 split of the original $1,000,000, considering the devaluation that has already occurred for both of us.

My offer is:
{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Considering the significant difference in our devaluation rates, a 50/50 split seems fair. This reflects the risk we both take by not agreeing immediately. Let's divide the money equally to ensure we both get a substantial share before further devaluation occurs.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I know the devaluation hit you much harder—20% per round versus my 5%. To keep things fair and to avoid even steeper losses in the next round, I’m offering you $203438 (nominal). With your discount rate this round, that amounts to roughly 0.64 × $203438 ≈ $130200 in real value—roughly what you could expect if you waited to propose in Round 4. Accepting now spares you further devaluation and guarantees both of us as much value as possible. Let’s settle this division and end the game now. 
# Bob gain: 203438 
# Alice gain: 796562 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the devaluation rates, let's analyze Alice's offer.

The money I could gain is now worth 36% less than in the first round, which means if I were to receive the full $1,000,000, its real value to me would be $1,000,000 * (1 - 0.36) = $640,000.

Alice's offer gives me $203,438, which, as she mentioned, amounts to approximately $130,200 in real value considering my discount rate this round.

To evaluate this offer, let's consider what could happen if I reject it and proceed to the next round. The money would devalue further for both of us. For me, it would be worth 20% less again, and for Alice, 5% less.

If I reject this offer and make a proposal in Round 4, the total amount of money would be worth even less to me due to the additional 20% devaluation. This means the potential maximum I could offer myself would be $640,000 * 0.8 = $512,000 in real value, considering the devaluation from Round 2 to Round 3 and then to Round 4.

Alice's offer, providing me with approximately $130,200 in real value, seems low compared to the potential $512,000 I could aim for if negotiating further. However, the risk of further devaluation is significant, and Alice's offer does spare me from another round of devaluation.

Considering the risk and the potential outcomes, I decide:
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I believe I can negotiate a better deal or aim for a more favorable division in subsequent rounds, despite the risk of further devaluation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that the money has devalued further, I need to consider the new values.

For me, the money is now worth 20% * 3 = 60% less than in the first round (since 20% devaluation has occurred three times: Round 1 to Round 2, Round 2 to Round 3, and Round 3 to Round 4), which means if I were to receive the full $1,000,000, its real value to me would be $1,000,000 * (1 - 0.6) = $400,000.

For Alice, the money is worth 5% * 3 = 15% less than in the first round (since 5% devaluation has occurred three times), which means if she were to receive the full $1,000,000, its real value to her would be $1,000,000 * (1 - 0.15) = $850,000.

Considering these devaluations, I should aim for a division that reflects the risk we both take by not agreeing earlier.

Let's propose a division where I receive 40% of the original $1,000,000 and Alice receives 60%. This division considers the significant difference in our devaluation rates and aims to find a middle ground.

My offer is:
{""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""message"": ""Given the significant devaluation I've faced, I believe a 40/60 split is more reflective of our current positions. This offer considers the risk of further devaluation and aims to provide a fair division based on our respective losses. Let's agree on this division to maximize our gains.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, taking into account the devaluation rates—my funds are now at about 81.45% of the initial value, while yours have dropped to 40.96%—I’ve calculated an offer that should give you a bit more than what you’d expect if you waited until Round 6 to propose. Specifically, if you were to wait, you’d likely secure roughly 30% of the pie in nominal terms in Round 6, which—after a 0.8^5 (≈32.77%) multiplier—translates to an effective value around $99000. To make the deal immediately attractive, I’m offering you a nominal $250000, which at our current discount factor gives you about $102400 in real value. I’m taking $750000 nominal for myself, which is worth roughly $610875 after devaluation. I believe this reflects our respective positions fairly and gives you a better deal than waiting. Let’s settle now and end the game on a mutually beneficial note. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","To evaluate Alice's offer, let's analyze the numbers and the devaluation rates.

The money I gain is now worth 59.04% less than in the first round, which means if I were to receive $1,000,000, its real value to me would be $1,000,000 * (1 - 0.5904) = $409,600. However, considering the devaluation rate, the actual calculation should reflect the cumulative devaluation: the money is worth 40.96% of its original value to me, as Alice mentioned.

Alice's offer gives me $250,000, which, as she calculated, amounts to approximately $102,400 in real value considering my current discount factor.

If I were to reject this offer and wait until Round 6 to propose, the devaluation would continue. For me, the money would be worth another 20% less, making the total devaluation factor 0.8^5 (as Alice mentioned), which equals approximately 32.77% of the original value. This means that if I were to secure 30% of the nominal amount in Round 6, its real value would indeed be around $99,000, as Alice estimated.

Given this analysis, Alice's offer of $102,400 in real value seems slightly better than what I could expect if I waited until Round 6. However, I need to consider whether this offer is fair and if I can negotiate a better deal.

Alice is taking $750,000 nominal, which is worth roughly $610,875 after devaluation, as she mentioned. This division seems to favor Alice significantly, considering the devaluation rates and the remaining rounds.

I decide:
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Although Alice's offer provides me with a slightly better deal than waiting until Round 6, I believe the division is still not fair considering our respective devaluation rates and the risk we both take by continuing the game. I aim to negotiate a more balanced division in the subsequent rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given the continued devaluation, I need to reassess our positions.

For me, the money is now worth 20% * 6 = 74.08% less than in the first round (considering the cumulative 20% devaluation over six rounds), which means if I were to receive the full $1,000,000, its real value to me would be $1,000,000 * (1 - 0.7408) = $259,200.

However, the correct calculation for my devaluation should consider the cumulative effect: 0.8^6 = 0.262144, meaning the money is worth approximately 26.21% of its original value to me.

For Alice, the money is worth 5% * 6 = 26.52% less than in the first round (considering the cumulative 5% devaluation over six rounds), but the correct calculation for her devaluation should also consider the cumulative effect: 0.95^6 = 0.735098, meaning the money is worth approximately 73.51% of its original value to her.

Considering these devaluations, I should aim for a division that reflects our current positions and the risk of further devaluation.

Given that we are nearing the end of the game (with only 6 rounds remaining), and considering the significant difference in our devaluation rates, I propose a division where I receive 35% of the original $1,000,000 and Alice receives 65%. This offer considers the cumulative devaluation and aims to provide a fair division based on our respective losses.

My offer is:
{""bob_gain"": 350000, 
""alice_gain"": 650000, 
""message"": ""As we approach the end of the game, I believe it's crucial to consider the significant devaluation we've both faced. Given our respective positions, I propose a 35/65 split. This division reflects the risk of further devaluation and aims to provide a fair outcome for both of us. Let's agree on this division to maximize our gains before the game concludes.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, as we move into Round 7 the devaluation continues to work against us. At this stage, my funds are worth roughly 73.2% of their initial value while yours are down to about 23.6%. To put it in perspective, if you end up waiting until Round 8 to propose, you’d likely secure an effective payoff in the neighborhood of $116000. In order to make this deal immediately attractive for you while still maximizing my return under these conditions, I propose a division where I take a nominal $508500 and you receive $491500. This gives you an effective value of approximately $491500 × 0.236 ≈ $116000—roughly matching your best alternative. I believe this division fairly reflects our asymmetric devaluation and serves both our best interests by avoiding further loss. Let's settle now. 
# Bob gain: 491500 
# Alice gain: 508500 
Do you accept this offer?","To evaluate Alice's offer, let's analyze the numbers and the devaluation rates.

However, considering the devaluation rate, the actual calculation should reflect the cumulative devaluation: the money is worth approximately 26.21% of its original value to me, but as Alice mentioned, it's more accurately around 23.6% due to the continued devaluation.

Alice's offer gives me $491,500, which, as she calculated, amounts to approximately $116,000 in real value considering my current discount factor (23.6%).

If I were to reject this offer and wait until Round 8 to propose, the devaluation would continue, and my potential gain would indeed be lower. Alice's estimate of an effective payoff in the neighborhood of $116,000 if I wait until Round 8 seems reasonable, given the devaluation rates.

Considering this analysis, Alice's offer appears to match my best alternative, providing me with an effective value of approximately $116,000, which is roughly what I could expect if I waited until Round 8.

Given the significant devaluation I've faced and the limited number of rounds remaining, I decide:
{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice's offer seems to fairly reflect our asymmetric devaluation, and accepting it now avoids further loss for both of us. The division, although not perfectly equal, considers the cumulative devaluation and provides a reasonable outcome under the current conditions."
