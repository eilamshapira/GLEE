512820.0,487180.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we split the million in a way that recognizes the cost of delay – I would receive $512820 and you $487180. This split reflects the optimal division if we both discount future gains by 5% per round. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation – let's agree now and avoid further losses from waiting.",Alice,1,
