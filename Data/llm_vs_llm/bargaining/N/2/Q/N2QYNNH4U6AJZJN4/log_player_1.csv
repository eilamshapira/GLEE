"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 512820, ""bob_gain"": 487180, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split the million in a way that recognizes the cost of delay – I would receive $512,820 and you $487,180. This split reflects the optimal division if we both discount future gains by 5% per round. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation – let's agree now and avoid further losses from waiting.""}"
