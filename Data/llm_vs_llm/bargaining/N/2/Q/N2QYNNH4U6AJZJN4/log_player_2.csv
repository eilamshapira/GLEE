"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the million in a way that recognizes the cost of delay – I would receive $512820 and you $487180. This split reflects the optimal division if we both discount future gains by 5% per round. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation – let's agree now and avoid further losses from waiting. 
# Bob gain: 487180 
# Alice gain: 512820 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if this offer is reasonable given the 5% depreciation per round.

If I reject, I get to make an offer next round, but the total amount will be worth 5% less (950,000$). If Alice then rejects my counter-offer, and I accept her subsequent offer in round 3, the money would be worth even less (902,500$).

While Alice's offer gives her slightly more (512,820$ vs 487,180$ for me), it's close to a 51/49 split. If I reject and try to negotiate for more, the risk of further rounds decreasing the total value could leave both of us worse off.

Given the inflation penalty and the relatively balanced nature of Alice's initial offer, I'll accept.
