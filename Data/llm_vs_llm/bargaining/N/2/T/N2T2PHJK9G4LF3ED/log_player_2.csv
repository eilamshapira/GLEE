"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate this offer considering the inflation effect.

Alice is offering me $45 out of $100, which is slightly less than half. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the money will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation. That means if I managed to get even $50 in the next round, it would only be worth $45 to me (the same as accepting now).

Since this is a reasonable first offer that gives me nearly half of the total, and waiting would only decrease the value for me, I'll accept.
