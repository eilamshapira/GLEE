"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 20, ""bob_gain"": 80, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I take $20 and you get $80. Since each round of delay devalues the money—only 95% for me but 80% for you—waiting hurts you more than me. This offer secures you an immediate $80 in full value rather than a discounted amount later. I believe this is a fair and efficient settlement. What do you think?""}"
