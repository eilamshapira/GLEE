"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I take $20 and you get $80. Since each round of delay devalues the money—only 95% for me but 80% for you—waiting hurts you more than me. This offer secures you an immediate $80 in full value rather than a discounted amount later. I believe this is a fair and efficient settlement. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 80 
# Alice gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
