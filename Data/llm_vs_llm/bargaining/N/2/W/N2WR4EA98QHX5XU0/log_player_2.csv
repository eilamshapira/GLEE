"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer:

Alice is offering me $4,000 while taking $6,000 for herself.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, I need to consider that:
- The money will be worth 20% less to me (so the $10,000 pot effectively becomes $8,000 from my perspective)
- For Alice, the money only loses 5% value (so it's worth $9,500 to her)

Even if I were to propose a 50-50 split next round, I'd get $5,000 which would be worth only $4,000 to me due to inflation. And Alice might reject that offer anyway.

Given the asymmetric inflation rates, accepting now seems reasonable rather than risking further devaluation.
