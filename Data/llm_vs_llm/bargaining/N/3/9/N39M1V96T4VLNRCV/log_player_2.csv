"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. With 10% inflation per round for me, if I reject this offer, I'm risking significant value in future rounds. An even split of $500,000 now is better than potentially getting more in later rounds after inflation erodes the value.
