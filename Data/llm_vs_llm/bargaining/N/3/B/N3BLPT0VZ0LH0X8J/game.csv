4500.0,5500.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, the initial split was too favorable for you. Since money loses 5% value for you each round, I'm proposing $5500 for me and $4500 for you. This is actually better for you than waiting another round where your share would be worth even less due to inflation. Let's agree and conclude this now.",Bob,2,
