"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, the initial split was too favorable for you. Since money loses 5% value for you each round, I'm proposing $5500 for me and $4500 for you. This is actually better for you than waiting another round where your share would be worth even less due to inflation. Let's agree and conclude this now. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
