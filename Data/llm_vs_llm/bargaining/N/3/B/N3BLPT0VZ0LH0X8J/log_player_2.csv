"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split the money. I get 6000 and you get 4000. This is a fair offer considering the inflation is affecting me, not you. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer from Alice. 

She's offering me $4,000 out of the $10,000, while taking $6,000 for herself. She mentions that inflation affects her but not me, which is true according to the rules - money loses 5% value for her each round, but stays the same value for me.

If I reject this offer, we go to the next round where I get to make a proposal. Since inflation doesn't affect me but affects Alice, I have a stronger negotiating position. In the next round, the $10,000 will still be worth $10,000 to me, but only worth $9,500 to Alice (95% of the original value).

Given this advantage, I should reject this initial offer and propose a more favorable split in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that takes into account the inflation affecting Alice while ensuring a fairer split for myself.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, the initial split was too favorable for you. Since money loses 5% value for you each round, I'm proposing $5,500 for me and $4,500 for you. This is actually better for you than waiting another round where your share would be worth even less due to inflation. Let's agree and conclude this now.""}"
