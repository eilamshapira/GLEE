520000.0,480000.0,"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to account for the higher inflation rate that affects me (20% per round) compared to your 10% per round. This 52/48 split is more fair considering our different inflation impacts. If we continue to the next round, we both lose more value, so I hope you'll accept this reasonable compromise.",Alice,3,
