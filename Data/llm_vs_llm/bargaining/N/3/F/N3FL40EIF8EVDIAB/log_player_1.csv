"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob, considering the impact of inflation on my potential gains in future rounds.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a fair $400,000 which is 40% of the total. Keep in mind that if we go to the next round, inflation will reduce the value of the money. This is a reasonable first offer that benefits us both.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is a fair starting point. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I believe this is a good starting point for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a more generous offer to Bob given the increasing impact of inflation on my potential gains.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to account for the higher inflation rate that affects me (20% per round) compared to your 10% per round. This 52/48 split is more fair considering our different inflation impacts. If we continue to the next round, we both lose more value, so I hope you'll accept this reasonable compromise.""
