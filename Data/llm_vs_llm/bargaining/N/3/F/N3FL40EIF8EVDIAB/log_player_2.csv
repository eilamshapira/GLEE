"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a fair $400000 which is 40% of the total. Keep in mind that if we go to the next round, inflation will reduce the value of the money. This is a reasonable first offer that benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to account for the higher inflation rate that affects me (20% per round) compared to your 10% per round. This 52/48 split is more fair considering our different inflation impacts. If we continue to the next round, we both lose more value, so I hope you'll accept this reasonable compromise. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000
