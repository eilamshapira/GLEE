"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that this is the first round and I'm being offered only $10 out of $100, which is a very small portion, I should consider whether to reject and make a counter-offer.

However, I need to be careful because of the 20% inflation penalty for each round. If I reject now, in the next round the total value to me will be worth only $80, so my counter-offer would need to account for this loss of value.

Since Alice's initial offer is quite low (only 10%), I believe I can do better even with the inflation penalty.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair counter-offer that accounts for the 20% inflation I'm facing.

{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55}

I'm offering you a majority share of 55% while taking 45% for myself. This is a fair division that gives you a clear advantage while ensuring I get a reasonable amount. Since I've already lost 20% of the value due to inflation, this offer makes sense for both of us to avoid further delays that would reduce the overall value."
