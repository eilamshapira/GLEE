"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer to divide the $1,000,000 with Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This gives Bob a substantial portion while acknowledging that I'm making the first offer and that inflation will affect Bob more than me in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer that takes into account the declining value for Bob with each round.

I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. This is more favorable to Bob than my previous offer, acknowledging that we should try to reach an agreement sooner rather than later, especially since the money is worth less to Bob with each passing round."
