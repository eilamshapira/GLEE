"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. Since time doesn't affect my position, I can be patient, but I'm offering you a fair amount to reach an agreement now. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because:
1. Due to inflation, if I reject and we go to another round, my share would be worth even less (another 20% reduction)
2. Getting $4000 now (worth $3200 due to first round inflation) is better than risking further negotiations where my position weakens
3. Bob correctly noted that time works against me, not him, so he has more leverage"
