"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to avoid inflation eating into our gains. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $4,000, which is 40% of the total amount
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. There's no inflation effect for me, so I don't lose value by waiting
4. Since I can make the next offer and there's no downside for me to wait, I can try to get a better deal

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since I have no pressure from inflation and I'm making the offer now, I'll propose a more favorable split for me while still being reasonable:

{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. Since time doesn't affect my position, I can be patient, but I'm offering you a fair amount to reach an agreement now.""}"
