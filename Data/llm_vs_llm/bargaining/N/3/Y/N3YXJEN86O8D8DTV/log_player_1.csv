"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50-50 split is actually fair. While I understand the money loses 10% value for me each round, this even split respects both of our interests. If we keep rejecting offers, we both end up with less overall value. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
