"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering me $4000 while keeping $6000 for herself, which doesn't seem like a fair split of the $10,000. If I reject, I can make my own offer in the next round, but I need to consider that the money will be worth 10% less to me (so the total value would be equivalent to $9,000 for me).

Since I can likely propose a more equitable split in the next round, even accounting for the 10% inflation penalty, I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more equitable while acknowledging the inflation factor.
