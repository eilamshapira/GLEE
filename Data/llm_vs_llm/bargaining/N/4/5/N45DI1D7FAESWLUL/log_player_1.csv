Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This seems fair as I am taking on the risk of Bob rejecting the offer, which would lead to a less favorable outcome for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
