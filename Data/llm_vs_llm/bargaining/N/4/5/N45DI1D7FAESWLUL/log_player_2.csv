"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She wants to take $6,000 while giving me $4,000 of the $10,000 total.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, inflation will reduce the total value by 5% for me and 20% for Alice. This means:
- For me, the $10,000 will be worth $9,500 in the next round
- For Alice, the $10,000 will be worth only $8,000 in the next round

Given that Alice faces much steeper inflation penalties, I have leverage to negotiate a better deal in the next round. Her current offer doesn't seem fair given our different inflation rates.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice faces a much higher inflation rate (20% vs my 5%), I'll propose a more favorable split for myself while still making it worthwhile for Alice to accept rather than continue to another round where she would lose even more value.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering Alice $4,000, which is worth more to her now than what she would likely get after another round of negotiations due to her 20% inflation penalty. This split is fair considering our different inflation positions."
