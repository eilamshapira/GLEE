"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's get this done before inflation eats our money! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $40, but it's worth 20% less than the original value. So, the actual value I'll get is $40 * 0.8 = $32.

If I reject this offer, the money will be worth even less in the next round. I'll think about it...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, the money is worth 20% less for me in each round, and 10% less for Bob.

In Round 1, the value was 100%.
In Round 2, the value was 80% for me and 90% for Bob.
In Round 3, the value will be 64% for me (80% * 0.8) and 81% for Bob (90% * 0.9).

I'll make an offer that takes this into account:

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground before inflation reduces our gains further!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  Take it before inflation makes it even less appealing for you! 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of Bob's offer considering the inflation:

The original value of $35 is now worth $35 * 0.512 (1 - 0.488) = $17.92 for me.

If I reject this offer, the money will be worth even less in the next round. Bob's message sounds like this is his final offer, but I'm not sure if I can get a better deal later.

However, considering the significant reduction in value due to inflation, I think it's better to accept this offer rather than risking further losses.
