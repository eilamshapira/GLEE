26.54,73.46,"Hi Bob, I'd like to settle now. I propose that I receive $26.54 and you receive $73.46 out of $100. If you reject, you’d get to propose next round—but remember, every subsequent round reduces your effective amount by an extra 5%, while my share stays full. This offer gives you roughly what you’d expect if you waited, so why not accept now?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
30.0,70.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I believe a split of $70 for me and $30 for you is fairer considering the inflation impact on my share. Let's settle on this and end the game.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I believe that waiting for the next round will allow me to propose a division that better reflects our respective depreciations. I’m going to reject your current offer and take my turn in round 3.",Alice,2,reject
32.17,67.83,"Hi Bob, in this round I propose that I take $32.17 and you get $67.83 out of $100. Given that your money is worth 10% less in round 3, this division secures for you an effective value of about $61.05 – which is equivalent to what you’d expect if you waited for round 4. I believe this is a fair and rational offer for both of us. What do you say?",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
35.0,65.0,"Hi Alice, considering the inflation effect on my share, I propose $65 for me and $35 for you. This offer takes into account the diminishing value of my portion and aims for a quick resolution. Let's agree on this and end the game.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, thanks for the offer. However, I believe that by waiting and making my own proposal in round 5, we can achieve a division that better accounts for the inflation differences. I’m inclined to reject your offer and look forward to proposing a split that reflects the full, undiscounted value of my share while giving you fair, yet adjusted, consideration for the depreciation you face.",Alice,4,reject
38.0,62.0,"Hi Bob, for round 5 I propose a split where I get $38 and you receive $62. Because of the inflation effect, your share in this round is effectively worth about $62 × 0.8 = $49.6 relative to its full value, which matches what you’d expect if you waited for a later round. I believe this offer fairly reflects the discount you face while preserving my full value. Let's settle now and avoid further devaluation.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
40.0,60.0,"Hi Alice, given the ongoing inflation impact on my share, I suggest we settle at $60 for me and $40 for you. This proposal reflects the current value of the money for me and aims to end the game swiftly. What do you think?",Bob,6,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your proposal. However, by waiting and making my own proposal in round 7, I believe we can reach a division that better reflects the continuing inflation impact on your share while preserving the full value of my portion. I'll reject your offer and look forward to putting forward my proposal in the next round.",Alice,6,reject
44.0,56.0,"Hi Bob, moving into round 7 I propose that I receive $44 and you get $56 out of the $100. At this stage, your share’s value is discounted to roughly $56 × 0.735 ≈ $41.16 in first-round dollars, which I believe compares favorably with the expected outcome if we delay further. This split takes into account the steady depreciation your portion is facing while preserving the full value of my share. I think it’s a fair offer given the circumstances—let’s settle now rather than incurring additional losses.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, with the inflation now at 33.67% for my share, I propose $55 for me and $45 for you. This offer considers the significant depreciation I'm facing and aims to conclude the game before further loss. Let's agree on this and end the game.",Bob,8,
,,"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. However, I believe that holding out for my next proposal in round 9 will result in a division that better reflects our positions, especially considering that your share will be further devalued in the coming round while mine remains intact. I’m looking to propose a scheme that gives me a bit more value, so I’ll have to reject your current offer.",Alice,8,reject
50.0,50.0,"Hi Bob, in round 9 I propose a split of $50 for me and $50 for you. Considering that your share’s value continues to decline as we progress (currently, your dollars are roughly worth about 65% of their full value compared to round 1), accepting $50 now gives you an effective value of about $32.50. Waiting for a later round will only reduce the actual purchasing power of your share further. I believe this offer strikes a fair balance given the inflation you face. Let's settle now and avoid any further losses.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
50.0,50.0,"Hi Alice, with inflation now at 40.12% for my share, I'm willing to accept a 50-50 split. This offer reflects the significant depreciation I'm facing, and it's a fair compromise given the circumstances. Let's end the game here and avoid any further losses.",Bob,10,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your effort to reach an agreement. Given the significant depreciation your share continues to face and the risk of further losses if we extend the rounds, I agree that a 50-50 split is a fair compromise. Let's settle now and conclude the game.",Alice,10,accept
