"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'd like to settle now. I propose that I receive $26.54 and you receive $73.46 out of $100. If you reject, you’d get to propose next round—but remember, every subsequent round reduces your effective amount by an extra 5%, while my share stays full. This offer gives you roughly what you’d expect if you waited, so why not accept now? 
# Bob gain: 73.46 
# Alice gain: 26.54 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I believe a split of $70 for me and $30 for you is fairer considering the inflation impact on my share. Let's settle on this and end the game.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in this round I propose that I take $32.17 and you get $67.83 out of $100. Given that your money is worth 10% less in round 3, this division secures for you an effective value of about $61.05 – which is equivalent to what you’d expect if you waited for round 4. I believe this is a fair and rational offer for both of us. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 67.83 
# Alice gain: 32.17 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4

  ""bob_gain"": 65,
  ""alice_gain"": 35,

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, for round 5 I propose a split where I get $38 and you receive $62. Because of the inflation effect, your share in this round is effectively worth about $62 × 0.8 = $49.6 relative to its full value, which matches what you’d expect if you waited for a later round. I believe this offer fairly reflects the discount you face while preserving my full value. Let's settle now and avoid further devaluation. 
# Bob gain: 62 
# Alice gain: 38 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 6

  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""alice_gain"": 40,

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, moving into round 7 I propose that I receive $44 and you get $56 out of the $100. At this stage, your share’s value is discounted to roughly $56 × 0.735 ≈ $41.16 in first-round dollars, which I believe compares favorably with the expected outcome if we delay further. This split takes into account the steady depreciation your portion is facing while preserving the full value of my share. I think it’s a fair offer given the circumstances—let’s settle now rather than incurring additional losses. 
# Bob gain: 56 
# Alice gain: 44 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 8

  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, with the inflation now at 33.67% for my share, I propose $55 for me and $45 for you. This offer considers the significant depreciation I'm facing and aims to conclude the game before further loss. Let's agree on this and end the game.""

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in round 9 I propose a split of $50 for me and $50 for you. Considering that your share’s value continues to decline as we progress (currently, your dollars are roughly worth about 65% of their full value compared to round 1), accepting $50 now gives you an effective value of about $32.50. Waiting for a later round will only reduce the actual purchasing power of your share further. I believe this offer strikes a fair balance given the inflation you face. Let's settle now and avoid any further losses. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
