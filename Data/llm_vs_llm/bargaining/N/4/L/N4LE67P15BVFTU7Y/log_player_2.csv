"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair is fair, right? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, giving each of us $50. This is a fair, equal division of the money.

If I reject, we'll move to the next round where I can make a counter-offer, but the total amount will be worth 10% less, so we'd only be dividing $90 total. This means even if I proposed a split heavily in my favor in the next round, I might not get much more than the $50 being offered now.

Given that this is a fair split and rejecting would decrease the total value, I'll accept this offer.
