"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need more than 40%.  55/45 is a fairer split considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Taking Alice's deal now would net me only $45 after inflation is considered. I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking, and we both lose if this drags on. I'm offering you a larger share than last time, but I need you to be realistic about the impact of inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation is hitting you harder, but I'm not going to accept such a lopsided deal.  Let's find a middle ground. 45/55 is a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is the best I'm likely to get at this point. Accepting a 55/45 split now is better than risking further inflation and potentially getting even less."
