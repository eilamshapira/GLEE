"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for herself. Since money devalues by 20% each round for Alice but stays the same value for me, I have leverage by waiting. If I reject now, I can make a counter-offer next round where her portion would be worth 20% less to her.

This isn't a terrible first offer, but I believe I can get a better deal by negotiating, especially given the inflation asymmetry working in my favor.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since money devalues by 20% each round for Alice but not for me, I should propose a split that takes this into account. If Alice rejects this offer, in the next round her money will be worth even less to her. I'll propose a more favorable split for me while still giving her a significant amount.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

Let's reverse the initial proportions. This gives me more than her first offer while still being reasonable enough that she might accept, considering her time pressure from inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice has increased her offer to me from $400,000 to $450,000
2. For Alice, the $550,000 she's asking for is actually worth only $352,000 (64% of $550,000) due to the 36% inflation
3. If I reject, in the next round her money will be worth even less (about 49% less than original value)
4. We still have 9 rounds left, and time pressure is increasingly on her side

Given these factors, I think I can get an even better deal by waiting. The inflation effect is significant and getting stronger each round, which weakens Alice's negotiating position.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that money for Alice is now worth 49% less than in the first round, I can push for a more favorable split. She's shown willingness to negotiate by increasing my share in her last offer, but the time pressure on her is mounting. I'll propose a split that gives me a significant advantage while still being potentially acceptable to her.

{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}

This offer gives me a substantial increase while still leaving Alice with $300,000 (though worth only about $153,000 to her due to inflation). If she rejects, her next round's money will be worth even less, so this should create pressure to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze:

1. Alice has increased her offer to me to $500,000 (up from $450,000)
2. For Alice, her $500,000 is now only worth about $204,800 (40.96% of $500,000) due to the 59.04% inflation
3. If I reject, in the next round her money will be worth about 67% less than original value
4. We still have 7 rounds left, and the inflation effect is becoming very severe for Alice

Given that Alice's portion is already severely devalued and she's offering me half, this might seem tempting. However, the rapidly increasing inflation effect gives me even more leverage in the next round. With her money devaluing so quickly, I think I can get an even better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With Alice's money now worth about 67% less than the original value, her negotiating position is getting quite weak. She's shown willingness to move up to a 50-50 split, but the severe inflation on her side means I can push for an even better deal. I need to propose something that recognizes both my strong position but isn't so extreme that she'll definitely reject it.

{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000}

This offer gives me a significant majority while leaving Alice with $200,000 (though worth only about $66,000 to her due to inflation). Given that we're halfway through our rounds and her money continues to devalue rapidly, this puts strong pressure on her to accept rather than risk an even worse position in later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze:

1. Alice has increased her offer to me to $550,000 (up from $500,000)
2. For Alice, her $450,000 is now only worth about $118,000 (26.21% of $450,000) due to the 73.79% inflation
3. If I reject, in the next round her money will be worth about 79% less than original value
4. We still have 5 rounds left, and the inflation effect is extremely severe for Alice

While Alice has increased my share again, the severe inflation means her portion is worth very little to her now. The inflation effect is becoming extreme, and in the next round her money will be worth even less. Given that we have 5 rounds left and I have such strong negotiating leverage, I believe I can still get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With Alice's money now worth about 79% less than the original value, her negotiating position is extremely weak. Each round she waits makes her portion worth dramatically less. She's gradually increased my share in her offers, showing she understands her weakening position. I'll push for an even more favorable split while still leaving her enough that accepting might be better than risking further rounds.

{""bob_gain"": 850000, ""alice_gain"": 150000}

This offer gives me 85% of the total while leaving Alice with $150,000 (though worth only about $31,500 to her due to inflation). Given the severe inflation she's facing and that we're now two-thirds through our rounds, the pressure to accept rather than risk even worse outcomes should be very high."
