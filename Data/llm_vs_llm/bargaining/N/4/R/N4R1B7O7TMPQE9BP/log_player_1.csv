"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this.

*   **Inflation:** My money is worth 5% less.

*   **Alice's perspective:** My money is now worth 95% of what it was.

*   **The Offer:** Alice gets $50, Bob gets $50.

Let's consider the implications of the inflation. In round 1, Alice's value for $1 was $1. In round 2, Alice's value for $1 is $0.95. Alice gets $50 in this round, and it equals $50 * 0.95 = $47.5 in value, considering the inflation effect.

I will **reject** this offer. It's not beneficial for Alice given the inflation effect.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, time for my counter-offer in Round 3. Remember, the value of the money is still affected by inflation.

Considering the ongoing inflation, I'm going to try to secure a slightly larger share to compensate for the decreasing value.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 62,
  ""bob_gain"": 38
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's break this down.

*   **Inflation:** My money is worth 14.26% less than in round 1. This means my money in Round 4 is worth 100% - 14.26% = 85.74% of its original value.
*   **Alice's perspective:** The value for Alice $1 in round 4 is $0.8574.
*   **The Offer:** Alice gets $45, Bob gets $55.
*   **Alice's total worth:** The worth of Alice's gain is $45 * 0.8574 = $38.583

I will **reject** this offer, since the total value for Alice is less than the value in the round 1 offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, time for my offer in Round 5. Inflation continues to erode the value of the money, and I need to account for that.

I'll adjust my offer to try and secure a more favorable outcome for myself, given the diminishing returns.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze this offer.

*   **Inflation:** My money is worth 22.62% less than in round 1. This means the value of $1 in this round for Alice is 100% - 22.62% = 77.38%.
*   **The Offer:** Alice gets $40, Bob gets $60.
*   **Alice's total worth:** The worth of Alice's gain is $40 * 0.7738 = $30.952

I will **reject** this offer. This value is too low considering the previous rounds' offers.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here is my offer for Round 7. I will aim for a better division than previous rounds, since the money keeps losing value.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 68,
  ""bob_gain"": 32
}
```"
