"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair initial split, considering that future rounds will reduce the value by 10% for me.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

This is a fair split offering slightly more to me as the first mover, but still giving Bob a substantial portion. If Bob rejects this, the total value will decrease for me in the next round due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I'll get $500,000, but due to 10% inflation, it's only worth $450,000 to me
- If I reject and make a new offer in the next round:
  - The total amount will be worth another 10% less to me
  - Bob might reject again, leading to even more value loss
  - The potential gains from a better offer might not outweigh the inflation loss

Given that Bob's offer is fair (50-50 split) and further delays will only decrease the value for me due to inflation, I should accept this offer.
