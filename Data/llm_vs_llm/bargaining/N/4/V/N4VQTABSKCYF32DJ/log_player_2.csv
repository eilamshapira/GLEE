"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I believe my contributions to our partnership deserve a larger share. How about a 60/40 split?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 30/70 split in your favor. It's better than the last offer and helps us both. 
# Bob gain: 70 
# Alice gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This offer is heavily in my favor, even considering the inflation. It's unlikely Alice will offer me a better deal in subsequent rounds."
