"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that I'm Alice and I know there's 20% inflation per round for me, I should make a reasonable first offer to increase chances of acceptance. While I could try to get more, a fair split might be more likely to succeed and avoid inflation losses.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose that I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This gives me a slight advantage while still being fair enough that Bob might accept rather than risk going to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Due to 20% inflation, if I accept Bob's $50 offer now, it's actually worth $40 to me ($50 * 0.8)
2. If I reject and make a new offer in round 3, any money I get will be worth even less (only 64% of original value)
3. Bob's offer is fair in nominal terms (50-50 split), but due to inflation, I'm actually getting less value

However, if I reject, I risk getting even less value in the next round due to further inflation. The inflation penalty makes it risky to continue negotiating.
