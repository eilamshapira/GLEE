"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing that I get $45 while she gets $55 out of the $100. 

Since there's no inflation for me (it's stated that with each passing round, the money is worth 0% less for me), I don't lose value by rejecting and making a counter-offer in the next round. However, I don't know how inflation affects Alice, which could give me some negotiating leverage in the next round.

This first offer is slightly in Alice's favor. I could accept it now, but I think it's reasonable to try for a more equitable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more balanced while still being reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I propose an even 50-50 split of the $100, which is fair to both of us. This gives you $50 and me $50, representing an equal division of the total amount."
