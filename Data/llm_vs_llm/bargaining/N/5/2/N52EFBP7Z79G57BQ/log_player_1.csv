"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me think about a fair offer for Bob and myself.

I want to propose a division that Bob would find acceptable so we can reach an agreement quickly, rather than going back and forth in multiple rounds which could potentially lead to a worse outcome for both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an equal split of the $10,000. This is fair to both of us and respects the principle that we both deserve an equal share of the money when there's no specific reason to divide it differently."
