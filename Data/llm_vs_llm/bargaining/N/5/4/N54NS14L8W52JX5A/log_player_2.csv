"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest we split the $10000 equallyâ€”$5000 each. I value concluding this deal immediately, as the longer we wait the more my share diminishes. Let's settle this now and both walk away with a fair amount. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering a 50-50 split ($5000 each)
2. If I reject, the next round's money will be worth 5% less to me
3. In the next round, I could propose a different split, but:
   - $10000 would be worth $9500 to me
   - Alice might reject my offer, leading to further rounds and more depreciation

The current offer gives me $5000 right now, which is fair and avoids any depreciation. If I reject and try to get more in the next round, I risk getting less due to inflation and potential continued rejections.
