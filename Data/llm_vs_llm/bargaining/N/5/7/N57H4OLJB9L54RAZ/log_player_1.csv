"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a fairly reasonable split, offering slightly more to Bob to encourage acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 4800, ""bob_gain"": 5200}

I propose this split because:
1. It's close to 50-50, which appears fair
2. Giving Bob a slightly larger share (52%) might make him more likely to accept
3. If he rejects, I still have many rounds to negotiate
4. Since inflation doesn't affect my value, I don't need to be too aggressive in early rounds"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Bob wants $6000 for himself and offers me $4000
2. Due to inflation, Bob's $6000 is actually worth only $4800 to him (20% less)
3. My $4000 maintains its full value since inflation doesn't affect me
4. This is actually a worse deal for Bob than my initial offer (his $4800 real value vs. my $4000)
5. I could reject and make a counter-offer, but that would mean Bob's next share would be worth even less due to inflation
6. Since I get full value and we only have limited rounds, this is actually a decent offer for me
