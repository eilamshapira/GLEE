"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair split to start with. Let's get this done! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100
2. If I reject and go to next round:
   - The money will be worth 20% less to me
   - $100 will effectively be worth $80 to me
   - Maximum I could propose would be worth less
3. Current offer of $40 is less than half but still substantial
4. Risk of getting even less if negotiation continues
5. First round offers are often testing the waters

While $40 isn't ideal, considering the inflation penalty, it might be better to accept now rather than risk getting less value in subsequent rounds.
