"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer to Bob for how to divide $100. Given that inflation affects me by 5% each round, I should consider making a fair but compelling initial offer.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose a 50-50 split, which is fair to both of us. This way we can both walk away with an equal share without risking value loss due to inflation."
