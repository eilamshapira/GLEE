"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to consider that any delay will cost me 20% in value per round, while Bob's value remains unchanged. Therefore, I should make a compelling first offer that Bob would likely accept.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this division because:
1. It gives me a slight advantage (55%)
2. It's fair enough that Bob might accept it rather than risk me getting a worse deal in the next round
3. If Bob refuses, my next potential gain will be worth 20% less, so I'm motivated to make this first offer attractive"
