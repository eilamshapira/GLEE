"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a generous split, giving you a significant amount. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $100,000 (10%) while keeping $900,000 (90%)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, the money will be worth less next round
4. $100,000 now vs. potentially more but worth less later...

This split is quite unfair, and even with inflation, I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer. The 5% inflation means I'd need to get at least $105,000 next round to break even, which seems achievable given how uneven this current split is.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer while accounting for the fact that we both lose by dragging this out:

{""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""I propose a fair split that's close to 50-50. This is much more equitable than your initial offer, and we both avoid losing value to inflation by settling now.""}"
