"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair but slightly advantageous split for myself, considering I'm making the first move and there's inflation risk.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500 - a reasonable split that gives both of us a substantial amount while slightly favoring me as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Due to 10% inflation, if I accept this offer of $4,500, it's actually worth $4,050 to me
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, any amount I receive will be worth 20% less due to further inflation
3. If I propose 5500/4500 again in the next round, it would be worth only $4,400 to me after the 20% inflation
4. Bob might reject again, making things even worse

Since I would get less value by rejecting and continuing to the next round, I should accept this offer.
