"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me propose a fair split that gives both parties a substantial amount, while keeping slightly more for myself given I'm making the first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000. This is a reasonable split that gives both of us a significant amount while acknowledging my position as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept:
   * I get $475,000 (worth full value)
   * Bob gets $525,000 (worth 5% less = $498,750 to him)

2. If I reject:
   * We go to next round where I can make a new offer
   * But Bob's value will decrease further
   * We still have 10 rounds left
   * No inflation affects my gains

Since the offer gives me a substantial amount ($475,000) and we're still early in the game, but rejecting might lead to more rounds of negotiation with diminishing value for Bob, I'll accept this offer.
