Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, let's calculate the adjusted values due to inflation before making an offer.

My money is worth 10% less per round than in the round I began participating in the game. So, now it's worth 20% less than in round 1.

Bob's money is worth 5% less per round than in the round he began participating in the game. So, now it's worth 10% less than in round 1.

To account for this, and remembering I want to maximize my return while considering Bob's potential acceptance, I will offer him slightly more than he offered me, adjusted for inflation.

""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000
