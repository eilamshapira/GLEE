"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a fair split that accounts for the 10% inflation penalty I face with each round. If we go to round 2, the total value to me drops by 10%, so this offer maximizes our combined utility. I get a bit more to offset my inflation risk, but you still get a substantial amount. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I had to reject your even split because it doesn't account for the asymmetric inflation that only affects me. With each round, my money loses 10% value while yours doesn't lose any value. An even split actually favors you significantly. This offer of 600k/400k is fair considering I've already lost 20% of my purchasing power by round 3. If we continue to later rounds, I'll need to ask for even more to compensate for inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000

This offer is closer to an even split and gives you some compensation for inflation, but it's the best I can do at this point. If we continue, my position only strengthens.""}

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, there's a fundamental misunderstanding in your reasoning. You claimed we're both losing value each round - that's not true according to the rules. Only I face inflation (now at over 34% from round 1), while your money retains full value. Your last offer actually disadvantaged me even more than before. This 650k/350k split accounts for the significant inflation I've already endured. If we continue further, I'll need to ask for even more to make up for additional inflation. Let's end this now with a fair adjustment for the asymmetric inflation. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000
