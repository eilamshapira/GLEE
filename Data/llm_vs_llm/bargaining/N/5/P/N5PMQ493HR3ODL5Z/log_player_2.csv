"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first move and taking initiative. This is a fair offer considering you get a substantial portion. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

While a 40-60 split isn't terrible, I could potentially get a better deal by rejecting and making my own offer next round. However, I need to consider that:

1. The money will be worth 10% less next round (so $90 total)
2. Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to even further devaluation
3. Getting $40 now is better than risking getting less later

Given these factors, especially the significant value loss per round, I think it's better to accept this reasonable offer rather than risk ending up with less through negotiation.
