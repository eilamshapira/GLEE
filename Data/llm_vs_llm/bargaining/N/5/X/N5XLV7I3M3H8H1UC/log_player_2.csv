"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer is a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to inflation, the money will be worth 20% less to me next round
4. So if I reject, even if I get more money in the next round, it might be worth less than $50 now
5. $50 now is better than potentially getting $60 next round (which would only be worth $48 to me due to inflation)

Therefore, I'll accept this fair offer rather than risk losing value to inflation.
