"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering we both want to avoid inflation eating into our gains. Let's settle this quickly.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share Alice, but I believe a more balanced split is fair. This offer ensures we both benefit significantly, even considering the impact of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think this through:
* My original offer would have given me $6000 at full value
* This offer gives me $4500, and due to 10% inflation, it's actually worth $4050 to me
* If I reject and we go to another round, any amount will be worth even less due to further inflation
* The difference between what I proposed ($6000) and what I'd get now ($4050) is significant
* However, waiting another round means guaranteed further loss of value

{""decision"": ""accept""}

The inflation effect makes it risky to continue negotiating. While this isn't my ideal split, the guaranteed $4050 in actual value is better than risking further devaluation in another round."
