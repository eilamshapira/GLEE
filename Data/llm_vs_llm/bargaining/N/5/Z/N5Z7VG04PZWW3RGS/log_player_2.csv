"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering we both want to avoid inflation eating into our gains. Let's settle this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Alice's offer sounds somewhat reasonable, I'm not willing to accept a 40% share right away. There's a chance I can negotiate a better deal, or at least secure a more favorable outcome if I get to make the proposal in the next round. The risk of inflation makes it tempting to settle quickly, but I'm willing to gamble for a better outcome."
