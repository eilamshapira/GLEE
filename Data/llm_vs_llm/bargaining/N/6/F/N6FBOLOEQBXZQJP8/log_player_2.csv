"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose an even split of $100: $50 for me and $50 for you. Accepting now ensures we both get the full value before any inflation reduces the pot further – especially since I’m facing a 5% decline each round. I hope we can agree quickly and fairly. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that I'm experiencing a 20% decline in value per round, it makes sense to consider Alice's offer carefully. With an even $50-$50 split in the first round, I would get the full $50 value without any inflation reduction.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2, even if I propose to take more (say $60), the 20% inflation would mean my $60 would be worth only $48 in real value ($60 × 0.8). Further delays would erode the value even more significantly for me.

Since Alice has offered an equitable split that maximizes my value due to inflation concerns, I'll accept.
