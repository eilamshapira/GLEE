"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a 50-50 split which is fair for both of us. Since I'm facing 10% inflation per round, I had to reject your initial offer. This even split respects both our interests and avoids further rounds where the money becomes less valuable to me. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
