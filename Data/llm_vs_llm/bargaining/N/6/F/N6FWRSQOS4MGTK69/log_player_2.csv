"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40. This seems fair considering the game's dynamics. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer gives me 400,000$ out of the 1,000,000$. If I reject and move to the next round, the total amount will be worth 10% less to me, meaning the entire pot would be worth 900,000$ from my perspective. Even if I could get a more favorable split in the next round, there's a risk that further negotiations would lead to even more inflation.

Let me consider if I can reasonably expect to get more than 400,000$ in the next round after accounting for the 10% inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split that accounts for the inflation I'm facing.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""I'm proposing a 50-50 split which is fair for both of us. Since I'm facing 10% inflation per round, I had to reject your initial offer. This even split respects both our interests and avoids further rounds where the money becomes less valuable to me.""}"
