550000.0,450000.0,"Let's start with a fair split, considering my inflation risk. This gives us both a great starting point!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
475000.0,525000.0,"I understand your concern about inflation, Alice. However, since this is still early in the game, a more balanced split would be fair. I'm offering you $475000, which is still substantial even with future inflation. If we continue to later rounds, your share would be affected more by inflation, so this is a reasonable offer now.",Bob,2,

520000.0,480000.0,Inflation is already hitting me. I'm offering a slightly better deal than before to compensate for the lost value. Let's secure a good outcome now.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I appreciate you improving your offer. However, the inflation factor gives me a stronger position as rounds continue. I'm offering you $450000, which even with current inflation is still substantial. Consider that if we delay further, your share will continue to decrease in value due to the 5% inflation per round. This is a reasonable offer at this stage that acknowledges our different inflation positions.",Bob,4,

500000.0,500000.0,"Bob, we're nearing the halfway point, and inflation is significantly impacting my potential gains. Let's split it evenly now while we can still both walk away with a substantial amount. This is a fair compromise given the circumstances.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
420000.0,580000.0,"Alice, I appreciate your move toward an even split. However, we need to acknowledge the fundamental asymmetry in our positions due to inflation. At this point, your money has lost over 18% of its value, and will continue losing value with each round. A $420000 offer now is more valuable to you than waiting for future rounds where the same amount would be worth even less. This offer represents a fair adjustment considering our different inflation rates and the remaining rounds.",Bob,6,
