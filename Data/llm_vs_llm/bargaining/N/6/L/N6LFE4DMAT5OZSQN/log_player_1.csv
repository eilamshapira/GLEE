Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concern about inflation, Alice. However, since this is still early in the game, a more balanced split would be fair. I'm offering you $475000, which is still substantial even with future inflation. If we continue to later rounds, your share would be affected more by inflation, so this is a reasonable offer now. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you improving your offer. However, the inflation factor gives me a stronger position as rounds continue. I'm offering you $450000, which even with current inflation is still substantial. Consider that if we delay further, your share will continue to decrease in value due to the 5% inflation per round. This is a reasonable offer at this stage that acknowledges our different inflation positions.

# Bob gain: 550000

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your move toward an even split. However, we need to acknowledge the fundamental asymmetry in our positions due to inflation. At this point, your money has lost over 18% of its value, and will continue losing value with each round. A $420000 offer now is more valuable to you than waiting for future rounds where the same amount would be worth even less. This offer represents a fair adjustment considering our different inflation rates and the remaining rounds. 
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000
