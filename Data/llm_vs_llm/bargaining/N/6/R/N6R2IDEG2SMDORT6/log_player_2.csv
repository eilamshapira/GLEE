"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Alice is proposing a division where I (Bob) get $350,000 and she gets $650,000 of the $1,000,000 total. Since this is round 1, inflation hasn't affected the money's value yet.

Given that inflation will reduce the value of the money for me by 5% per round and for Alice by 10% per round, I should consider whether waiting to make a counter-offer is beneficial.

If I reject and counter-offer in round 2, the total value to me would be $950,000 (5% less) and to Alice would be $900,000 (10% less). This gives me an opportunity to potentially negotiate a better deal.

I'm going to reject this initial offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that takes into account the inflation rates and aims for a fairer split.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing this division because while Alice offered me only 35% of the total in round 1, I'm offering her a more generous 45% of the total. Since money is worth 10% less to Alice this round but only 5% less to me, this offer actually provides us with comparable value when adjusted for our different inflation rates. This is a fair middle ground that respects both our interests."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to analyze Alice's new offer considering the inflation effects.

In Round 3:
- For me (Bob), money is worth 9.75% less than Round 1
- For Alice, money is worth 19% less than Round 1

Alice is now offering:
- Me: $420,000, which after inflation is worth $420,000 × (1-0.0975) = $379,050 in Round 1 value
- Alice: $580,000, which after inflation is worth $580,000 × (1-0.19) = $469,800 in Round 1 value

This is an improvement over her first offer. If I reject and we go to Round 4:
- Money will be worth 14.75% less for me
- Money will be worth 29% less for Alice

The inflation is affecting Alice more severely than me, which may lead to better offers. However, this current offer is reasonably better than her initial one, and prolonging negotiations comes with risk.

After weighing the options, I'll accept this offer.
