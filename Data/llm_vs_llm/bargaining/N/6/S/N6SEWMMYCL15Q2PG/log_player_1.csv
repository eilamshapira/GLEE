"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split while accounting for the fact that Bob could counter-offer, but that would reduce the total value by 10%.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose this division because it's close to equal but slightly in my favor since I'm making the first move. If Bob rejects this, we'll move to a pool of $90 in the next round, which would be worse for both of us."
