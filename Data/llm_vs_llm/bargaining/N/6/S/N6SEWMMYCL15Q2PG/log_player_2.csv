"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $45 while keeping $55 for herself
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 10% inflation, the total amount will be worth only $90 in the next round
4. My $45 now would be worth more than any amount I could get in the next round unless I can get significantly more than 50%

Given these factors, this is a reasonable offer. While not perfectly equal, the difference isn't large enough to risk losing value to inflation.
