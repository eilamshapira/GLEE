"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering you'll lose 5% value each round if you decline.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it fairly, considering the decreasing value for me. I'm being generous, don't decline! 
# Alice gain: 5250 
# Bob gain: 4750 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

1. Bob offers me $5,250, which is less than my initial offer of $6,000
2. If I reject, we go to round 3 where I can make another offer
3. However, Bob's value will decrease by another 5% in round 3, meaning he'll be more likely to accept a less favorable deal for him
4. Still, there's a risk of back-and-forth that could waste time
5. $5,250 is a reasonable offer - it's more than 50% for me
