"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering you'll lose 5% value each round if you decline. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, the value of the money for me has decreased by 5%. So, the current value for me is $10,000 * 0.95 = $9,500.

Here's my offer:
{""bob_gain"": 4750,
""alice_gain"": 5250,
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, considering the decreasing value for me. I'm being generous, don't decline!""}"
