"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a proposal that considers both the higher inflation rate I face (20%) and the need to make an attractive offer to Bob.

Since I face higher inflation pressure, I should aim for a deal in early rounds. However, Bob might reject a low offer, leading to worse outcomes for both due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose this 60-40 split in my favor, acknowledging that I need to be fair enough for Bob to accept while accounting for my higher inflation risk."
