"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer is $40 for me and $60 for Alice
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to inflation:
   - My money will be worth 5% less next round
   - Alice's money will be worth 20% less next round
4. If I reject, $40 now is better than anything over $42.10 next round ($40 รท 0.95)
5. Given Alice's higher inflation rate, she might be more willing to accept a reasonable counter-offer
6. However, the risk of continued negotiation and further inflation might not be worth it for a relatively fair initial offer

While I could try to negotiate for more, $40 is a decent offer, and the inflation risk makes accepting now more attractive than gambling on a better outcome next round.
