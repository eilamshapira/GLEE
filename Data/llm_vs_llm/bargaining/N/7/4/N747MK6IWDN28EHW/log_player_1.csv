"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my offer to Bob for dividing $1,000,000.

Given that Bob faces a 10% decrease in value with each round, I should consider offering him a fair amount that would incentivize him to accept now rather than waiting for future rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split, which is fair and equitable. Since Bob faces 10% inflation per round and I don't, this equal division now is better for him than waiting to make a counter-offer."
