"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer for this division, considering that inflation affects me more severely than Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I receive $60 and Bob receives $40. This is a fair split considering that inflation will impact me more heavily in future rounds (20% versus Bob's 10%), so there's greater urgency for me to secure a reasonable amount now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a revised offer considering inflation's impact on both of us. With each round, my money loses 20% value while Bob's loses 10%, so we both benefit from reaching agreement sooner.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm proposing I receive $55 and Bob receives $45. This is a more balanced split than my previous offer, acknowledging that Bob prefers more for himself while still ensuring I receive a fair amount given the higher inflation penalty I face."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
