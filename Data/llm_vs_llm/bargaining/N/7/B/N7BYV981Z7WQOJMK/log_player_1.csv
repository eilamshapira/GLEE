Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a more balanced split that favors me slightly to offset the inflation penalty I face. This is fair since we both deserve close to equal shares, and with 10% inflation affecting me each round, accepting a quick resolution benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500
