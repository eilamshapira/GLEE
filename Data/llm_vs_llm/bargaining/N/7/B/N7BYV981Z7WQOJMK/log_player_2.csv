"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer is giving her 60% ($6000) and me only 40% ($4000) of the total amount. Given that inflation will reduce the value by 10% each round, I need to consider if it's better to accept now or try to negotiate for more in the next round.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value would be worth 10% less to me. So even if I proposed a 50-50 split, that would give me $5000 but with 10% inflation, it's effectively worth $4500 to me. 

Since $4000 now is less than the potential $4500 (after inflation) I could get next round, it makes sense to reject this offer and make a counter-proposal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more equitable offer while acknowledging the inflation factor.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I propose a more balanced split that favors me slightly to offset the inflation penalty I face. This is fair since we both deserve close to equal shares, and with 10% inflation affecting me each round, accepting a quick resolution benefits us both.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer considering inflation, let's settle quickly 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has increased her offer to me by only $200 (from $4000 to $4200), while still keeping a significant advantage for herself ($5800).

I need to consider the inflation effect carefully. The money is now worth 19% less to me than in the first round. If I reject and we go to the next round, the inflation will increase further.

If I reject and propose a 50-50 split in the next round, I'd get $5000, but with another 10% inflation (roughly 29% total from the original value), it would be worth approximately $3550 to me.

Since $4200 now is better than what I could effectively get in the next round after more inflation, it makes sense to accept this offer rather than continue negotiating.
