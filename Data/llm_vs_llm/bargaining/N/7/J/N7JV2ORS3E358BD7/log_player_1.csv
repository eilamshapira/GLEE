Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it fairly, considering the decreasing value 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Explanation:

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a small concession from my initial offer to signal that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Strong Stance:** However, I'm still aiming for a larger share due to my advantage in the early rounds, even with the inflation. 
* **Time Pressure:** I'm hoping Bob will consider that delaying further will cost him more than accepting a slightly smaller share now."
