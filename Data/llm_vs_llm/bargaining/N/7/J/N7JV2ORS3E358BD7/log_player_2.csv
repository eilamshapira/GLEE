"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split reflects our positions in the game. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me in each round, I'll make a competitive offer. 

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, considering the decreasing value""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the situation with the decreasing value, but my position in the game is still stronger. Let's find a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the significant decrease in value for both of us, but especially for Alice, and the fact that the money I gain is worth 9.75% less, I should try to get a better deal. However, Alice's offer is not extremely unfavorable, and further rounds will decrease the value even more.
