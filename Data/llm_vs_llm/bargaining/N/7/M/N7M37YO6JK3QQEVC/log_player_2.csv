"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000
2. If I reject, we go to the next round where:
   * My money will be worth 20% less
   * Alice's money will be worth 10% less
   * I get to make the next proposal

The current offer gives me $4,000. If I reject and propose in the next round, any amount I get will be worth 20% less. That means I'd need to secure at least $5,000 in the next round just to break even with the current $4,000 offer.

Given that Alice's money devalues more slowly (10% vs my 20%), and she might reject my next proposal leading to even more devaluation, I should probably accept this offer.
