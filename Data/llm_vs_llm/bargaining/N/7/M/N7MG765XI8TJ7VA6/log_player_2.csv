"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Alice is offering me $400,000 out of $1,000,000 (40%)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. However, due to 20% inflation, any money I get next round will be worth 20% less to me
4. If I reject, $400,000 in the next round would only be worth $320,000 to me
5. Alice doesn't suffer from inflation, so she has less incentive to accept my counter-offer

Given these factors, while 40% isn't ideal, the inflation penalty makes rejecting too risky. I'd lose too much value by waiting for the next round.
