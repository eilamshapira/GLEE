"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split it close to evenly. This way, we both get a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
* Alice is offering me $40 while taking $60
* If I reject, the money will be worth 5% less next round
* $40 now is better than $42.10 next round (which would be worth $40 after 5% inflation)
* However, the split is notably in Alice's favor, and I could propose a more balanced split

Given that we have many rounds left and I can make a counter-proposal, I'll reject this somewhat unfair split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split, but I'll be strategic given the inflation factor that affects me.

{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I propose a fair split that slightly favors me to account for the inflation risk I face. This is more balanced than your previous offer, and we can both walk away happy.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concern about inflation. Let's meet in the middle. This offer considers your inflation risk but also ensures I get a fair share. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
* Alice is offering me $45, but with 9.75% inflation, it's worth about $40.61
* If I reject, next round my money will be worth 14.5% less
* The split is more balanced than the first offer
* Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by improving her offer
* Further negotiations might lead to diminishing returns due to increasing inflation

While I could try for a better deal, the inflation is starting to significantly impact my potential gains. This is a reasonable compromise.
