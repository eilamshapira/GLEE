"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 55/45 split, seems more reasonable to me.

Do you accept this offer?","```json

""bob_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Bob, my turn and time is running out.  This is a better deal for you than last round, considering the inflation.""

``` 

I'm pushing for a slightly higher amount since time is running out, and the value of the money is decreasing.  I want to incentivize Bob to accept sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation is hitting you harder, I think 60/40 in my favor is a fair deal now. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

This offer is completely unacceptable. It's significantly worse than his initial offer and heavily favors him due to my inflation. I need to push for a more equitable split, even if it means risking more rounds."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. This offer is the same as your round 2 offer but accounts for some inflation impact on me. Time is running out for both of us.""
}
``` 

I'm mirroring Bob's earlier offer to highlight the diminishing value and urge him to accept a more reasonable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the significant inflation impact on your side, I think 70/30 is a more realistic split now. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

This offer is even worse than before. Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation disparity. It's a high risk, but I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is ridiculous.  I'm offering a straight 50/50 split.  Take it before we both end up with nothing!"" 
}
```

I'm going for a strong message here, highlighting the risk we both face. A 50/50 split, even with the inflation, is better than nothing."
