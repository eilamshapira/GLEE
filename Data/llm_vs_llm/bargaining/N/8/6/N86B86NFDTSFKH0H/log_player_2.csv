"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, I get 55% and you get 45%. This gives us both a good amount of money. We have 12 rounds, but let's agree now and both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, 
""alice_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""My turn, let's make it interesting. I'll take 60% and you get 40%. It's still a good deal, considering the inflation will start to kick in soon.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's be reasonable. I'll take 5200, you take 4800. It's a small decrease for me from my first offer, considering the inflation, and it's a better deal for you than my initial offer. Let's not waste any more time. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 36% less than in the first round, I need to consider the actual value of the offer.

The original value of $4800 is now worth $4800 * (1 - 0.36) = $4800 * 0.64 = $3072.

Considering this, I will reject the offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since the value of the money decreases by 20% each round for me, and I've already lost 36% of the value, I want to get a larger share to compensate for the loss.

{""bob_gain"": 6500, 
""alice_gain"": 3500, 
""message"": ""Inflation is kicking in, and I'm losing value fast. I need a better deal to make up for the loss. Let's settle on this before it's too late.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the inflation is hurting both of us. Let's split it 50/50. This is the fairest offer, and the longer we wait, the less we both get. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round, I need to consider the actual value of the offer.

The original value of $5000 is now worth $5000 * (1 - 0.5904) = $5000 * 0.4096 = $2048.

Considering this significant loss of value, a 50/50 split might be the best option, as it allows me to get something rather than risking further inflation.
