"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make my first offer to Bob. Since the money is worth 20% less to me in each passing round, it's in my interest to reach an agreement sooner rather than later.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'd like to propose a 60-40 split in my favor. I think this is fair considering that if we move to another round, the total value decreases for me but not for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since we're now in round 3, the money is worth 40% less to me than in round 1. I need to be strategic about this since the value keeps decreasing for me but not for Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'd like to propose a 55-45 split. This is a more generous offer than my initial one, acknowledging that time is working against me due to the inflation factor. I hope Bob sees this as a reasonable compromise."
