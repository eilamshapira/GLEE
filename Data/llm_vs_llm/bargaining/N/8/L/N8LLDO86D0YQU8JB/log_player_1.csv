"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

My reasoning: I'm starting with a slightly larger portion for myself, recognizing the time value of money and the fact that the money will be worth less to me in later rounds. I hope this will be acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the situation. Bob's offer is 40 for me and 60 for him. My money is now worth 5% less than before. Let's calculate the effective value of his offer. 40 * 0.95 = 38.

Given the diminishing value of the money to me, I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal when it's my turn again.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, it's my turn again. Remember, the money I receive is now worth 10% less than in round 1 (5% less than in round 2). To compensate for this and to incentivize Bob to accept, I need to make a more appealing offer.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

My reasoning: I've reduced my share to 55, giving Bob a larger 45. Even though it's less than my initial offer, it should be more appealing to Bob, considering the time value of money for me. This should be a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 37.5 
# Bob gain: 62.5 
Do you accept this offer?","Alright, Bob's offer is 37.5 for me and 62.5 for him. My money is now worth 14.26% less than in the first round. Let's calculate the effective value of his offer: 37.5 * (1 - 0.1426) = 37.5 * 0.8574 = 32.1525.

This is getting low. However, I need to consider the dwindling rounds. I'll reject, but I'll need to make a very compelling offer next round.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, this is getting serious. My money is now worth 18.55% less than in round 1. I need to make Bob an offer he can't refuse, while still getting something worthwhile for myself, considering the inflation.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48
}
```

My reasoning: I'm offering Bob a significant 48, while I take 52. Factoring in the inflation, my gain is actually 52*(1-0.1855) = 42.646. I am hoping this will be enough to secure the deal before the inflation eats too much into my gains. This is my best shot at a reasonable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob's offer is 35 for me, and 65 for him. My money is now worth 22.62% less than in round 1. Let's calculate the effective value of his offer: 35 * (1 - 0.2262) = 35 * 0.7738 = 27.083.

This is a very low amount. However, we're halfway through the rounds. I'm going to reject again, but I need to be very strategic in my next offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","Alright, round 7. The pressure is on! My money is now worth 26.49% less than in round 1. I need to act decisively. I will try one more time and offer him almost everything, and if he refuses again, I will accept his offer in the next round.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 51,
  ""bob_gain"": 49
}
```

My reasoning: I am giving almost half the sum to Bob. Taking into account the inflation, 51 * (1 - 0.2649) = 37.48. I hope Bob finally agrees."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 32.5 
# Bob gain: 67.5 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob's offer is 32.5 for me, and 67.5 for him. My money is now worth 30.17% less than in round 1. Let's calculate the effective value of his offer: 32.5 * (1 - 0.3017) = 32.5 * 0.6983 = 22.7.

Given the rapidly decreasing value of money to me and the limited number of rounds remaining, I will accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
