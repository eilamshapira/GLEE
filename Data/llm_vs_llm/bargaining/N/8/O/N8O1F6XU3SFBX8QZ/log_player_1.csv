"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split of the money, offering slightly more to Bob to incentivize acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 4800, ""bob_gain"": 5200}

I'd say to Bob: ""I propose a nearly even split, with you getting a bit more at $5,200. This is a fair offer that gives us both a substantial amount."""
