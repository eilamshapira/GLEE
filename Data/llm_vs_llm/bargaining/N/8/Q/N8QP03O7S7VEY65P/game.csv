600000.0,400000.0,"Let's make this fair and quick. I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, considering I move first and you don't lose value over time.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
1.0,999999.0,"Alice, notice that every delay costs you 10% in value while my amount remains intact. To avoid further devaluation of your funds, please accept this immediate division: you get $1 and I keep $999999.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, your extreme low-ball offer was unreasonable. Let's be practical - I'm offering you $350000 with no devaluation. If you reject this, we both risk losing value in further rounds. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
1.0,999999.0,"Alice, every delay costs you dearly—by now, your share is worth only 72.9% of its face value while mine remains full. Rejecting this offer only pushes you into a worse position where you'll have to sacrifice nearly everything to meet my unyielding demands. Accept this minimal amount now and preserve more value than you’d get by prolonging the game.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
750000.0,250000.0,"Bob, your strategy of trying to wear me down with minimal offers isn't productive. Even with the 34.1% devaluation I'm facing now, I'm still better off rejecting insultingly low offers. I'm offering you $250000 at full value - a substantial sum. Let's end this reasonably before we both lose more.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
100000.0,900000.0,"Alice, with every round the real value of your share dwindles further, while my amount remains unaffected. By accepting this offer, you secure $100000 before additional devaluation sets in, preserving more of your wealth than waiting for another round would. This may be your only chance to salvage substantial value from a rapidly eroding pot—please accept and end this costly delay.",Bob,6,
