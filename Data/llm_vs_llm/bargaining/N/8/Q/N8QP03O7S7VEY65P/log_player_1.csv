Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's make this fair and quick. I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, considering I move first and you don't lose value over time.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, notice that every delay costs you 10% in value while my amount remains intact. To avoid further devaluation of your funds, please accept this immediate division: you get $1 and I keep $999999. 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Bob, your extreme low-ball offer was unreasonable. Let's be practical - I'm offering you $350,000 with no devaluation. If you reject this, we both risk losing value in further rounds. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances.""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every delay costs you dearly—by now, your share is worth only 72.9% of its face value while mine remains full. Rejecting this offer only pushes you into a worse position where you'll have to sacrifice nearly everything to meet my unyielding demands. Accept this minimal amount now and preserve more value than you’d get by prolonging the game.

# Bob gain: 999999

Even with the 34.1% devaluation I'm facing now, I'm still better off rejecting insultingly low offers. I'm offering you $250,000 at full value - a substantial sum. Let's end this reasonably before we both lose more.""}"

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, with every round the real value of your share dwindles further, while my amount remains unaffected. By accepting this offer, you secure $100000 before additional devaluation sets in, preserving more of your wealth than waiting for another round would. This may be your only chance to salvage substantial value from a rapidly eroding pot—please accept and end this costly delay. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000
