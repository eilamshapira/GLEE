"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make this fair and quick. I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, considering I move first and you don't lose value over time. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2

Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your extreme low-ball offer was unreasonable. Let's be practical - I'm offering you $350000 with no devaluation. If you reject this, we both risk losing value in further rounds. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 999999, ""alice_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Alice, every delay costs you dearly—by now, your share is worth only 72.9% of its face value while mine remains full. Rejecting this offer only pushes you into a worse position where you'll have to sacrifice nearly everything to meet my unyielding demands. Accept this minimal amount now and preserve more value than you’d get by prolonging the game.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your strategy of trying to wear me down with minimal offers isn't productive. Even with the 34.1% devaluation I'm facing now, I'm still better off rejecting insultingly low offers. I'm offering you $250000 at full value - a substantial sum. Let's end this reasonably before we both lose more. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000

By accepting this offer, you secure $100,000 before additional devaluation sets in, preserving more of your wealth than waiting for another round would. This may be your only chance to salvage substantial value from a rapidly eroding pot—please accept and end this costly delay.""}"
