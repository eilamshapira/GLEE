Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. This gives us both equal shares, which is the most equitable solution. Even with my 10% inflation penalty, this is better for me than your previous offer, and it's fair to both of us.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor to account for the inflation penalty that affects only me. Since I'm losing 10% value each round, I need a larger share to achieve a fair outcome. This split acknowledges my disadvantage while still giving you a substantial portion. If we continue too long, inflation will reduce the total value for me significantly.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I need to emphasize how significantly the inflation affects me. By round 6, I've lost over 34% of the money's value, which puts me at a severe disadvantage. This 59-41 split helps compensate for my inflation penalty while still giving you a substantial amount. If we keep negotiating, inflation will continue reducing my share's value, and we both risk getting nothing after 12 rounds. This is a fair offer considering my disadvantage.
