"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer carefully.

She's proposing a 60-40 split in her favor, meaning she gets $6,000 and I get $4,000. 

If I reject this and move to the next round, I need to consider that I'll face a 10% inflation penalty, meaning each dollar will be worth 10% less to me. However, I'll get to make the next offer.

While a 50-50 split would be more equitable, I need to weigh the inflation cost of delaying. I think I can propose a better split in the next round that would still be acceptable to Alice, even accounting for my 10% inflation penalty.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more balanced while acknowledging the inflation factor.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. This gives us both equal shares, which is the most equitable solution. Even with my 10% inflation penalty, this is better for me than your previous offer, and it's fair to both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer, slightly better for you 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll carefully evaluate Alice's new offer.

She's now offering me $4,200 instead of $4,000, which is a slight improvement. However, I need to account for the 19% inflation penalty that applies to me in this round. 

$4,200 with a 19% reduction in value is worth approximately $4,200 × 0.81 = $3,402 in original round 1 value to me.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 4, I'll face an even greater inflation penalty. Additionally, we only have 12 rounds total, and if we can't agree, we both get nothing.

Since Alice only improved her offer marginally (just $200 more for me), I think there's room for a better compromise. I'll reject this offer and propose something that accounts for the inflation penalty I'm facing.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor to account for the inflation penalty that affects only me. Since I'm losing 10% value each round, I need a larger share to achieve a fair outcome. This split acknowledges my disadvantage while still giving you a substantial portion. If we continue too long, inflation will reduce the total value for me significantly.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Still willing to compromise, but need a better deal 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate this offer considering the increasing inflation penalty.

Alice has offered me $4,300, but with a 34.39% inflation penalty, this is worth approximately $4,300 × 0.6561 = $2,821 in original round 1 value to me.

This is actually worse than her previous offer's effective value ($3,402 in round 3). As we continue negotiating, my position weakens significantly due to the increasing inflation penalty.

We're now in round 5 of 12. If we use all rounds, I'll face much more severe inflation, and we risk getting nothing if we don't reach agreement. Alice seems to be making only small concessions while my bargaining power is decreasing rapidly with each round.

It's becoming clear that I need to accept a deal soon before inflation erodes too much value.

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5900, 
""alice_gain"": 4100, 
""message"": ""Alice, I need to emphasize how significantly the inflation affects me. By round 6, I've lost over 34% of the money's value, which puts me at a severe disadvantage. This 59-41 split helps compensate for my inflation penalty while still giving you a substantial amount. If we keep negotiating, inflation will continue reducing my share's value, and we both risk getting nothing after 12 rounds. This is a fair offer considering my disadvantage.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Willing to meet in the middle, but can't go below this 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's offer considering the rapidly increasing inflation penalty.

Alice is offering me $4,400, but with a 46.86% inflation penalty in round 7, this is worth approximately $4,400 × 0.5314 = $2,338 in original round 1 value to me.

This continues the downward trend in the actual value I receive. Alice is only incrementally increasing her offers ($4,000 → $4,200 → $4,300 → $4,400) while my inflation penalty is growing much faster. 

We're now in round 7 of 12, more than halfway through our negotiation window. The inflation penalty will become even more severe in later rounds, further weakening my position.

Given that Alice seems unwilling to offer a truly equitable split that accounts for my inflation disadvantage, and considering we risk getting nothing if we reach round 12 without agreement, I should accept this offer before my bargaining position deteriorates further.
