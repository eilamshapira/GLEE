"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly. It's fair and we both get a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer to split the money evenly:

This is a fair and reasonable proposal where we both receive an equal amount ($5,000 each). In bargaining games like this, an even split is often considered the fair equilibrium point. Since I would receive half of the total amount, and this is the first round of negotiation, I'll accept this offer.
