"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I think a fair 50-50 split is reasonable for both of us. This way we both walk away with an equal share and avoid the impact of inflation on future rounds. This is a balanced offer that respects both our interests. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
