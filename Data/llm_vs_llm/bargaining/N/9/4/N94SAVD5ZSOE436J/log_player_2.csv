"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 60%, you get 40%.  We can adjust later if needed. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given Alice's offer, I need to consider the effects of inflation. If I reject, the money will be worth 5% less to me in the next round.

Current offer: I get 4000$ (40% of 10,000$)
If I reject, the total value to me in the next round would be at most 9,500$ (10,000$ - 5% inflation)

Since this is the first round, and Alice is starting with a 60-40 split in her favor, I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer. With inflation at 5% per round, waiting one round still leaves me with potential to gain more than 4000$.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split, considering that inflation affects me with each round.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I think a fair 50-50 split is reasonable for both of us. This way we both walk away with an equal share and avoid the impact of inflation on future rounds. This is a balanced offer that respects both our interests.""}"
