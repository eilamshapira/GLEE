Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm proposing a 52.5%-47.5% split in my favor. This accounts for the 5% inflation penalty I've already incurred by rejecting the first offer. This way we both walk away with approximately equal value after accounting for my inflation penalty. It's a fair balance that respects both our interests. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
