"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40 in my favor to account for inflation risk. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 60-40 split in her favor, giving me $400,000 and her $600,000.

If I reject this offer, I'll make a counter-proposal in the next round, but the total amount will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation (so the $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $950,000 to me). 

Let me evaluate if making a counter-offer would be advantageous:
- Current offer: I get $400,000
- If I reject and inflation kicks in: I'd need to secure more than 42.1% of the money (more than $421,053) to come out ahead

Given that I don't know how inflation affects Alice, I'll make a strategic decision.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a fair offer that takes into account the inflation impact on my end.

{""bob_gain"": 525000, 
""alice_gain"": 475000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I'm proposing a 52.5%-47.5% split in my favor. This accounts for the 5% inflation penalty I've already incurred by rejecting the first offer. This way we both walk away with approximately equal value after accounting for my inflation penalty. It's a fair balance that respects both our interests.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's meet in the middle. This split accounts for the inflation I've experienced. It's a fair compromise considering the risks we both face. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate this offer from Alice.

She's now offering me $450,000, which is better than her initial offer of $400,000.

Due to inflation affecting me, this $450,000 is worth 9.75% less than in the first round, so it's effectively worth about $406,125 to me in first-round terms.

If I reject and move to round 4:
- Inflation will continue to reduce the value to me
- I'd need to secure a significantly higher amount to offset this additional inflation
- Alice has revealed she's experiencing even higher inflation (19%) than I am (9.75%)
- This explains why she might be eager to complete the deal soon

Considering that Alice's counter-offer is already better than her initial offer even after accounting for my inflation, and that additional delays would further erode value for both of us (especially Alice), this is a reasonable compromise.
