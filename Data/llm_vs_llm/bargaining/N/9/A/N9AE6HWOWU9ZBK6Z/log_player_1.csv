"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a reasonable offer to Bob in this first round.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

Given the 20% inflation penalty per round for me, I'm offering an equal split of the money. This is fair and gives us both a substantial amount. If we move to another round, the total value would be worth less to me, so it makes sense to reach an agreement now."
