55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 55/45 split slightly in my favor because I face 5% inflation per round. If we delay, my share becomes less valuable while you may have different inflation concerns. This is fair and lets us both walk away with a good amount right now.",Alice,1,

40.0,60.0,"Hi Alice, considering my 20% inflation rate, I need a larger share to make it worthwhile. This offer is still generous, and I'm open to negotiations, but I must prioritize my own financial concerns.",Bob,2,

50.0,50.0,"Bob, now I understand we both face inflation - mine at 5% per round and yours at 20%. With these significant inflation rates, we should end this quickly. I'm offering an equal 50/50 split which is fair to both of us. If we continue, we'll both lose more value - especially you with your higher inflation rate. Let's conclude this now with a balanced outcome.",Alice,3,
