"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob that balances fairness with the consideration of inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 55/45 split slightly in my favor because I face 5% inflation per round. If we delay, my share becomes less valuable while you may have different inflation concerns. This is fair and lets us both walk away with a good amount right now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering my 20% inflation rate, I need a larger share to make it worthwhile. This offer is still generous, and I'm open to negotiations, but I must prioritize my own financial concerns. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 50,
""bob_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Bob, now I understand we both face inflation - mine at 5% per round and yours at 20%. With these significant inflation rates, we should end this quickly. I'm offering an equal 50/50 split which is fair to both of us. If we continue, we'll both lose more value - especially you with your higher inflation rate. Let's conclude this now with a balanced outcome.""}"
