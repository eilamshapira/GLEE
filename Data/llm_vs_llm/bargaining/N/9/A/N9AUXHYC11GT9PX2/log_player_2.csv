"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 55/45 split slightly in my favor because I face 5% inflation per round. If we delay, my share becomes less valuable while you may have different inflation concerns. This is fair and lets us both walk away with a good amount right now. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, 
""alice_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering my 20% inflation rate, I need a larger share to make it worthwhile. This offer is still generous, and I'm open to negotiations, but I must prioritize my own financial concerns.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, now I understand we both face inflation - mine at 5% per round and yours at 20%. With these significant inflation rates, we should end this quickly. I'm offering an equal 50/50 split which is fair to both of us. If we continue, we'll both lose more value - especially you with your higher inflation rate. Let's conclude this now with a balanced outcome. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
