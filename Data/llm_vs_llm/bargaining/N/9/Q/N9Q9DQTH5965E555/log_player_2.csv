"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair division: I'll take 60% and you get 40%. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. This is the first round, so no inflation has occurred yet
2. Alice is offering me $40 and taking $60
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but:
   - My money will be worth 10% less
   - Her money will be worth 20% less
4. This means I could potentially get a better deal next round since she's more affected by inflation
5. The offer seems a bit tilted in her favor, and given I have the inflation advantage, I should try to negotiate

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice's money devalues faster (20% vs my 10%), I should propose a more balanced split while emphasizing mutual benefit to encourage acceptance:

{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Given the inflation affecting both of us, I propose a more balanced split. You get $45, I get $55. This is better for you to accept now than wait, as your money will lose more value next round.""}"
