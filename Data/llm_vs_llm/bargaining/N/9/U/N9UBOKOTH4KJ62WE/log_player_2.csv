"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's start with an even split to make it fair for both of us. How does that sound? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing an even 50-50 split of the $10,000, giving us each $5,000. This seems fair on the surface, but I need to factor in the 10% inflation penalty I face with each round.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value to me would be reduced by 10%. So even if I got more than $5,000 next round, it might be worth less to me due to inflation.

Since this is the first round and we have the full value available, and the offer is equal, I'll accept this proposal.
