"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000 of the $10,000. This gives me 40% of the total. While this isn't an equal split, it's a substantial amount. Since we have many rounds remaining, I could reject and counter-offer, but there's also value in accepting a reasonable offer early.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more balanced division while still acknowledging that we should reach an agreement.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has improved her offer from the first round, now offering me $4,500 (45%) instead of $4,000 (40%). She's moving toward a more equitable split, which shows good faith negotiation. While it's still not completely equal, it's a reasonable offer. I could continue negotiating for a more equal split, but we're also using up rounds and risk getting nothing if we can't agree. I'll accept this improved offer.
