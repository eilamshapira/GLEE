Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, let's factor in the inflation. My gain is now worth 10% less than the original amount (5% in round 1 + 5% in round 3), and Bob's gain is worth 10% less than the original amount. To account for this, I will adjust my offer to try and ensure we both see a reasonable return, keeping in mind a quick resolution is best.
