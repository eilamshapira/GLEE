1000.0,9000.0,"Hi Bob, here's my proposal for round 1: I’ll receive $1000 and you get $9000. Think of it this way – if you reject, you’d be in the position to propose in round 2, but your share would already be discounted by 10%, making any future gain effectively worth less. Accepting now guarantees you $9000 at full current value. I believe this is a smart move for both of us given the devaluation over rounds. What do you say?",Alice,1,
