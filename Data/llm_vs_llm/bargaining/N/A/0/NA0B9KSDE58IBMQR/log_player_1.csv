"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 1000, ""bob_gain"": 9000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal for round 1: I’ll receive $1,000 and you get $9,000. Think of it this way – if you reject, you’d be in the position to propose in round 2, but your share would already be discounted by 10%, making any future gain effectively worth less. Accepting now guarantees you $9,000 at full current value. I believe this is a smart move for both of us given the devaluation over rounds. What do you say?""}"
