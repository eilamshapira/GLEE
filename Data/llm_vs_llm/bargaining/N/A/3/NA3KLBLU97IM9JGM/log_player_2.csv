"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time! I'm sure we can agree on a fair division. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Currently offered: $50 for me
2. If I reject and propose next round:
   * Money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Alice
   * I could propose a more favorable split
   * But Alice might reject, leading to further devaluation

Given that:
- $50 now is better than a potentially higher amount that's worth less
- A fair 50-50 split is a reasonable offer
- The risk of further devaluation makes accepting now more attractive
- Alice might reject an unfair offer in the next round
