"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me consider this offer. Alice is offering me $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for herself.

While this isn't a 50-50 split, it's a substantial amount of money. Since there's no inflation affecting me (0% less each round), I don't lose value by rejecting and making a counter-offer. However, I could potentially get a better deal by making my own proposal in the next round.

Given that I don't know how inflation affects Alice, I'll reject this offer and make my own proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split that gives me a better outcome while still being fair enough that Alice might accept.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing that I receive $550,000 and Alice receives $450,000. This is a fair counter-offer that gives me more than Alice's initial proposal while still offering Alice a substantial amount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice is now offering me $450,000 (up from her initial $400,000 offer), and she's keeping $550,000. I also see that inflation is affecting Alice - her money is now worth 36% less than in the first round, but my money's value remains unchanged.

This is important information. Since Alice is experiencing inflation, she has more incentive to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. She has improved her offer to me, which shows she's willing to negotiate.

While I could reject and potentially get an even better offer in the next round (as Alice's inflation penalty increases), there's also a risk she could become more resistant if I push too hard.

Since this offer is better than her first one and gives me nearly half of the total amount, I'll accept.
