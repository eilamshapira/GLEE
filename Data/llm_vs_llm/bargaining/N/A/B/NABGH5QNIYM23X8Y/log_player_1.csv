"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I want to secure a good outcome for myself, but also need to make the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept, considering the ticking clock and potential inflation. I will start with a relatively generous offer, hoping to end the game quickly.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob is holding firm. I need to factor in the inflation. My $6000 in round 1 would now be worth $6000 * 0.95 = $5700 in terms of round 2 dollars. His offer of $4000 for me is worse than my previous offer for him.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Alright, the inflation is hitting me. Another round of rejecting offers will decrease the value of the money I eventually get. Bob seems to want more than me so far. Let me try offering him a slightly better deal than my first offer, hoping he'll bite. This time, I will also consider the inflation effect on me.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5600 
# Bob gain: 4400 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob's offer of $5600 is better than my $5500 offer from last round, especially considering my inflation.
