5500.0,4500.0,"Hi Bob, since you face 20% inflation each round while I don't, this 45/55 split favors you in real value. If we delay, your share will be worth less each round, so this is actually a good deal for you now.",Alice,1,

4000.0,6000.0,"Considering the 20% inflation I face each round, I believe this 60/40 split is more reasonable. If we delay further, I'll have to adjust my expectations downward due to the decreasing value of the money for me.",Bob,2,

5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, I'm offering a perfect 50/50 split. While I understand your concern about inflation, remember that we both lose if we drag this out too long. This is a fair middle ground between our previous offers, and given that you're already facing 20% inflation from round 1, accepting now is better than continuing to negotiate as your purchasing power decreases each round.",Alice,3,
