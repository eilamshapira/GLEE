"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, since you face 20% inflation each round while I don't, this 45/55 split favors you in real value. If we delay, your share will be worth less each round, so this is actually a good deal for you now. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, 
""alice_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Considering the 20% inflation I face each round, I believe this 60/40 split is more reasonable. If we delay further, I'll have to adjust my expectations downward due to the decreasing value of the money for me.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering a perfect 50/50 split. While I understand your concern about inflation, remember that we both lose if we drag this out too long. This is a fair middle ground between our previous offers, and given that you're already facing 20% inflation from round 1, accepting now is better than continuing to negotiate as your purchasing power decreases each round. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
