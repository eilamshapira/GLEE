Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. You need to consider the impact of inflation on your potential gains. Take this deal while you still can! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is a tough decision, and it hinges on my read of Alice's strategy. Here's why I'm rejecting:

* **Inflation Pressure:** While the pressure is on me, Alice doesn't know how severely inflation is affecting me.  She might assume it's impacting me at a standard rate. 
* **Final Offer Bluff:**  Calling her ""final offer"" could be a bluff to get me to concede.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I'm willing to gamble that I can still get a slightly better deal in the next couple of rounds.

This is a high-risk, high-reward play. If Alice is serious about her ""final offer,"" I've significantly hurt my position."
