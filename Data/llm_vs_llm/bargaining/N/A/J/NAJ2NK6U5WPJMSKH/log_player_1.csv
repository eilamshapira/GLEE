Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that any delay further will cost me more due to inflation. Since you have the advantage if we continue, Iâ€™m proposing to let you have the full $1000000 now. I believe that settling immediately is best for both of us, and I hope you accept this offer. 
# Alice gain: 1000000 
# Bob gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
