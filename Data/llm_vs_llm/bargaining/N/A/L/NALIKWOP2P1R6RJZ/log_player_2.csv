"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this carefully. Alice is offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000, which is 40% of the total. I don't lose value with inflation, so there's no pressure for me to accept quickly. I could potentially get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair counter-offer that's more balanced while still acknowledging Alice made the first move.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing an equal split of the money, which is fair to both of us. This gives us each half of the total amount, which is a standard equitable division."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice Alice has improved her offer, now proposing I get $450,000 instead of the initial $400,000. I also note that Alice is being affected by inflation (19% so far), while I'm not affected by inflation at all. This gives me a strategic advantage as the rounds progress.

Since I'm not impacted by inflation and have more rounds available, I can potentially negotiate for an even better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that Alice is facing inflation effects while I'm not, I'll make a slightly more favorable offer for myself but still reasonable enough that Alice might accept rather than risk further depreciation of her share.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering you $450,000 which, even with the current inflation effect, is still a substantial amount. Since I'm not affected by inflation, it makes economic sense for both of us if we conclude the deal now before further inflation reduces the value of your portion."
