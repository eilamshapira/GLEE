"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split, considering Bob's time pressure due to the 20% inflation penalty per round.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I offer $60 for myself and $40 for Bob. This is a reasonable offer because if Bob rejects it, their next offer will be worth 20% less to them, so they have an incentive to accept now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept: I get $40
- If I reject: Next round I can make a new offer, but Bob's value will decrease by another 20%
- Bob is currently offering me less than what I offered them
- In the next round, Bob's 20% penalty means their money will be worth even less, giving me more negotiating power

Given this, I believe I can get a better deal by rejecting and making a new offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Now that Bob faces a 40% total reduction in value (from two rounds of 20% inflation), I can make a stronger offer in my favor, as rejecting becomes even costlier for Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I offer $70 for myself and $30 for Bob. This is actually reasonable for Bob because:
1. Due to their 40% inflation penalty, any future counter-offers will be worth significantly less to them
2. If they reject this, we'll go to round 4 where they'll face a 60% total penalty
3. The $30 they get now is worth more than a larger amount in future rounds due to their inflation penalty"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept: I get $45
- If I reject: Next round I can make a new offer, and Bob's value will decrease by another 20%
- Bob is now offering me more than their previous offer ($40), but still less than my proposals
- Bob's money is already worth less than half of its original value
- In the next round, Bob's penalty will be even more severe

Since Bob's bargaining position continues to weaken with each round, and I don't face any inflation penalty, I can likely get a better deal by rejecting.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","With Bob now facing a severe inflation penalty (their next round would have nearly 60% reduction in value), I can make an even stronger offer in my favor. Bob should be highly motivated to accept now rather than continue losing value.

{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}

I offer $80 for myself and $20 for Bob. This is actually rational for Bob to accept because:
1. They've already lost nearly 50% of value from the initial round
2. If they reject this, their next counter-offer will face an even steeper penalty
3. Getting $20 now is worth more to them than getting a larger amount in future rounds due to their compounding inflation penalty
4. Further negotiation rounds will only weaken their position more"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept: I get $50
- If I reject: Next round I can make a new offer, with Bob facing an even higher inflation penalty
- Bob is offering a seemingly fair 50-50 split, but they're in a very weak position due to the 67.23% reduction in value they face
- My previous offer of $80 for me and $20 for Bob was rejected, but Bob's position has weakened further since then
- In the next round, Bob's penalty will be even more severe, approaching 74% reduction

Since I don't face any inflation penalty and Bob's position continues to dramatically weaken, I should reject this offer and push for a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","With Bob now facing an extremely severe inflation penalty (over 67% reduction from initial value, and their next round would be even worse), I'll make a very strong offer in my favor. At this point, accepting any offer should be better for Bob than continuing to lose value.

{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I offer $90 for myself and $10 for Bob. This is rational for Bob to accept because:
1. They've already lost over 67% of value from the initial round
2. If they reject this, their next counter-offer will face an even more extreme penalty
3. Getting $10 now is actually worth more to them than getting a larger amount in future rounds due to their severe inflation penalty
4. Further negotiation would be irrational as their position will only continue to deteriorate dramatically"
