714286.0,285714.0,"Hi Bob, here’s my proposal: I receive $714286 and you receive $285714. Given that with each round the values drop by 10% for me and 20% for you, accepting this offer now avoids further losses. I believe this division is fair considering our differing discount rates. Let’s settle now and avoid the inflation penalty!",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, considering our different inflation rates (20% for me, 10% for you), this is a fair offer. If you reject, in the next round your share would be worth 10% less, meaning even if you got $500000, it would only be worth $450000 to you. This offer gives you $450000 now, which is better than a depreciated amount later. Let's make a deal and both benefit.",Bob,2,

904762.0,95238.0,"Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for Round 3: I propose a nominal split where I get $904762 and you get $95238. Remember, due to inflation the money’s value is reduced each round – in Round 3 your dollars count for only 60% of their nominal value, while mine are worth 80%. If you reject, you’ll become the proposer in Round 4, but then your effective value will drop further (only about 40% of what you nominally secure) and your continuation payoff would be roughly $57000 effective. Accepting my offer now secures you about $57143 in effective terms, which is as good as your best alternative while avoiding the further steep inflation hit. Let’s settle now and maximize our actual values!",Alice,3,

350000.0,650000.0,"Alice, let's be rational about this. At this point, my money is worth 51% of its original value, and yours is worth 73% of original value. If you reject this offer, in the next round your money will be worth another 10% less, meaning even if you got $900K, it would only be worth about $585K in effective value to you. My current offer gives you $350K which is worth about $255K in effective value to you now - and you avoid another round of depreciation. This is much more balanced than your previous offer, considering our different inflation rates. Let's end this now and both walk away with meaningful value.",Bob,4,

200000.0,800000.0,"Hi Bob, here’s my Round 5 proposal. With the inflation effects now, each dollar for me is worth 0.6561 of its face value and each dollar for you is worth only 0.4096. If you reject and become the proposer in Round 6, you can expect to secure nearly the entire pie—but your dollars will then be worth only 0.32768 each, giving you roughly 327680 in effective value. To match that payoff in this round, you need a nominal share of about 800000 dollars (since 800000 × 0.4096 ≈ 327680). I’m therefore offering you 800000 and keeping 200000 for myself (which, at my multiplier, amounts to about 131220 effective dollars). Accepting now ensures we both avoid further steep depreciation. Let’s wrap this up and get real value out of our split!",Alice,5,
