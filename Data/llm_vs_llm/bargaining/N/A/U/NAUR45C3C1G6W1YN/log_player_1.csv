"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

My reasoning is that I'm hoping to get a slightly larger share to compensate for the potential inflation in future rounds. I'm starting with a relatively fair split that still favors me slightly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of Bob's offer, taking inflation into account.

*   **Alice's Gain:** $4750 * (1 - 0.10) = $4275
*   **Bob's Gain:** $5250 * (1 - 0.05) = $4987.50

Given the inflation, this is a relatively even split, and I'm starting to lose value. I'll accept the offer.
