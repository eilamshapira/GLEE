"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 20% inflation, any amount I get next round will be worth 20% less to me
4. If I reject, my $40 would become worth $32 in purchasing power next round

While I could try to negotiate for more, the risk of losing value due to inflation and the possibility of prolonged negotiation makes this a reasonable offer. $40 now is better than potentially getting a higher nominal amount that's worth less later.
