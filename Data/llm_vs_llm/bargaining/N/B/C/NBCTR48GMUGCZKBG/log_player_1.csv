"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I'll make the first offer. Considering the game rules and the 5% inflation for me, I want to secure a significant portion early.

Here's my offer in JSON format:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I have to consider the inflation and the remaining rounds.

*   **My perspective (Alice):** My money is worth 5% less than in Round 1.
*   **Bob's perspective:** Bob's money is worth 10% less than in Round 1.

The offer is $500,000 for me.

I will **reject** this offer.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, it's round 3. The money is worth less to me than before, and I'm getting fewer rounds. I need to be more aggressive to secure a good outcome.

Here's my offer:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to analyze the situation carefully.

*   **My perspective (Alice):** My money is worth 14.26% less than in Round 1. $450,000 now is less valuable than $600,000 in Round 1.
*   **Bob's perspective:** Bob's money is worth 27.1% less than in Round 1.

Considering the diminishing value of the money and the limited rounds, I'll **accept** this offer to secure a portion of the money.
