"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. I want to account for the inflation affecting me, but I also want to make a reasonable offer to avoid multiple rounds.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the inflation impact. My original $60 would now be worth $57. Bob's offer of $45 would be worth $45 to him, but is significantly less than my adjusted desired amount. I will reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, hoping Bob will yield.

```json
{
 ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, round 3. My money is now worth 10% less than in round 1. I need to factor this in, but also be mindful of Bob's potential willingness to accept a reasonable offer. I will offer slightly less than my initial offer, hoping to secure a deal while still accounting for the inflation impact on me.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 58,
  ""bob_gain"": 42
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, this is getting tight. My money is worth significantly less now, and Bob's is even worse. His offer of $40 is quite low, considering the impact of inflation on me. However, the inflation is hitting him even harder. If I reject, the next round will be even worse. I will accept this offer, as the cost of rejecting is likely to be higher than the loss I take from accepting a lower amount.
