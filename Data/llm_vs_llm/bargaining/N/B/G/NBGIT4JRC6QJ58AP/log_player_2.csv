Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice's offer seems slightly better in this round, it's important to remember that the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me due to inflation. Accepting only $42 after rejecting $40 in the first round is a poor outcome. It's worth risking another rejection to try and secure a better deal."
