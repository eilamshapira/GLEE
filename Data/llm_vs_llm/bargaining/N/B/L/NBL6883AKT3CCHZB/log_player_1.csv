"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a reasonably fair offer, but keeping a slight advantage for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

My proposal: I get $60, and Bob gets $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","While I tried to get a bit more in my first offer, a 50-50 split is completely fair and reasonable. There's no reason to risk further rounds when we have a fair split on the table.
