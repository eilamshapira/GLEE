"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair initial offer, giving slightly more to Bob to encourage acceptance and avoid losing value through inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 480000, ""bob_gain"": 520000}

I propose this split because:
1. It's close to 50-50, showing fairness
2. Giving Bob a slightly larger share (52%) makes it more likely he'll accept
3. If he declines, we both risk losing value due to the 5% inflation per round
4. This is better than risking multiple rounds of negotiation where we both end up with less"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because:
1. While it's slightly less favorable than my initial proposal, it's still a reasonable split
2. If I reject, the next round will have 5% more inflation, reducing the real value for both of us
3. Getting $450,000 now is better than risking further negotiations where we might both end up with less
4. The difference between this offer and my initial proposal isn't large enough to justify the risk of continued negotiation"
