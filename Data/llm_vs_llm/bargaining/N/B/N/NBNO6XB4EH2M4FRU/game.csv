5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, my previous offer wasn't accepted, and now your offer is a straight split. Given the inflation affecting me, I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor this round. It's a slightly better offer than a 50/50, and we're still negotiating.",Alice,3,

5100.0,4900.0,"Bob, we're running out of time and inflation is hurting us both. I'll move closer to your previous offer with a 51/49 split for me, hoping we can reach an agreement. It's a small difference, but enough to compensate for the inflation.",Alice,5,
