"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since I'm facing 10% inflation each round while you aren't, a more balanced split would be fair. This 55-45 split gives us both a good outcome and prevents value loss from further negotiations. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
