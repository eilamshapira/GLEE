"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think a 70-30 split is fair for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Alice is offering me $3,000 out of $10,000
2. If I reject, we go to next round where:
   * I can make a counter-offer
   * But my money will be worth 10% less
   * My $3,000 now would become worth $2,700 next round

A 70-30 split in Alice's favor seems quite unfair, especially since I'm the one facing inflation pressure. I should reject and propose a more equitable split in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a more balanced offer, considering the inflation factor:

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Since I'm facing 10% inflation each round while you aren't, a more balanced split would be fair. This 55-45 split gives us both a good outcome and prevents value loss from further negotiations.""}"
