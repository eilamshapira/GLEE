"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer, taking into account the potential for inflation affecting me:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

My reasoning: I'm starting with a slightly more favorable split for myself to try and secure a good outcome early on. I am aware of the risk that Bob might reject the offer."
