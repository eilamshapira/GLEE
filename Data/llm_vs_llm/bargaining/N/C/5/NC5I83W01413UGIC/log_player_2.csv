Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle of my first offer and your last 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, it's important to consider the impact of inflation on my potential gains. Accepting this offer would mean I receive 450,000, which is significantly less than the 500,000 I offered in the previous round due to the 36% inflation hit. 

I need to push for a more favorable split while also remaining aware that each round diminishes the value of the money."
