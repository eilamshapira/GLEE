"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer that takes into account my concerns about inflation while being fair to both parties.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split, which seems fair for our first round of negotiation. Given that inflation reduces the value by 5% each round for me, I think it's reasonable to start with an equal division."
