"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer that considers the inflationary impact on both of us, especially since it affects me more significantly.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. Since inflation hits my share harder (20% per round versus your 5%), this slightly higher portion for me helps balance the time pressure. This is a fair first offer that gives both of us substantial value without unnecessary delay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to consider that with each round, inflation impacts me more significantly than Bob. Let me make a more balanced proposal.

{""alice_gain"": 580000, 
""bob_gain"": 420000}

Given that my money loses value at 20% per round compared to your 5%, I'm proposing a 58-42 split. This accounts for the disproportionate inflation impact while still offering you a substantial portion. We're now in round 3, meaning both of us have already lost value due to inflation. Let's reach an agreement and avoid further depreciation of our potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 460000 
# Bob gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
