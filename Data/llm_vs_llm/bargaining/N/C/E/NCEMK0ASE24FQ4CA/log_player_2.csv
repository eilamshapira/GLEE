"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $450,000 while taking $550,000. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total money will be worth 5% less to me but 20% less to Alice. This gives me some leverage in negotiations.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll make a counter-offer that takes into account our different inflation rates. Given that money depreciates faster for Alice (20% per round) than for me (5% per round), I can propose a slightly better deal for myself while still being reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing an even 50-50 split of the money. This is fair and gives Alice a strong incentive to accept rather than continuing to the next round where the money would be worth significantly less to her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. Alice is now offering me $420,000, which is less than her initial offer of $450,000. Due to inflation, the money is now worth 9.75% less to me than in round 1, which means the $420,000 is effectively worth about $379,050 compared to round 1 values.

If I reject and we go to round 4, the inflation will continue to affect both of us, but more severely for Alice. I should use this leverage.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a strategic counter-offer that considers our different inflation rates. At this point, Alice is facing much steeper inflation (36% so far) compared to my 9.75%, giving me increasing leverage as rounds progress.

{""bob_gain"": 540000, ""alice_gain"": 460000}

I'm proposing a 54-46 split in my favor. This offer actually gives Alice more in absolute terms than what I would have received under her previous offer. Given that money depreciates much faster for her (20% per round vs my 5%), accepting this offer now is better for her than continuing to negotiate, as her purchasing power decreases substantially with each round."
