Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Taking Alice's deal now would net me approximately $368,750 in round 1 value (due to the 9.75% inflation). My last offer, even with another round of inflation, would likely net me more than that if Alice accepts a roughly even split.  I need to push Alice towards a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}
``` 

This is my final offer of a perfectly even split. It's fair and avoids further losses due to inflation.  It would be in Alice's best interest to accept."
