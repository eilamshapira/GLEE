"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering you'll lose value in future rounds due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the inflation puts me at a disadvantage, but your initial offer was too low. Let's settle this fairly. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
* If I accept, I get $45
* If I reject, we go to next round where:
   - I can make a new offer
   - Bob's money will be worth another 10% less
   - My money keeps its full value
   - Bob is showing sensitivity to inflation but still wants majority

Since Bob's money will be worth less next round, I have negotiating leverage. I can likely get a better deal by rejecting and making a new offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Due to 20% inflation on your side now, this 65-35 split actually gives you equivalent value to what you offered me. Let's conclude this now before further inflation reduces your value more.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic. The inflation is working against me, but dragging this out only hurts us both. I'm proposing a 50/50 split. It's the fairest option at this point. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
* If I accept, I get $50
* If I reject:
   - Next round I can make a new offer
   - Bob's money will be worth about 35% less than original value
   - My money keeps full value
   - Bob is moving towards more balanced splits

However, $50 is actually a good offer - it's more than my original $45 portion from Bob's first offer. While I could potentially get more by continuing, the risk of prolonging negotiations might not be worth it, and this is a fair split.
