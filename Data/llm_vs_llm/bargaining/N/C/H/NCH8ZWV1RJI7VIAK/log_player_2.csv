Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I understand the inflation puts me at a disadvantage, but your initial offer was too low. Let's settle this fairly. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Due to 20% inflation on your side now, this 65-35 split actually gives you equivalent value to what you offered me. Let's conclude this now before further inflation reduces your value more. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is framing it as a fair deal, she's benefiting significantly from my disadvantage. Accepting 35% now is better than getting even less in future rounds, but I believe I can still negotiate a better outcome.  My goal is to secure at least 45% of the initial value."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. The inflation is working against me, but dragging this out only hurts us both. I'm proposing a 50/50 split. It's the fairest option at this point.""}"
