"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, Iâ€™m proposing a fair 50/50 split right from the start. Locking it in now avoids the inflation risk on my side. Looking forward to a quick and mutually beneficial agreement!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your fair offer, but considering the inflation risk on my side, I need a slight advantage. Let's settle with 55/45 in my favor to compensate for the potential loss in value. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
