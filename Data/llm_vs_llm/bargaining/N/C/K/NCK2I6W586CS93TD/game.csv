450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a more equitable split is in order. How about we split the difference a bit -  550000 for me and 450000 for you?  Let's settle this before inflation eats away at our potential gains.",Bob,2,

470000.0,530000.0,"Hi Bob, I know we've both seen our potential gains shrink with each round. To avoid further inflation losses, I'm offering 470000 for me and 530000 for you. This gives you a slightly better share than before and locks in our deal now. Let's settle and move on before the numbers shrink any further!",Alice,3,
