Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a more equitable split is in order. How about we split the difference a bit -  550,000 for me and 450,000 for you?  Let's settle this before inflation eats away at our potential gains.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I know we've both seen our potential gains shrink with each round. To avoid further inflation losses, I'm offering 470000 for me and 530000 for you. This gives you a slightly better share than before and locks in our deal now. Let's settle and move on before the numbers shrink any further! 
# Bob gain: 530000 
# Alice gain: 470000
