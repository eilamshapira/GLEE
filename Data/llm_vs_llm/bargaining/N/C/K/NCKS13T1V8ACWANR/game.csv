6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 60-40 split in my favor because inflation impacts me more severely (10% vs your 5%). This is actually fair when you consider the time value - if we keep going back and forth, we both lose value. Let's make a deal now and both walk away with a good amount.",Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your point about inflation, but I believe a 55-45 split in my favor is more equitable considering the initial value and the rate at which our money devalues. Let's settle this round to avoid further loss in value for both of us.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5750.0,4250.0,"Bob, let's be practical about this. With each round, I lose 10% value while you only lose 5%. If we continue, this hurts me more than you. A 57.5-42.5 split acknowledges both our positions and the asymmetric inflation. This is my best offer - if we keep going, we both lose more value, especially me. Let's conclude this now with a fair compromise.",Alice,3,

4750.0,5250.0,"Alice, I see your point about the asymmetric impact of inflation, but I believe a 52.5-47.5 split in my favor better reflects the current value of the money for both of us. We're now facing even greater losses with each round. Let's agree on this to minimize our losses and move forward.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, we need to finalize this now. We've gone through multiple rounds, and with each round, I'm losing significantly more value (10% per round vs your 5%). This 55-45 split in my favor is a reasonable compromise considering the disproportionate inflation impact on me. If we continue further, we both lose substantially more. Let's end this negotiation with this balanced offer and both walk away with decent value.",Alice,5,
