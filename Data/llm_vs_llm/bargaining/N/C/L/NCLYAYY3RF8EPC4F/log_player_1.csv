"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. I need to account for the decreasing value of the money with each round. Since it's Round 1, I'll start with a relatively generous offer to increase the chances of acceptance.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. The $50 offer is worth $50 * 0.8 = $40 to me now, accounting for the 20% inflation. Bob's gain is worth $50 * 0.95 = $47.5 to him.

I will accept.
