"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, don't risk losing it all! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me 4000$ while taking 6000$ for herself
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 20% less to me in the next round
3. If I make a counter-offer in round 2, my 4000$ would only be worth 3200$ to me
4. Alice has no inflation penalty, so she has more negotiating power
5. While this isn't a 50-50 split, given my inflation disadvantage, it's actually a reasonable offer
