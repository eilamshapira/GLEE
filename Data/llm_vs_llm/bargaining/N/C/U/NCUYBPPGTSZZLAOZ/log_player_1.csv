"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"":8000,""bob_gain"":2000,""message"":""Let's start with a fair split. I take 80% and you take 20%. This way, we both get something!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I suggest a fair 50-50 split. This gives us both $5000. Remember that your money loses 20% value each round, so it's in your interest to reach an agreement soon. This is a genuinely fair offer given our different inflation rates. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
