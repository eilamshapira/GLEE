"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I take 80% and you take 20%. This way, we both get something! 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

Alice is proposing an 80-20 split in her favor, giving me $2,000 and herself $8,000.

Given the game parameters:
- We have 12 rounds maximum
- My money doesn't lose value over rounds (0% inflation)
- Alice faces 20% inflation per round

This offer is clearly not advantageous for me. Since my money doesn't lose value, I should aim for a better split. In fact, I have the stronger position in these negotiations since time affects Alice more than me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Given my advantageous position with no inflation penalty, I can propose a more balanced split while still recognizing Alice's time pressure.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""I suggest a fair 50-50 split. This gives us both $5,000. Remember that your money loses 20% value each round, so it's in your interest to reach an agreement soon. This is a genuinely fair offer given our different inflation rates.""}"
