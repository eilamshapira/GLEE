4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, I appreciate your commitment to fairness. However, as each round further reduces our money's value – especially yours – it's in both our interests to settle sooner rather than later. In this offer, I'm taking a slightly larger share to reflect the lower devaluation on my side. Accepting 4500 now secures you a solid amount without risking further loss in value. Let's lock this in for both our benefits.",Bob,2,

4800.0,5200.0,"Thanks for your last offer, Bob. I understand your point about inflation. I'm offering you a slightly larger share this time while still ensuring I get a fair piece. Let's make this work for both of us!",Alice,3,
,,"Alice, thanks for your thoughtful proposal. Given the inflation hitting our potential earnings further in future rounds, I believe locking in 5200 for me and 4800 for you now is our best practical move. Let's finalize this deal and avoid further losses!",Bob,3,accept
