"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your commitment to fairness. However, as each round further reduces our money's value – especially yours – it's in both our interests to settle sooner rather than later. In this offer, I'm taking a slightly larger share to reflect the lower devaluation on my side. Accepting 4500 now secures you a solid amount without risking further loss in value. Let's lock this in for both our benefits. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
