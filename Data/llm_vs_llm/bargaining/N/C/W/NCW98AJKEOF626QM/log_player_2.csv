"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair and split the $10000 equally. This way, we both win right from the beginning! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your commitment to fairness. However, as each round further reduces our money's value – especially yours – it's in both our interests to settle sooner rather than later. In this offer, I'm taking a slightly larger share to reflect the lower devaluation on my side. Accepting 4500 now secures you a solid amount without risking further loss in value. Let's lock this in for both our benefits.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your last offer, Bob. I understand your point about inflation. I'm offering you a slightly larger share this time while still ensuring I get a fair piece. Let's make this work for both of us! 
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for your thoughtful proposal. Given the inflation hitting our potential earnings further in future rounds, I believe locking in 5200 for me and 4800 for you now is our best practical move. Let's finalize this deal and avoid further losses!""}"
