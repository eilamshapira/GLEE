"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Fair share, let's end early""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money more evenly. This offer benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the 10% inflation, the actual values would be:
Alice gain: 4500 * 0.9 = 4050
Bob gain: 5500 * 0.9 = 4950

I don't think this is a fair split, and I'd like to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Due to the 10% inflation in each round, the money is now worth 20% less than the original amount (10% in Round 1 + 10% in Round 2). So, the actual values would be:
Original amount * 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 of the original amount

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 5400, 
""bob_gain"": 4600, 
""message"": ""Last chance for a reasonable split, don't let inflation eat away our money""}"
