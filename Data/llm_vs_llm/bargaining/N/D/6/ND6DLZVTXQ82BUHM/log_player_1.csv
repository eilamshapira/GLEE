Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, it seems Bob is aiming for a more even split. Given the inflation affecting my gains and the fact that we're already in round 3, I need to balance getting a reasonable amount with ensuring he accepts the offer. My gains are now worth 20% less than in round 1.
