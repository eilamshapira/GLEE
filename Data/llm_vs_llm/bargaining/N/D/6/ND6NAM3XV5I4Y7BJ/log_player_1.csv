"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer to divide the $1,000,000. Since I know inflation affects me by reducing the value of money by 10% each round, I want to reach a fair agreement quickly.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose we split the money evenly, $500,000 each. This is a fair division that benefits both of us equally, and it allows us to conclude the negotiation immediately without losing value to inflation."
