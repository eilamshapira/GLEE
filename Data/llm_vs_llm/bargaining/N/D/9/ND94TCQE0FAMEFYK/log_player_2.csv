"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I propose 6000$ for me and 4000$ for you. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me 4000$ in the first round
2. If I reject, we move to round 2, where I can make an offer, but the money will be worth 10% less to me
3. After the 10% inflation, 4000$ now would be worth more than 4000$ in the next round
4. While I could try to negotiate for more, there's a risk of losing value through inflation
5. However, this initial split (60-40) feels a bit unfair given we're starting fresh

Given that we have multiple rounds to negotiate and I'm in a position to make a counter-offer, I'll reject this offer and try to get a more equitable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split while considering that Alice shown interest in getting a larger share.

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""I believe a 50-50 split is the fairest way to start. This way we both get $5000, and we can avoid losing value through inflation by agreeing now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: How about I take 5500$ and you take 4500$? This is closer to an even split, considering the inflation effect on your side. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $4500, but with 19% inflation, it's actually worth about $3645 to me
2. Alice has moved from her initial 60-40 split to a 55-45 split, showing willingness to negotiate
3. If I reject, we move to round 4, where:
   - The inflation will be even higher (around 29%)
   - I can make an offer, but any amount will be worth significantly less to me
4. Alice seems to understand the inflation pressure I'm under and is using it as leverage
5. There's a risk that continued negotiation will only decrease my real value due to inflation

Given the mounting inflation pressure and Alice's movement toward a more reasonable split, I should accept this offer. Further negotiation would likely result in less real value for me.
