# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering the impact of inflation and our previous rounds, I suggest we settle with me taking $550000 and you getting $450000. This way, we both get a reasonable share despite the decreasing value. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000
