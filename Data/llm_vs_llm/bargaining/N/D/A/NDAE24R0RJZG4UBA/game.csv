500000.0,500000.0,Let's split the $1000000 equally. It's the fairest starting point for both of us. What do you think?,Alice,1,

310345.0,689655.0,"Hi Alice, based on our differing rates of devaluation in each round and anticipating future counter‐offers, I’m proposing that I receive $689655 and you receive $310345. This division reflects the equilibrium if we were to continue bargaining, ensuring you get the same effective value as waiting for your turn to propose. I believe it’s a fair proposal considering our respective costs of delay. What do you think?",Bob,2,

450000.0,550000.0,"Given our respective devaluation rates, I propose you receive $550000 and I receive $450000. This reflects a compromise, offering you a larger share while still recognizing my waiting cost. Let’s settle this amicably now.",Alice,3,

310345.0,689655.0,"Hi Alice, I understand our waiting costs are stacking up and both our effective values diminish further. To avoid extra losses from future rounds, I'm proposing the equilibrium division based on our discount factors: I get $689655 and you get $310345. This means you’d receive an effective value of roughly $226562—exactly the same as you’d expect to secure as proposer in the next round. I hope you agree that this is a fair offer given the circumstances, and that we can settle now.",Bob,4,
