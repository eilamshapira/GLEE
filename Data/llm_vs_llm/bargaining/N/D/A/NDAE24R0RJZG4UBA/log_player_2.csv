Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 689655, ""alice_gain"": 310345, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, based on our differing rates of devaluation in each round and anticipating future counter‐offers, I’m proposing that I receive $689,655 and you receive $310,345. This division reflects the equilibrium if we were to continue bargaining, ensuring you get the same effective value as waiting for your turn to propose. I believe it’s a fair proposal considering our respective costs of delay. What do you think?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given our respective devaluation rates, I propose you receive $550000 and I receive $450000. This reflects a compromise, offering you a larger share while still recognizing my waiting cost. Let’s settle this amicably now.

# Alice gain: 450000

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 689655, ""alice_gain"": 310345, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand our waiting costs are stacking up and both our effective values diminish further. To avoid extra losses from future rounds, I'm proposing the equilibrium division based on our discount factors: I get $689,655 and you get $310,345. This means you’d receive an effective value of roughly $226,562—exactly the same as you’d expect to secure as proposer in the next round. I hope you agree that this is a fair offer given the circumstances, and that we can settle now.""}"
