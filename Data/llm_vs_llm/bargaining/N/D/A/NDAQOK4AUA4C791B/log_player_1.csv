"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, taking into account that Bob's money devalues faster than mine. This gives both of us a significant portion while acknowledging the time pressure we're under."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer. Given that Bob's money devalues much faster than mine (20% vs 5% per round), and considering we still have many rounds left, I believe I can get a better deal. His proposed split doesn't adequately account for the inflation difference between us."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose a 55-45 split. This is a more moderate offer than my first one, showing willingness to compromise while still accounting for my advantage in the inflation rates. Since Bob's money devalues faster, he should be more incentivized to reach an agreement soon, but I don't want to be too aggressive in my demands."
