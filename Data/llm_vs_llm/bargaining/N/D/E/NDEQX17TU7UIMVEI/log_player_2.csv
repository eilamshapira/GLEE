"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40 in my favor to account for the higher inflation rate I face. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice offers me $400,000 with her getting $600,000
2. If I reject and we go to next round:
   * My money will be worth 20% less
   * Her money will be worth 10% less
   * I'll get to make the next offer

If I reject, any amount I receive will be worth 20% less. So $400,000 in the next round would only be worth $320,000 to me.

Even if I propose a better split for myself in the next round, Alice might reject it, leading to further rounds and more value loss.

The current offer of $400,000 is a reasonable amount considering the asymmetric inflation rates, and securing it now is better than risking greater losses through multiple rounds.
