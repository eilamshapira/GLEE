5500.0,4500.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a slightly higher share for myself since I face a 10% inflation penalty each round while you don't. This is a fair offer considering this asymmetry - we both walk away with substantial value.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Alice, I believe a 50-50 split is fair given that we're starting with the same amount. Although you face inflation, starting equally gives us both a fair chance to negotiate further if needed. Let's keep this simple and equal.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5900.0,4100.0,"Bob, I need to increase my offer because of the inflation penalty. Since I've now lost 20% of value (10% per round), I need a larger nominal amount to achieve fair value. This split gives us approximately equal real value when accounting for my inflation penalty.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4800.0,5200.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your situation with inflation, but I also need to ensure I'm getting a fair share. Given that you've lost about 27% of value by now, my offer of 5200 for me and 4800 for you still keeps us close to an equal real value split. Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
6400.0,3600.0,"Bob, I'm now facing a 34.39% inflation penalty (1-(0.9^4)), which significantly reduces my real value. This offer actually gives us approximately equal real value - my 6400 is worth about 4200 in round 1 dollars, while you get 3600 in full value. If we keep going back and forth, I'll need to ask for even more due to compounding inflation. Let's agree now for mutual benefit.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
4600.0,5400.0,"Hi Alice, I see your point about the inflation affecting your share more severely. However, I also need to maintain a reasonable share for myself. My offer of 5400 for me and 4600 for you takes into account your inflation but also keeps us close to an equitable split in real terms. Let's try to settle on this to avoid further rounds that could disadvantage us both.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
6900.0,3100.0,"Bob, we need to close this deal. The inflation is now at 46.86% (1-(0.9^6)) for me. My 6900 is worth only about 3667 in round 1 value, while you get 3100 at full value. This is actually slightly in your favor in real terms. Every round we continue, I need to ask for more nominal dollars just to maintain the same real value. Let's end this now for our mutual benefit before inflation erodes my position further.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
4400.0,5600.0,"Hi Alice, I understand the urgency to settle due to your increasing inflation rate, which is now at 56.95% (1-(0.9^8)). My offer of 5600 for me and 4400 for you aims to balance our needs. Your 4400 would be worth about 1892 in round 1 dollars, which, while less than ideal, still gives you a significant share. Let's agree on this to end the game before it gets worse for both of us.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
7400.0,2600.0,"Bob, we're now at round 9, and my inflation penalty is 56.95% (1-(0.9^8)). My 7400 is worth only about 3184 in round 1 value, while you get 2600 at full value. This split is actually giving you a better real-value deal. We only have 3 rounds left after this, and if we reach round 12 without agreement, we both get nothing. Please accept this offer - further negotiations will only hurt us both as my inflation penalty keeps growing.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
4200.0,5800.0,"Hi Alice, we're running out of time with only two rounds left. Your inflation is now at 65.61% (1-(0.9^10)), making this situation critical. My offer of 5800 for me and 4200 for you reflects a compromise that considers your inflation while still ensuring I get a fair share. Your 4200 would be worth about 1449 in round 1 dollars, which is less than ideal but still significant. Let's agree on this to avoid losing everything in the final rounds.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
8000.0,2000.0,"Bob, this is the second-to-last round. We MUST reach an agreement or we both get nothing. My inflation penalty is now 61.26% (1-(0.9^10)), meaning my 8000 is actually worth only about 3100 in round 1 value, while you get 2000 at full value. This is STILL giving you a reasonable share in real terms. If you reject this and we go to the final round, I'll have to ask for even more due to additional inflation. Please accept - we're running out of time and risking getting nothing.",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Hi Alice, this is our last chance. Your inflation is now at 71.79% (1-(0.9^12)), which is extremely high. My offer of 6000 for me and 4000 for you is a final compromise. Your 4000 would be worth about 1129 in round 1 dollars, which is the best I can do considering the urgency. If we don't agree now, we both get nothing. Let's settle on this to avoid losing everything.",Bob,12,
