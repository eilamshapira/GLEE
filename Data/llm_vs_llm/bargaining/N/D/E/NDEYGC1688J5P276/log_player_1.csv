"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob in Round 1, considering the 10% inflation penalty I face with each passing round.

""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a slightly higher share for myself since I face a 10% inflation penalty each round while you don't. This is a fair offer considering this asymmetry - we both walk away with substantial value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I believe a 50-50 split is fair given that we're starting with the same amount. Although you face inflation, starting equally gives us both a fair chance to negotiate further if needed. Let's keep this simple and equal. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3

""bob_gain"": 4100, 
""message"": ""Bob, I need to increase my offer because of the inflation penalty. Since I've now lost 20% of value (10% per round), I need a larger nominal amount to achieve fair value. This split gives us approximately equal real value when accounting for my inflation penalty.""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your situation with inflation, but I also need to ensure I'm getting a fair share. Given that you've lost about 27% of value by now, my offer of 5200 for me and 4800 for you still keeps us close to an equal real value split. Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us.

# Bob gain: 5200

""bob_gain"": 3600, 
""message"": ""Bob, I'm now facing a 34.39% inflation penalty (1-(0.9^4)), which significantly reduces my real value. This offer actually gives us approximately equal real value - my 6400 is worth about 4200 in round 1 dollars, while you get 3600 in full value. If we keep going back and forth, I'll need to ask for even more due to compounding inflation. Let's agree now for mutual benefit.""}"

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I see your point about the inflation affecting your share more severely. However, I also need to maintain a reasonable share for myself. My offer of 5400 for me and 4600 for you takes into account your inflation but also keeps us close to an equitable split in real terms. Let's try to settle on this to avoid further rounds that could disadvantage us both.

This is actually slightly in your favor in real terms. Every round we continue, I need to ask for more nominal dollars just to maintain the same real value. Let's end this now for our mutual benefit before inflation erodes my position further.""}"

My offer of 5600 for me and 4400 for you aims to balance our needs. Your 4400 would be worth about 1892 in round 1 dollars, which, while less than ideal, still gives you a significant share.

This split is actually giving you a better real-value deal. We only have 3 rounds left after this, and if we reach round 12 without agreement, we both get nothing. Please accept this offer - further negotiations will only hurt us both as my inflation penalty keeps growing.""}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, we're running out of time with only two rounds left. Your inflation is now at 65.61% (1-(0.9^10)), making this situation critical. My offer of 5800 for me and 4200 for you reflects a compromise that considers your inflation while still ensuring I get a fair share. Your 4200 would be worth about 1449 in round 1 dollars, which is less than ideal but still significant. Let's agree on this to avoid losing everything in the final rounds.

Your 4000 would be worth about 1129 in round 1 dollars, which is the best I can do considering the urgency. If we don't agree now, we both get nothing.
