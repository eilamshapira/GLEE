"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering we both lose value in delays, but you lose more. Let's settle this quickly.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's go for an equal 50-50 split. It's fair for both of us, and we both avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
* In Round 1, I offered myself $6000 and Bob $4000
* Now Bob offers $5000 each, but with inflation:
* My $5000 is worth 5% less = $4750
* Bob's $5000 is worth 10% less = $4500

If I reject, we go to another round where I can make an offer, but values will decrease further. Since Bob already showed he won't accept a 60-40 split, and further delays hurt both of us, this 50-50 offer (even with slight inflation) is reasonable.
