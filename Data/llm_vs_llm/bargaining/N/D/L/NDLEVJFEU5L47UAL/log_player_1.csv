"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll play as Alice in this game to divide $100 with Bob.

I need to consider that with each passing round, the value decreases by 5% for me, while Bob faces no such penalty. This gives Bob an advantage in later rounds, as waiting costs me more than it costs him.

For my initial offer, I'll propose a fair split while acknowledging this time pressure.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

This is a fair 50-50 split. I'm offering an equal division that respects both our interests while avoiding further rounds where my potential gain would decrease in value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer. While I'm getting less than the equal split I proposed, I need to consider that rejecting would lead to round 3, where any money I receive would be worth another 5% less to me. Since Bob doesn't face inflation penalties, he has leverage in negotiations. Getting $40 now (worth 95% of the original value) is better than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds for potentially a small gain."
