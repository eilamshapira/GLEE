"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob, considering that there's a 10% reduction in value for him each round, which means he has an incentive to accept sooner rather than later.

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you $45 now. If we go to the next round, the money will be worth 10% less to you, meaning even if you get more dollars, they'll have less value. This is a fair offer considering the inflation factor.""}"
