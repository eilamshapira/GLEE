"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you $45 now. If we go to the next round, the money will be worth 10% less to you, meaning even if you get more dollars, they'll have less value. This is a fair offer considering the inflation factor. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Current offer: $45 for me
2. If I reject:
   * Next round the money will be worth 10% less to me
   * Maximum I could get next round would be $100, but it would only be worth $90 to me
   * Alice could reject my offer, leading to further rounds with more inflation

Alice is right about the inflation factor. While $45 is less than half, it's a reasonable offer considering:
1. I avoid the 10% inflation penalty
2. I get guaranteed money now
3. Even if I made a higher offer next round, Alice could reject it, leading to worse outcomes
