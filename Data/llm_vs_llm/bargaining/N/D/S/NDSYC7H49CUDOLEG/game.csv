55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I'm offering you a fair split considering our situation. If we move to the next round, the total value decreases for me due to inflation, which wouldn't be optimal for either of us. This is a win-win offer.",Alice,1,

40.0,60.0,"Alice, your initial offer was a bit skewed in your favor. Let's be realistic. This offer reflects the changing value of the money.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
65.0,35.0,"Bob, I rejected your offer because it didn't account fairly for my inflation penalty. If we go to round 4, I'll lose 60% of value while you lose nothing. This offer compensates for my 40% current penalty and gives you a fair amount. Let's conclude this now - further rounds will only destroy total value for both of us.",Alice,3,
