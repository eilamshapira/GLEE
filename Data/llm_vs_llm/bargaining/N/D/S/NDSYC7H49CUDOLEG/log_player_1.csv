"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I need to think strategically about this. Since I'm going first, I should offer a proposal that's favorable to both of us, but considers the fact that I face a 20% penalty if we go to the next round.

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a fair split considering our situation. If we move to the next round, the total value decreases for me due to inflation, which wouldn't be optimal for either of us. This is a win-win offer.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer was a bit skewed in your favor. Let's be realistic. This offer reflects the changing value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I need to be strategic here. The money is now worth 40% less to me than in round 1, so I need to account for that in my offer.

{""alice_gain"": 65, 
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Bob, I rejected your offer because it didn't account fairly for my inflation penalty. If we go to round 4, I'll lose 60% of value while you lose nothing. This offer compensates for my 40% current penalty and gives you a fair amount. Let's conclude this now - further rounds will only destroy total value for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's stop wasting time.  A 50/50 split is the only fair outcome at this point. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
