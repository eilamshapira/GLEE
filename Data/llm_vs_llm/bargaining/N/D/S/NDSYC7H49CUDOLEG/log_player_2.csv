"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a fair split considering our situation. If we move to the next round, the total value decreases for me due to inflation, which wouldn't be optimal for either of us. This is a win-win offer. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's see how Alice reacts to a counter-offer.  The inflation works in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer was a bit skewed in your favor. Let's be realistic. This offer reflects the changing value of the money.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I rejected your offer because it didn't account fairly for my inflation penalty. If we go to round 4, I'll lose 60% of value while you lose nothing. This offer compensates for my 40% current penalty and gives you a fair amount. Let's conclude this now - further rounds will only destroy total value for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is exaggerating her losses to pressure me. I'll hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time.  A 50/50 split is the only fair outcome at this point.""}"
