"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $4,000 and she gets $6,000 of the $10,000 total. If I reject and we go to another round, I'll face 20% inflation on my share, meaning my money would be worth 20% less. 

If I counter-offer in the next round, the maximum $10,000 would only be worth $8,000 to me due to inflation. Even if I then proposed a more favorable split, this inflation effect is significant.
