55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I'm offering a fair split that slightly favors me as the first mover. If we keep delaying, we both lose due to inflation, but you lose faster (10% vs my 5%). This is a good deal for both of us to conclude quickly.",Alice,1,

50.0,50.0,"Alice, considering the inflation, I think an equal split is fair for both of us. This way, we both get the same amount, and we can conclude the game without losing more value.",Bob,2,

60.0,40.0,"Bob, I understand you want an equal split, but our inflation rates are different. My money loses 5% value per round while yours loses 10%, which means delaying hurts you more than me. This offer reflects that reality - if we keep going, your position weakens faster than mine. Let's conclude now with this fair adjustment.",Alice,3,

52.0,48.0,"Alice, I understand your point about the inflation rates, but I still think your offer is too skewed in your favor. I'm willing to compromise and accept a slightly smaller share, but I won't go as low as 40. This offer is a more reasonable adjustment, considering the inflation difference.",Bob,4,

58.0,42.0,"Bob, I've adjusted my offer to be more favorable to you. Let's be practical - with each round, we're both losing money, but you're losing more due to the 10% inflation rate. At this point, you've already lost over 27% of value, while I've lost about 14%. If we go to round 7, you'll have lost almost 40% of your value! This 58/42 split actually makes mathematical sense given our different inflation rates. Please accept so we can both stop losing money.",Alice,5,
