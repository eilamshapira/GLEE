"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob for the first round, considering the inflation rates and the limited number of rounds.

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a fair split that slightly favors me as the first mover. If we keep delaying, we both lose due to inflation, but you lose faster (10% vs my 5%). This is a good deal for both of us to conclude quickly.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the inflation, I think an equal split is fair for both of us. This way, we both get the same amount, and we can conclude the game without losing more value. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you want an equal split, but our inflation rates are different. My money loses 5% value per round while yours loses 10%, which means delaying hurts you more than me. This offer reflects that reality - if we keep going, your position weakens faster than mine. Let's conclude now with this fair adjustment.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your point about the inflation rates, but I still think your offer is too skewed in your favor. I'm willing to compromise and accept a slightly smaller share, but I won't go as low as 40. This offer is a more reasonable adjustment, considering the inflation difference. 
# Alice gain: 52 
# Bob gain: 48

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58,
""bob_gain"": 42,
""message"": ""Bob, I've adjusted my offer to be more favorable to you. Let's be practical - with each round, we're both losing money, but you're losing more due to the 10% inflation rate. At this point, you've already lost over 27% of value, while I've lost about 14%. If we go to round 7, you'll have lost almost 40% of your value! This 58/42 split actually makes mathematical sense given our different inflation rates. Please accept so we can both stop losing money.""}"
