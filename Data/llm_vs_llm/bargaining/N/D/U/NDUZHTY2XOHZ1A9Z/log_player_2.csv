"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering a fair split that slightly favors me as the first mover. If we keep delaying, we both lose due to inflation, but you lose faster (10% vs my 5%). This is a good deal for both of us to conclude quickly. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Alice, considering the inflation, I think an equal split is fair for both of us. This way, we both get the same amount, and we can conclude the game without losing more value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want an equal split, but our inflation rates are different. My money loses 5% value per round while yours loses 10%, which means delaying hurts you more than me. This offer reflects that reality - if we keep going, your position weakens faster than mine. Let's conclude now with this fair adjustment. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 48, 
""alice_gain"": 52, 
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your point about the inflation rates, but I still think your offer is too skewed in your favor. I'm willing to compromise and accept a slightly smaller share, but I won't go as low as 40. This offer is a more reasonable adjustment, considering the inflation difference.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I've adjusted my offer to be more favorable to you. Let's be practical - with each round, we're both losing money, but you're losing more due to the 10% inflation rate. At this point, you've already lost over 27% of value, while I've lost about 14%. If we go to round 7, you'll have lost almost 40% of your value! This 58/42 split actually makes mathematical sense given our different inflation rates. Please accept so we can both stop losing money. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58
