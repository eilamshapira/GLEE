"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering me $45 while taking $55 for herself. If I reject, we'll move to round 2 where I can make a counter-offer, but the total amount will be worth 5% less (only $95 total to divide).

While her offer isn't perfectly equal, it's close enough that pursuing a better deal might not be worth the 5% inflation penalty. If I reject and we keep negotiating, we could both end up with less.
