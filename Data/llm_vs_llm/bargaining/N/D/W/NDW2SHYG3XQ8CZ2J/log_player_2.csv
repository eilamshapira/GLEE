"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $4,000 while she takes $6,000. While it's not an even split, if I reject it, the total amount will decrease by 10% in the next round (down to $9,000 total). Even if I manage to get a better percentage in the next round, I might end up with less money in absolute terms.

However, I believe I can get a better deal even accounting for the 10% inflation. By rejecting this offer, I can make my own proposal next round and aim for a more equitable split.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split, but slightly in my favor since Alice already demonstrated she's willing to consider uneven splits. I'll also keep it simple and straightforward.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice's offering me $4,200, which due to 19% inflation is actually worth about $3,402 in round 1 terms
2. If I reject, we go to round 4, where the inflation will be 29% (another 10% loss)
3. My previous offer of 5500/4500 was rejected, showing Alice won't accept being in the minority
4. Further delays will keep eroding the real value of any deal

While this offer is still giving Alice more than me, it's more balanced than her first offer, and the inflation is making time work against both of us. Getting $3,402 in real terms is better than risking further rounds of inflation.
