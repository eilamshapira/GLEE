"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, 50-50 split. What do you say, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

With Alice offering a 50-50 split:
1. If I accept now, I get $50
2. If I reject, in the next round the money will be worth 5% less to me, but I can make a counter-offer
3. The fair split shows Alice is starting with a cooperative approach
4. Since Alice's money devalues faster (10% vs my 5%), I might get a better deal later, but it's risky

Given that:
- This is a fair opening offer
- The value decreases each round
- There's no guarantee of a better deal later
- Building goodwill early might be valuable

I'll accept this offer.
