Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Fair 60-40 split""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every round you wait costs you 10% of your share. If you reject, you'll end up with only about 80% of 10000 in round 3. Accept this offer now and secure 0.9 × 8889 ≈ 8000 in effective value, which is as good as it gets. 
# Alice gain: 8889 
# Bob gain: 1111 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
