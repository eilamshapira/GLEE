6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and it's better to decide early before inflation reduces the value for both of us.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Hi Alice, let's split 55-45. It's a fairer deal considering the inflation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6500.0,3500.0,"Bob, due to the higher inflation rate affecting me (20% per round) compared to your 10%, I need a larger nominal amount to reach a fair effective value. This split helps balance the real value we each receive after inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, let's be realistic. We both lose with these games. I propose a 50/50 split to end this fairly. ",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
7000.0,3000.0,"Bob, let's do the math: Due to compounding inflation, my money is now worth 59% less while yours only 34.4% less. A 70-30 split would result in roughly equal real values after inflation. This is fair and we should agree now before inflation erodes more value.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Alice, this is my final offer.  A 45/55 split acknowledges the inflation impact, but doesn't unfairly punish me.  We need to settle this now before we both lose out.",Bob,6,
