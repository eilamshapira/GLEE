"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and it's better to decide early before inflation reduces the value for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's split 55-45. It's a fairer deal considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The value of my $4500 would only be worth $3600 due to the 20% inflation, while Bob's $5500 is worth $4950 with his 10% inflation. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round that better accounts for the inflation difference."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6500, 
""bob_gain"": 3500, 
""message"": ""Bob, due to the higher inflation rate affecting me (20% per round) compared to your 10%, I need a larger nominal amount to reach a fair effective value. This split helps balance the real value we each receive after inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic. We both lose with these games. I propose a 50/50 split to end this fairly.  
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Due to the compounding inflation differences (my 48.8% vs Bob's 27.1%), a 50-50 split in nominal terms is actually quite unfair. My $5000 would only be worth $2560 after inflation, while Bob's $5000 would be worth $3645. I'll make a counter-offer that better accounts for these inflation differences."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7000, 
""bob_gain"": 3000, 
""message"": ""Bob, let's do the math: Due to compounding inflation, my money is now worth 59% less while yours only 34.4% less. A 70-30 split would result in roughly equal real values after inflation. This is fair and we should agree now before inflation erodes more value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer.  A 45/55 split acknowledges the inflation impact, but doesn't unfairly punish me.  We need to settle this now before we both lose out. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

While not ideal, I'll accept this offer. With current inflation rates, my $5500 will be worth about $1802 after the 67.23% inflation, and Bob's $4500 will be worth about $2657 after his 40.95% inflation. If we continue negotiating, the compounding inflation will reduce my purchasing power even further, making future deals potentially worse for me. It's better to secure this deal now."
