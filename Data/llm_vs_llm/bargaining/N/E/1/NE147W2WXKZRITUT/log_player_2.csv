"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and it's better to decide early before inflation reduces the value for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, let's split 55-45. It's a fairer deal considering the inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, due to the higher inflation rate affecting me (20% per round) compared to your 10%, I need a larger nominal amount to reach a fair effective value. This split helps balance the real value we each receive after inflation. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Alice claims a higher inflation rate, her offer is still heavily skewed in her favor.  I'm willing to negotiate, but not be taken advantage of."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. We both lose with these games. I propose a 50/50 split to end this fairly. ""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's do the math: Due to compounding inflation, my money is now worth 59% less while yours only 34.4% less. A 70-30 split would result in roughly equal real values after inflation. This is fair and we should agree now before inflation erodes more value. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is getting ridiculous. Alice's claims of a 20% personal inflation rate are highly suspect and she's using it as a bargaining tactic. I'm sticking to a fair split, but I need to be ready to accept a less favorable deal soon before inflation eats up too much of my potential gains."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer.  A 45/55 split acknowledges the inflation impact, but doesn't unfairly punish me.  We need to settle this now before we both lose out.""}"
