"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I need to make an offer to Bob, keeping in mind the diminishing value of the money with each round. I'll start with a proposal that is favorable to me, but still gives Bob a reasonable share, hoping he'll accept to avoid the value decreasing.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I see Bob's counter-offer. Let's analyze this.

*   **My perspective:** If I accept, I get $450,000. Due to inflation, this is worth $450,000 * 0.9 = $405,000 in terms of round 1 value.
*   **If I reject:** I risk further inflation.

While I'd prefer a higher share, the decreasing value of the money is a serious concern. Bob's offer is not terrible. Given the risk of further losses, I'll accept this offer.
