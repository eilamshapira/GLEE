"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
- She's offering me $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for herself
- If I reject, we go to next round where:
  * My money would be worth 5% less
  * Her money would be worth 10% less
  * I get to make the next offer

While her offer isn't a 50-50 split, it's not terrible. However, given that her money devalues faster than mine (10% vs 5%), I have some leverage to negotiate for a better deal by rejecting this first offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that Alice's money devalues faster than mine (10% vs 5% per round), I'll propose a more favorable split for me, but still reasonable enough that she might accept rather than risk further devaluation.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because:
1. It gives me a better deal than her initial offer
2. For Alice, accepting 450000 now is better than getting the same amount or slightly more later due to her 10% devaluation rate
3. It's not so extreme that it would appear unfair or trigger automatic rejection"
