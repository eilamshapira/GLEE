"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Split it evenly, no need to wait""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's make a deal.  I'll take a bit more, you still get a good chunk now. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $400,000, but its value will be 10% less than in the previous round, so it's effectively worth $400,000 * 0.9 = $360,000 to me.

I think I can do better than that. My response is:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less to me in each round, and this is the 3rd round, its value will be 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 of the original value.

I'll make a new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""My turn, slightly in my favor, let's end this""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: How about we swap from your last offer?  We both save time and avoid more losses. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is proposing to swap the amounts from my previous offer. Considering the inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $450,000, but its value will be 27.1% less than in the first round, so it's effectively worth $450,000 * 0.729 = $328,050 to me.

I think this is a reasonable offer, and I don't want to risk losing more value due to inflation. My response is:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
