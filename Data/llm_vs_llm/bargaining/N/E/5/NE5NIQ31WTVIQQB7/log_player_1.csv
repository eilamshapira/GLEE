Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""I propose a fair split of 50/50. Since we're both facing inflation, let's agree to this equal division now so we both get maximum value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want an even split, but the inflation hits me harder. Let's be fair to each other: I'll take a bit more this round, and we can split evenly if there's a next one. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
