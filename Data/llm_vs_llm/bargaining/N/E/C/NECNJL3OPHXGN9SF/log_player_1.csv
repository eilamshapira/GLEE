"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer for the first round of our negotiation game.

{""alice_gain"": 510000, ""bob_gain"": 490000}

I propose a slight advantage for myself at 51% of the total, which I believe is fair given that inflation will reduce the value of future settlements for me by 5% per round. This split gives Bob a substantial portion while allowing me to protect against some of the inflation risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer of a 50-50 split. While this is worth 5% less to me than a similar offer would have been in round 1, it's still better than continuing to another round where inflation would reduce my purchasing power even further. The 500,000 I receive now is worth more to me than potentially getting a slightly higher nominal amount in a future round."
