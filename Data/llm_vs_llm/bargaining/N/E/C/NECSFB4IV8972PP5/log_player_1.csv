"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that I'm playing as Alice and this is the first round, I need to make an offer to divide $10,000. I should consider the inflation rates: my money loses 20% value each round, while Bob's loses 10% value per round. This means I have a stronger incentive to reach an agreement quickly.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose an even split of $5,000 each. This is a fair starting point that respects both our interests and gives us both equal shares of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer since Bob is asking for a significantly larger share. We can still reach a better compromise, especially considering that I have a higher inflation rate and we still have many rounds left to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that inflation is compounding (I'm now facing 20% inflation twice), I need to be more strategic while still seeking a fair deal.

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a bit more than an even split while still securing a reasonable amount for myself. Since I face higher inflation (20% vs. Bob's 10%), reaching an agreement sooner is in my interest, but I still deserve a fair portion of the total."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting this offer as Bob continues to push for an increasingly uneven split in his favor. While I understand the impact of the different inflation rates, the current offer is too imbalanced."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With inflation accumulating significantly (my money is now worth almost 50% less than in round 1), I need to be more accommodating while still trying to secure a reasonable deal.

{""alice_gain"": 4250, ""bob_gain"": 5750}

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob more than my previous offer, recognizing our different inflation rates and the fact that we're now in round 5. This is a reasonable compromise that acknowledges Bob's negotiating position while still giving me a fair portion of the total."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting this offer despite the increasing inflation pressure. Bob's offer of 7000 to 3000 is still too imbalanced. We have 6 more rounds remaining, so there's still room to negotiate a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With inflation severely impacting my potential gains (now worth about 67% less than in round 1), I need to be more conciliatory while still advocating for a somewhat fair distribution.

{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000}

I'm now willing to accept a 60-40 split in Bob's favor. This acknowledges our different inflation pressures and the fact that we're now in round 7. This represents a significant concession from my initial position while still maintaining a reasonable share for myself."
