"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $40 while she takes $60. Given that we have 12 rounds maximum, and my money loses 5% value each round if I reject, I should calculate whether waiting for a better offer makes sense.

If I reject now and make a counter-offer next round, the total value will already be worth 5% less to me. So even if I proposed a 50-50 split next round and Alice accepted, I'd get $50 but it would be worth only $47.50 to me due to the 5% inflation.

While Alice's offer isn't perfectly equal, $40 now is better than risking further negotiations with increasing inflation penalties.
