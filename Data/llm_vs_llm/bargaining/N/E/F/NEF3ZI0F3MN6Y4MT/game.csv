737856.0,262144.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we split $1000000 as $737856 for me and $262144 for you. Given that any delay will cost you 20% per round while my share remains unaffected, this offer matches what you’d get if you waited for your turn. I believe this is fair and efficient for both of us – let’s settle now!",Alice,1,
