Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split $1000000 as $737856 for me and $262144 for you. Given that any delay will cost you 20% per round while my share remains unaffected, this offer matches what you’d get if you waited for your turn. I believe this is fair and efficient for both of us – let’s settle now! 
# Bob gain: 262144 
# Alice gain: 737856
