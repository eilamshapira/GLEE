"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair offer that accounts for the inflation effect. Since I know my money will be worth 10% less each round, I'll propose a slightly favorable split for me in the first round.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm offering you $45, Bob. This is a fair division considering that if we delay, the total value decreases due to inflation. Let's finalize this now so we both benefit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I notice that Bob is proposing splits that favor himself, similar to what I initially proposed. Since inflation affects me more strongly than Bob (10% vs 5% per round), I need to be strategic while also moving toward a resolution.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

Bob, I'm proposing an even 50-50 split. This is completely fair and allows us both to walk away with equal amounts. The longer we negotiate, the more we both lose to inflation, especially me. Let's agree on this balanced solution and end the game now."
