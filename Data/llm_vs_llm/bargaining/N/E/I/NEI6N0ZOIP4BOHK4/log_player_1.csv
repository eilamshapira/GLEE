"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50-50 split would be more fair. This gives us each $5000, which is an equitable division. Since inflation doesn't affect me, I can negotiate patiently, but I'm offering you a reasonable equal split right now to conclude our negotiation efficiently. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

From my perspective, due to 10% inflation, the $5000 offered is actually worth $4500 to me. Bob knows he's not affected by inflation and is using this as leverage.

While this is less than my initial proposal would have given me, if I reject and we go to another round, my next offer would be worth even less to me due to inflation. Even if I propose a higher split in my favor next round, Bob might reject again, knowing time is on his side.

Given these circumstances, accepting now is likely better than continuing negotiations with diminishing value.
