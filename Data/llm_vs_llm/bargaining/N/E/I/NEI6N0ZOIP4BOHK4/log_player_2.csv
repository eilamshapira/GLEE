"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering I'm making the first move, and you get a solid $4000 right away without risking inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I receive $4,000 while she takes $6,000. She argues this is fair since she's making the first move.

Since the instructions mention that inflation doesn't affect me (0% inflation for me), there's no financial risk in rejecting and making a counter-offer in the next round. However, I don't know how inflation affects Alice, which could give me some leverage.

Given that there's no downside for me to negotiate further, and I could potentially get a more favorable split, I'll reject this offer and make my own proposal in the next round.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50-50 split would be more fair. This gives us each $5,000, which is an equitable division. Since inflation doesn't affect me, I can negotiate patiently, but I'm offering you a reasonable equal split right now to conclude our negotiation efficiently.""}"
