"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Current value for me: $400,000
2. If I reject, next round I can make an offer, but the money will be worth 20% less
3. So next round, even if I got the full amount, it would be worth $800,000 to me
4. The current offer gives me a guaranteed $400,000

While I could try to negotiate for more, the risk of losing value due to inflation and potential further negotiations makes this a decent offer. It's not ideal, but it's a reasonable starting point.
