"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'm offering a 51/49 split.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 49 
# Alice gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing I get $49 while she gets $51. If I reject and move to the next round, I'd need to propose a better split for myself, but the money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation. That means the full $100 would only be worth $80 to me in the next round.

Looking at the current offer: $49 now is better than even getting $50 in the next round (which would only be worth $40 to me after inflation).
