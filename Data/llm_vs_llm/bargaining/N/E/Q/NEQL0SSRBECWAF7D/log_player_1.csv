"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to account for the decreasing value of the money for both myself and Bob as the rounds progress. I also want to secure a deal early to avoid further losses.

Here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

My reasoning:

*   I'm offering Bob a significant portion (40%) to incentivize him to accept the deal early.
*   I'm prioritizing securing 60% for myself now, rather than risking lower gains in later rounds due to inflation. This feels like a reasonable starting point given the power dynamics of being the first proposer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the inflation before making my decision.

*   **My perspective:** Accepting 45 now is equivalent to 45 \* 0.95 = 42.75 in round 1 dollars.
*   **Bob's perspective:** Bob getting 55 now is equivalent to 55 \* 0.90 = 49.5 in round 1 dollars.

Even with inflation, Bob is offering more to himself than he offered to me in round 1. While the 45 seems low, I need to consider how much worse it could get if I reject.

Let's see... If I reject, the next round's money will be worth even less. Given that Bob is already starting with a larger portion, I think it is worth accepting this offer.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
