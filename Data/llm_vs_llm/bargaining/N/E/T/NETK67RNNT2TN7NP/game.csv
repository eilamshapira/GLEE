4500.0,5500.0,"Hi Alice, considering the inflation impact on my side, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This way, we both get a reasonable amount, and I can mitigate some of the inflation effects. Let's agree on this and end the game soon.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, let's meet in the middle. A 55-45 split in my favor accounts for the current inflation impact on my side while still giving you a substantial amount. If we continue negotiating, both of us will lose more value to inflation. Let's conclude this now.",Alice,3,

5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, given the rapid decrease in value due to inflation on my side, I'm proposing a 50-50 split. This is fair and equitable, considering we're now in round 4 and the money's value is significantly reduced for me. Let's agree on this to end the game and secure what we can before it's worth even less.",Bob,4,
