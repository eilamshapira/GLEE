"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get your money immediately without any inflation impact.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation impact on my side, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This way, we both get a reasonable amount, and I can mitigate some of the inflation effects. Let's agree on this and end the game soon. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Reasoning (not part of response): With 20% inflation, my $4500 would be worth $3600 in round 1 terms. I can make a better counter-offer in the next round, even accounting for further inflation, as Bob seems concerned about inflation on his side too. This suggests we might find a mutually beneficial agreement soon."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Bob, let's meet in the middle. A 55-45 split in my favor accounts for the current inflation impact on my side while still giving you a substantial amount. If we continue negotiating, both of us will lose more value to inflation. Let's conclude this now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, given the rapid decrease in value due to inflation on my side, I'm proposing a 50-50 split. This is fair and equitable, considering we're now in round 4 and the money's value is significantly reduced for me. Let's agree on this to end the game and secure what we can before it's worth even less. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Reasoning (not part of response): While my $5000 is worth only about $2560 in round 1 terms due to the 48.8% inflation, continuing to negotiate would lead to even greater value loss. Bob seems to be experiencing similar inflation pressure, and a 50-50 split is a fair compromise at this point. Further rounds would only erode the value more, so it's better to secure this amount now."
