Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get your money immediately without any inflation impact.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's meet in the middle. A 55-45 split in my favor accounts for the current inflation impact on my side while still giving you a substantial amount. If we continue negotiating, both of us will lose more value to inflation. Let's conclude this now. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500

This is fair and equitable, considering we're now in round 4 and the money's value is significantly reduced for me. Let's agree on this to end the game and secure what we can before it's worth even less.""}"
