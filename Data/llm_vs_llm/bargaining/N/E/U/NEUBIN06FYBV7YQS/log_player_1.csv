"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split, offering slightly more to Bob to encourage acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}

I propose to give Bob $55 and keep $45 for myself. This is a generous first offer that acknowledges Bob's position while still ensuring I get a reasonable share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer:
- For me: $40 (full value)
- For Bob: $60 (but worth only $57 due to 5% inflation)

While this offer gives me less than my initial proposal, rejecting it means facing another round of inflation for Bob, which might make future negotiations more difficult. However, I believe I can get a better deal, and Bob still has room to lose value due to inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that Bob's money is now worth 10% less due to inflation (2 rounds passed), I should adjust my offer to account for this while still making it attractive enough for Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 48, ""bob_gain"": 52}

I propose to give Bob $52 (which is worth $46.80 to him due to 10% inflation) and keep $48 for myself. This is still a reasonable split considering the inflation effect, and it improves my position while keeping the offer attractive enough for Bob to potentially accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
- For me: $35 (full value)
- For Bob: $65 (but worth only $55.73 due to 14.26% inflation)

This offer is worse for me than the previous ones, and Bob is actually getting less real value than what I offered in the last round despite asking for more nominal dollars. With several rounds still remaining and Bob's value continuing to decrease due to inflation, I believe I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Now Bob's money is worth 19.26% less (5 rounds of 5% compound inflation). I'll adjust my offer accordingly, aiming for a split that looks more favorable to Bob nominally while accounting for the inflation impact.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose a 50-50 split. While this looks like an even split nominally, due to the 19.26% inflation, Bob's $50 is actually worth about $40.37 to him. This is a reasonable offer considering the inflation effect, and it gives me a fair share while still giving Bob a significant portion. The simple 50-50 split might also appeal psychologically despite the real-value difference."
