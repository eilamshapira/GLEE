"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically:

1. Current offer: $4000 for me, $6000 for Alice
2. If I reject, in the next round:
   * I can make a counter-offer
   * But the money will be worth 20% less to me and 10% less to Alice
   * My $4000 would become worth $3200
   * Alice's $6000 would become worth $5400

While the split isn't perfectly equal (40/60), making a counter-offer would reduce the total value significantly. Even if I could negotiate a better percentage in the next round, the absolute value I'd receive might be lower due to the steep 20% inflation penalty I face.

Therefore, I'll accept this offer. While not ideal, it's a reasonable split and the inflation penalty makes waiting risky.
