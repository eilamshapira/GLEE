"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose an equal 50-50 split of the million dollars. This gives us both a fair share without needing to continue to further rounds. Since the money doesn't lose value for me over time, I'm happy to settle this fairly right now. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Alice offers a 50-50 split ($500,000 each)
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 20% less to me in the next round
3. In the next round, the maximum I could get would be $800,000, but due to 20% inflation, that would only be worth $640,000 to me
4. If Alice rejects my offer in the next round, the subsequent round would have even more severe inflation for me

Given that $500,000 now is worth more to me than a potential larger amount in future rounds (due to inflation), and considering this is a fair split, I should accept this offer.
