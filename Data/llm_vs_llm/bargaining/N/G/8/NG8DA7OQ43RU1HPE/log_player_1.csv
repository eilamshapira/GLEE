Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since we're now dealing with 80% of the original value, I'm proposing an even 50/50 split of the original amount. This is the fairest solution and gives us both $5000. If we continue negotiating, we'll both lose more money to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
