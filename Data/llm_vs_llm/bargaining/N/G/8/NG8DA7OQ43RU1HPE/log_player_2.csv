"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly with a slight advantage to me. Accept and we both win! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 60/40 split in her favor, where she gets $6,000 and I get $4,000. While not an even split, I need to remember:

1) If I reject, we move to the next round where I can make a counter-offer
2) However, the money loses 20% of its value (down to $8,000 total)
3) We only have 12 rounds before we both get nothing

Since I'll get to make the next offer if I reject, and the total drops to $8,000 (meaning I could propose getting more than $4,000 despite the devaluation), I'll reject this first offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a fair offer to Alice that accounts for the 20% inflation that has already occurred.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, since we're now dealing with 80% of the original value, I'm proposing an even 50/50 split of the original amount. This is the fairest solution and gives us both $5,000. If we continue negotiating, we'll both lose more money to inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given the inflation, I'm offering a slight adjustment. This way, we both get a fair share while considering the decreasing value. Let's agree on this before we lose more to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to analyze this offer carefully. 

Alice is now proposing I get $4,500 and she gets $5,500. The total has not decreased in nominal terms, but with 36% inflation from the first round, the real value is lower. This is a slight improvement from her first offer of 60/40 to a 55/45 split in her favor.

If I reject:
1) We move to round 4 (with 48% total inflation from the start)
2) I get to make the next offer
3) But we lose more value to inflation

Since Alice has moved toward a more balanced split, and continued negotiation will cost us both through inflation, I'll accept this offer.
