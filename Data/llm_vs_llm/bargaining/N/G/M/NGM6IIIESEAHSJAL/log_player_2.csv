"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether I should accept this offer, I need to consider the value of the money in the current round and the potential value in future rounds, taking into account the 10% decrease for me.

In Round 1, the total amount is $10,000, and Alice offers me $4,500 while keeping $5,500 for herself.

Given that the money decreases by 10% in value for me with each round, I should consider whether accepting $4,500 now is better than potentially getting more in a later round, albeit with decreased value.

However, since this is the first round and I don't have a basis for comparison yet, and considering the significant difference in value retention between Alice and me, I should aim to secure a reasonable amount early on to mitigate the effects of inflation on my potential earnings.

Considering these factors, I decide to reject the offer in hopes of getting a better deal or making a more favorable proposal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, it's now my turn to make a proposal. Considering the 10% decrease in value for me with each passing round, I want to make an offer that is reasonable for both of us but also takes into account the decreasing value of the money for me.

Given that the money is worth 10% less for me in this round compared to the previous one, I'll aim for a slightly more favorable split to compensate for the potential loss in value over time.

My offer for Round 2 is:
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800}

This offer gives me a bit more than half, considering the inflation factor that affects me but not Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that Alice rejected my offer in Round 2, she now makes a new proposal in Round 3. 

Considering the inflation factor, the money I would gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. This means if I were to gain $4,600, its actual value to me would be $4,600 * 0.81 = $3,726.

Alice's offer gives her $5,400, which is worth the full amount to her since she's not affected by inflation.

Comparing this to my initial rejection of her offer in Round 1, where I would have gotten $4,500 (worth $4,500 to me at that time), I now have to consider the decreased value due to inflation.

Given the decreasing value of the money for me and the fact that I need to secure a deal before the value drops further, I should evaluate whether accepting this offer is better than risking further decreases in value.

However, since Alice's new offer of $4,600 for me is only slightly more than my adjusted value consideration from her initial offer, and considering I'm already facing a 19% decrease in value, I might want to hold out for a potentially better offer or make a counteroffer that reflects the inflation impact more favorably for me.

But, considering the risk of further value decrease and the fact that I don't know how Alice will react to future proposals, I decide to accept this offer to secure some value rather than risking getting less in later rounds.
