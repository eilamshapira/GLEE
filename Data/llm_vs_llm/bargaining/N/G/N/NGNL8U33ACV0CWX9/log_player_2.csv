"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer and the impact of potential inflation on our gains if I reject.

If I reject, we go to Round 2 where I make the offer. But due to inflation, the money will be worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Alice. This means in Round 2, the $100 would effectively be worth $80 for me and $90 for Alice.

Alice's current offer gives me $50, which is fair in terms of equal division. If I reject and propose in Round 2, even if I asked for more than half, the value reduction would likely leave me worse off.
