"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split, let's be reasonable 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me 400,000$ in the first round. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer, but the money will be worth 5% less. However, 60-40 split in Alice's favor seems a bit unfair when we should be equal partners.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split, but still keeping it reasonable to encourage acceptance.

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. This is the most equitable solution for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer: 58-42, meeting you halfway from my initial offer 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Alice has moved from 60-40 to 58-42, showing some willingness to negotiate
2. Due to 9.75% inflation, the $420,000 offer is actually worth about $379,050 to me
3. If I reject, the next round will have even more inflation (14.5%)
4. Alice seems to be taking a firm but slightly flexible negotiating stance
5. We still have 9 rounds left, but the inflation is making each round costlier for me

While I'd prefer a better split, the inflation is significantly eating into my potential gains. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush.
