"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer to divide the $10,000, keeping in mind that with each round, the money is worth 10% less to me due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split because it's fair while accounting for the time pressure I face from inflation. Since the money loses 10% of its value for me each round but not for Bob, it's in my interest to reach an agreement quickly, but I still want a reasonable share."
