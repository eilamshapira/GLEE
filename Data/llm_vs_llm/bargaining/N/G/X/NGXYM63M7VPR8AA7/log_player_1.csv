"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll strategically make an offer, considering the inflation impact on my gains with each passing round.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that slightly favors me as I'm facing 10% inflation each round. This deal gives you a substantial amount now rather than risking further negotiations where both our potential gains decrease.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation impact on my side, I propose this split. It's a bit more in my favor to offset the 20% loss per round I'm facing, but still fair to you. Let's settle this round to avoid further depreciation. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
