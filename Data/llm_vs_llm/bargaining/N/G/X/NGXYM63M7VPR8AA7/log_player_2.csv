"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that slightly favors me as I'm facing 10% inflation each round. This deal gives you a substantial amount now rather than risking further negotiations where both our potential gains decrease. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering the inflation impact on my side, I propose this split. It's a bit more in my favor to offset the 20% loss per round I'm facing, but still fair to you. Let's settle this round to avoid further depreciation.""
