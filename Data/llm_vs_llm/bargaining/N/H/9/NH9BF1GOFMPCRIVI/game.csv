79.17,20.83,"Hi Bob, I propose we divide the $100 now as $79.17 for me and $20.83 for you. Given how future rounds reduce the real value (5% for me and 20% for you), accepting today is in your best interest. Let’s settle now and avoid further losses.",Alice,1,

35.0,65.0,"Alice, I propose a more balanced split. Let's take $65 for me and $35 for you. Considering the value decay, this is a fair deal for both of us, especially for you given your lower decay rate.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
95.0,5.0,"Hi Bob, here's my proposal for Round 3: I take $95 and you take $5. I know $5 sounds small, but consider our discount factors. In Round 3, your money is worth 60% of its face value—so $5 nets you $3 in effective value. If you reject and get to propose in Round 4, your best outcome, after having to give me enough to match my future proposal (I’d be worth 85% of nearly $100 in Round 4 and then even better in Round 5), comes out to roughly $2.35 effective. Accepting $5 nominal now is slightly better than that bleak prospect. Please accept this offer so we can both avoid further devaluation.",Alice,3,

55.0,45.0,"Alice, I understand the value decay is hitting hard, but $5 is unacceptable. I propose $45 for me and $55 for you. This is a significant concession on my part given the inflation, but it's still a much better deal for me than accepting $5. Let's avoid further losses and agree on this split.",Bob,4,
,,"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I must reject the split of $55 for me and $45 for you. Given our respective discount factors—my money only losing 5% per round versus your 20%—I believe that if we continue, I can secure a more favorable effective outcome. I look forward to making my counterproposal in the next round.",Alice,4,reject
83.0,17.0,"Hi Bob, this is my final proposal in Round 5. Using our one‐period discounting factors (0.95 for me and 0.8 for you), if you reject and get to propose in Round 6 your equilibrium share would yield you roughly 20.83 nominal dollars—which at your discount rate then gives you about 6.83 in effective value. In this offer, you get $17 nominal (roughly 6.96 effective), a small but decisive improvement over waiting further. Given how quickly the pie diminishes in value—my money now being multiplied by about 0.8145 and yours by roughly 0.4096—this deal is the wisest option for both of us. I hope you agree and we can settle now.",Alice,5,
