"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we divide the $100 now as $79.17 for me and $20.83 for you. Given how future rounds reduce the real value (5% for me and 20% for you), accepting today is in your best interest. Let’s settle now and avoid further losses.

# Alice gain: 79.17

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal for Round 3: I take $95 and you take $5. I know $5 sounds small, but consider our discount factors. In Round 3, your money is worth 60% of its face value—so $5 nets you $3 in effective value. If you reject and get to propose in Round 4, your best outcome, after having to give me enough to match my future proposal (I’d be worth 85% of nearly $100 in Round 4 and then even better in Round 5), comes out to roughly $2.35 effective. Accepting $5 nominal now is slightly better than that bleak prospect. Please accept this offer so we can both avoid further devaluation. 
# Bob gain: 5 
# Alice gain: 95

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, this is my final proposal in Round 5. Using our one‐period discounting factors (0.95 for me and 0.8 for you), if you reject and get to propose in Round 6 your equilibrium share would yield you roughly 20.83 nominal dollars—which at your discount rate then gives you about 6.83 in effective value. In this offer, you get $17 nominal (roughly 6.96 effective), a small but decisive improvement over waiting further. Given how quickly the pie diminishes in value—my money now being multiplied by about 0.8145 and yours by roughly 0.4096—this deal is the wisest option for both of us. I hope you agree and we can settle now. 
# Bob gain: 17 
# Alice gain: 83
