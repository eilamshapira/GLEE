Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's stop wasting time. The value is decreasing with each round. A 50/50 split is the fairest and fastest way to settle this. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although I would prefer a slightly larger share, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most strategic decision given the circumstances:

* **Inflation:** The value of Bob's potential gains is decreasing significantly with each round (now down 27.1%). This means he's likely to become more agreeable to a more ""fair"" deal as time passes. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Bob is right, the longer the game goes, the less overall value there is to split. My gains remain unaffected by inflation, but it's still in my best interest to settle quickly.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a better offer in later rounds is risky.  There's no guarantee Bob will offer a deal that's significantly better than 50/50, especially as his perceived value of the money decreases. 

Therefore, while not ideal, accepting the 50/50 split in Round 4 secures a reasonable outcome while minimizing potential losses due to inflation and a protracted negotiation."
