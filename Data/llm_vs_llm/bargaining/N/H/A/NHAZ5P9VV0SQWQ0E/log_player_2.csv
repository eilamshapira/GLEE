"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This is a good deal considering the circumstances. We're losing valuable time! 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is even worse than the first one, considering the inflation is eating into my potential gains.  Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation, but I'm willing to hold out for a better deal."
