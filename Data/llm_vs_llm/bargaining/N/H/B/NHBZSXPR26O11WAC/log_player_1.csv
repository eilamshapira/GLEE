"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Split it evenly, fair for both""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A bit more for me, but you still get a substantial amount. Let's settle this quickly, as your share will decrease with each round due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the fact that my share will decrease with each round, I'll evaluate Bob's offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, the $400,000 Bob offered is actually worth $380,000 to me (400000 * 0.95).

I'll reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my offer needs to take into account the decreasing value of the money for me.

In Round 3, the money I gain is worth 10% less than the original value (5% less in Round 2 and another 5% less in Round 3), so I'll aim to get a bit more to compensate for the loss.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a fair deal for both""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is cutting into your share more and more each round. It's in your best interest to accept this offer before your share shrinks again due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection from Bob.

Now, in Round 4, the money I gain is worth 15% less than the original value (5% less in Round 2, 5% less in Round 3, and approximately 5% less in Round 4, which is 1 - (0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95) = 0.1426 or 14.26% less), so $300,000 is actually worth approximately $257,740 to me (300000 * (1 - 0.1426)).

I'll reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round, but I'm aware that the inflation is working against me.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my offer needs to take into account the significantly decreasing value of the money for me.

In Round 5, the money I gain is worth around 19.08% less than the original value (5% less in Round 2, 5% less in Round 3, 5% less in Round 4, and approximately 5% less in Round 5, which is 1 - (0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95) = 0.1908 or 19.08% less).

To compensate for this loss, I'll aim to get a larger share. However, I also need to be realistic, as Bob has the upper hand due to the inflation.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Last chance for a fair split, considering the inflation""
}
```"
