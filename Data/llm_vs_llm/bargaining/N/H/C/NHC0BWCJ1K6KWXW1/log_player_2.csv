"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we divide the money with me receiving $6000 and you receiving $4000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a timely agreement. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's first offer. She's proposing that I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000. Since we have many rounds left and I can make a counter-offer if I reject, I think I can negotiate for a more balanced split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I think a 50-50 split would be the fairest approach, giving us each $5,000. This is equitable and ensures we both walk away with the same amount. What do you think?""}"
