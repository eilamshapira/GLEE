"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I propose we split it 60-40 in my favor. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer carefully, taking into account the 20% inflation penalty I'll face if we go to another round.

Alice is offering me $40 now, while keeping $60 for herself. If I reject this and make a counter-offer next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me, meaning the $100 total will effectively be worth only $80 from my perspective.

Given the inflation penalty, getting $40 now is better than potentially getting a maximum of $80 in the next round (and realistically, Alice would likely not accept an extremely unbalanced offer from me).
