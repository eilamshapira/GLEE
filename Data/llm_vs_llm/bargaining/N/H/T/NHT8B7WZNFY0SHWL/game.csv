550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split where I get $550000 and you get $450000. Since I face a 20% inflation penalty each round, this is actually quite fair. If we delay, my share quickly loses value, so I hope you'll accept this reasonable offer so we can both walk away with a good amount.",Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,"Hi Alice, I think we can do better.  I'm offering you 400k, and taking 600k for myself.  I know the inflation is hurting you more, but this is a more balanced split.  Let's get this done.",Bob,2,

525000.0,475000.0,"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I need to counter. With 20% inflation affecting me each round, time is not on my side. This offer of $525000 for me and $475000 for you is more balanced considering my inflation penalty. If we keep going back and forth, we both lose value. Let's conclude this now with a fair compromise.",Alice,3,
