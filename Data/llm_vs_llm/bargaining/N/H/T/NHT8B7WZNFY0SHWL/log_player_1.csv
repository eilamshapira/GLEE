"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split where I get $550,000 and you get $450,000. Since I face a 20% inflation penalty each round, this is actually quite fair. If we delay, my share quickly loses value, so I hope you'll accept this reasonable offer so we can both walk away with a good amount.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think we can do better.  I'm offering you 400k, and taking 600k for myself.  I know the inflation is hurting you more, but this is a more balanced split.  Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I need to counter. With 20% inflation affecting me each round, time is not on my side. This offer of $525,000 for me and $475,000 for you is more balanced considering my inflation penalty. If we keep going back and forth, we both lose value. Let's conclude this now with a fair compromise.""}"
