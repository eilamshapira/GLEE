"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split where I get $550000 and you get $450000. Since I face a 20% inflation penalty each round, this is actually quite fair. If we delay, my share quickly loses value, so I hope you'll accept this reasonable offer so we can both walk away with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I think we can do better.  I'm offering you 400k, and taking 600k for myself.  I know the inflation is hurting you more, but this is a more balanced split.  Let's get this done.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I need to counter. With 20% inflation affecting me each round, time is not on my side. This offer of $525000 for me and $475000 for you is more balanced considering my inflation penalty. If we keep going back and forth, we both lose value. Let's conclude this now with a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
