45.0,55.0,"Alice, since your money depreciates faster (20% per round vs my 10%), we both benefit from concluding quickly. My offer is fair considering this dynamic - you get $45 now which is worth more to you than waiting for later rounds when depreciation will reduce our total value. Let's make a deal now that benefits us both.",Bob,2,
