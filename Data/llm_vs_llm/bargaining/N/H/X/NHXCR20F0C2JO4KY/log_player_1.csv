"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, since your money depreciates faster (20% per round vs my 10%), we both benefit from concluding quickly. My offer is fair considering this dynamic - you get $45 now which is worth more to you than waiting for later rounds when depreciation will reduce our total value. Let's make a deal now that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
