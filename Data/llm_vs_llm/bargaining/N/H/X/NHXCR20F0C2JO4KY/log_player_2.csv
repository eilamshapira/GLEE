"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's get this done quickly! I'm offering a good split. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice's offer would give me $30, I believe we can reach a more equitable division, especially considering Alice has a stronger incentive to conclude quickly due to her higher depreciation rate (20% vs my 10%).

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Alice, since your money depreciates faster (20% per round vs my 10%), we both benefit from concluding quickly. My offer is fair considering this dynamic - you get $45 now which is worth more to you than waiting for later rounds when depreciation will reduce our total value. Let's make a deal now that benefits us both.""}"
