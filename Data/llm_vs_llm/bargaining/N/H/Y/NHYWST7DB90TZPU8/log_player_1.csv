"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor as I'm making the first move and taking initiative.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm happy to split the money a bit more evenly. Let's go with 55/45, in my favor this time. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept now, I get $45, but it's worth 10% less due to inflation, so effectively $40.50
2. If I reject, we go to another round where I can make an offer, but everything will be worth 20% less than the original value
3. Even if I make a better split in my favor next round, the value loss might not be worth it
