Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

I'm rejecting this offer. While the value of the money is decreasing, getting only $40 after rejecting a 50/50 split is not a good strategy. I need to incentivize Alice to accept a deal that gives me a larger share."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The value of the money is decreasing significantly with each round, and Alice seems unlikely to budge much further. Accepting a 30/70 split is better than risking an even worse outcome in further rounds."
