I'm proposing a 90/10 split, with me receiving $900,000 and Bob receiving $100,000. I want to secure a large portion of the money in the first round, before inflation drastically reduces its value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
