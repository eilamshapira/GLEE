"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $100,000 while she gets $900,000, which is only 10% of the total for me. Since I know there's 20% inflation per round for me, waiting has a significant cost. However, this first offer seems quite unbalanced in Alice's favor.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer, considering the inflation effect on my side while still being fair.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split which I believe is fair to both of us. Let's divide the million dollars equally and both walk away with a substantial amount rather than risk further devaluation through additional rounds."
