"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's split it 60/40. This is a generous offer to start with and avoids the risk of further inflation affecting us both. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer gives me $40
2. If I reject and propose next round:
   * The money will be worth 10% less to me
   * Maximum I could get in next round would be $90, but worth $81 due to inflation
   * Alice might reject my offer anyway, leading to further rounds and more inflation

The $40 offer is a reasonable starting point. While I could try for more, the risk of inflation and potential further rejections makes this a decent offer. The loss from inflation in future rounds could easily make me end up with less.
