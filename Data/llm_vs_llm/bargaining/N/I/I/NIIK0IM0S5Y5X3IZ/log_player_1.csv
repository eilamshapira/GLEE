"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a division that accounts for the fact that delay costs me more due to the 10% inflation penalty. I'll aim for a fair but advantageous split.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this split because it's a reasonable division that gives me a slightly larger share while still being attractive enough for Bob to accept rather than risk moving to the next round, where the total value would be worth less to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept Bob's 50-50 split now, I'll get $5000, but due to 10% inflation, it's only worth $4500 to me
- If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount I receive will be worth 20% less
- There's no guarantee Bob would accept my next offer, leading to further rounds and more value loss for me

Given that any further delay will cost me more due to inflation, and this is a reasonable offer (even with the 10% reduction, I'm still getting a significant amount), I should accept.
