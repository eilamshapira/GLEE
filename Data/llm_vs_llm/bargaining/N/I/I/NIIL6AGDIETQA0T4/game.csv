5500.0,4500.0,"I'm proposing a fair 55/45 split considering we both need to agree. If we delay, the value decreases for me by 5% each round, which isn't in either of our interests.",Alice,1,

100.0,9900.0,"Alice, delaying further costs you 5% per round. In your next turn you might think you can gain more, but given the discount you’d face and my unyielding position, you'll end up with very little. Accept this offer now to secure $100 in full present value before additional devaluation occurs.",Bob,2,

4500.0,5500.0,"Bob, your last offer was extremely unfair. Let's be reasonable - I'm now offering you the majority (55%) in recognition of my weakening position due to inflation. This is a fair compromise that benefits us both rather than continuing this game where we might both end up with nothing if we can't agree by round 12.",Alice,3,

4800.0,5200.0,"Alice, delaying further will only hurt you more because each round further erodes your share’s value. Accepting now gives you an effective value that is marginally better than what you might expect by waiting another round. I’m offering you $4800 while I secure $5200, a split that reflects the cost of delay on your side. Let’s close this deal before the inflation penalty deepens your loss.",Bob,4,
