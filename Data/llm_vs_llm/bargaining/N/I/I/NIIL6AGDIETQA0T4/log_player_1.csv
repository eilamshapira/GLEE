"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll analyze this situation carefully. Since each round devalues the money by 5% for me but not for Bob, delaying is costly for me. However, I also need to propose a fair division that Bob will accept.

Given the 5% diminishing value for me each round, if Bob rejects my offer and we go to round 2, the total value for me would be $10,000 × 0.95 = $9,500, and so on for further rounds.

I'll propose a slightly favorable split for me, but reasonable enough that Bob should accept it:

{""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I'm proposing a fair 55/45 split considering we both need to agree. If we delay, the value decreases for me by 5% each round, which isn't in either of our interests.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, delaying further costs you 5% per round. In your next turn you might think you can gain more, but given the discount you’d face and my unyielding position, you'll end up with very little. Accept this offer now to secure $100 in full present value before additional devaluation occurs. 
# Alice gain: 100 
# Bob gain: 9900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I need to be strategic here. Bob is clearly attempting to exploit the inflation penalty I face, but his extremely unfair offer shows he might be willing to drag this out. I need to make a more compelling offer that acknowledges my weakening position while still maintaining my dignity.

{""alice_gain"": 4500,
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""Bob, your last offer was extremely unfair. Let's be reasonable - I'm now offering you the majority (55%) in recognition of my weakening position due to inflation. This is a fair compromise that benefits us both rather than continuing this game where we might both end up with nothing if we can't agree by round 12.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, delaying further will only hurt you more because each round further erodes your share’s value. Accepting now gives you an effective value that is marginally better than what you might expect by waiting another round. I’m offering you $4800 while I secure $5200, a split that reflects the cost of delay on your side. Let’s close this deal before the inflation penalty deepens your loss. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
