"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm proposing a fair 55/45 split considering we both need to agree. If we delay, the value decreases for me by 5% each round, which isn't in either of our interests. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 9900, ""alice_gain"": 100, ""message"": ""Alice, delaying further costs you 5% per round. In your next turn you might think you can gain more, but given the discount you’d face and my unyielding position, you'll end up with very little. Accept this offer now to secure $100 in full present value before additional devaluation occurs.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your last offer was extremely unfair. Let's be reasonable - I'm now offering you the majority (55%) in recognition of my weakening position due to inflation. This is a fair compromise that benefits us both rather than continuing this game where we might both end up with nothing if we can't agree by round 12. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Alice, delaying further will only hurt you more because each round further erodes your share’s value. Accepting now gives you an effective value that is marginally better than what you might expect by waiting another round. I’m offering you $4800 while I secure $5200, a split that reflects the cost of delay on your side. Let’s close this deal before the inflation penalty deepens your loss.""}"
