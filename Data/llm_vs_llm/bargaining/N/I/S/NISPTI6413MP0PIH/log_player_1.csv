"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","For my first offer, I'll propose a fair division that takes into account the inflation effect.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000. I'm offering a bit more to myself because I know I face 20% inflation with each round, so delaying reduces the value of my share significantly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a counter-offer that accounts for our different inflation rates, which I now know."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Now that I understand that Bob faces 10% inflation per round while I face 20% inflation per round, I'll make a more strategic offer.

{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000}

I'm offering Bob a bit more than before since I now know we both face inflation, though mine is higher. This should be more appealing to him than my first offer, while still giving me a fair share considering I face higher inflation pressure."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
