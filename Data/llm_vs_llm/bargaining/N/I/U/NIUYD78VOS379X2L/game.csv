6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering we both lose value in later rounds, and you lose less than I do per round (10% vs 20%). Let's make a deal now and both walk away with good value.",Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe a 55-45 split in my favor is more equitable given the inflation rates. You lose value faster, but starting with a bit more for me balances it out over time. Let's agree on this and secure a good deal for both of us before the value drops further.",Bob,2,
