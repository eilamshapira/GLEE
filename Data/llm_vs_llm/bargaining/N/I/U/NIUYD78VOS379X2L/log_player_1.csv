"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe a 55-45 split in my favor is more equitable given the inflation rates. You lose value faster, but starting with a bit more for me balances it out over time. Let's agree on this and secure a good deal for both of us before the value drops further. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While it's not ideal compared to my initial proposal, it's still a reasonable split considering the inflation rates. With my 20% inflation rate per round, delaying further would significantly reduce the real value I receive. Getting $4,500 now is better than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds."
