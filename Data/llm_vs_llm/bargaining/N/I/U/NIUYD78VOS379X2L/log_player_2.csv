"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering we both lose value in later rounds, and you lose less than I do per round (10% vs 20%). Let's make a deal now and both walk away with good value. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe a 55-45 split in my favor is more equitable given the inflation rates. You lose value faster, but starting with a bit more for me balances it out over time. Let's agree on this and secure a good deal for both of us before the value drops further.""
