"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer that considers both our interests, keeping in mind the different inflation rates affecting us.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose I receive $5,500 and you receive $4,500. Since inflation affects me more heavily (20% per round vs your 5%), it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. This offer gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging my disadvantage in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4600 
# Bob gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","After considering our positions and the increasing impact of inflation, I'll make a revised offer.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, 
""bob_gain"": 4800}

I'm proposing I receive $5,200 and you receive $4,800. This is a more favorable split for you than my initial offer, showing my willingness to compromise. Given that inflation is affecting me at 20% per round compared to your 5%, reaching an agreement now is significantly better for both of us than continuing to future rounds where the total value diminishes."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4300 
# Bob gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
