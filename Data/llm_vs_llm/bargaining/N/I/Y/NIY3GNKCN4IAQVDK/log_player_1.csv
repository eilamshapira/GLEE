"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I should make a fair but strategic first offer, considering that:
1. Each round devalues the money more for me (20%) than for Bob (10%)
2. Bob can counter-offer if he declines
3. A fair split gives us a better chance of quick agreement

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose this split because while it gives me a slight advantage, it's not so unfair that Bob would definitely reject it. If he does reject, the total value will decrease more for me than for him in the next round, so I want to make a reasonable first offer."
