"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. I would get $45, Alice would get $55
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. However, due to inflation:
   - For me, money will be worth 10% less next round
   - For Alice, money will be worth 20% less next round
4. This means if I reject, my $45 would effectively become worth $40.50 next round
5. This is a fairly reasonable first offer, as I get 45% of the total

Given that inflation will reduce my purchasing power in the next round, and this is a decent offer, I'll accept.
