"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my offer: I get $70 and you get $30. I believe that acting now helps both of us avoid any potential inflationary loss—especially since delaying might reduce the effective value for you if inflation hits harder on your side. Let’s settle this quickly for our mutual benefit. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 40, ""alice_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I know we both want to avoid further losses. Considering that waiting will cut my share by 10% each round, I'm offering a more balanced split—$40 for me and $60 for you. Let's settle now and both benefit by avoiding further devaluation. What do you say?""}"
