"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a reasonable but slightly advantageous offer for myself, considering this is just the first round and we have room for negotiation.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this 60-40 split because I believe it's fair enough to have a good chance of being accepted while still giving me a slight advantage. It's not too greedy, and it leaves Bob with a substantial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. Bob is offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance. However, due to inflation, Bob's $5000 is actually worth 5% less to him (effectively $4750 in round 1 value), while my $5000 maintains its full value.

This offer is actually better for me than my initial proposal. In my first offer, I would have gotten $6000 and Bob $4000. Now I'm being offered $5000 while Bob gets an inflation-adjusted $4750 (in round 1 value). 

Since this is a good deal for me, and we don't know if future rounds might lead to worse outcomes:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
