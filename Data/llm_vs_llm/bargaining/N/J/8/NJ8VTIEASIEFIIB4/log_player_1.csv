"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a division that accounts for the different inflation rates affecting Bob and me. Since Bob's money devalues faster (20% per round) compared to mine (5% per round), he has more incentive to accept a reasonable offer early.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this 60-40 split because it's fair enough to make Bob seriously consider accepting it, while still giving me a good portion. If Bob rejects this, he'll face a 20% devaluation in the next round, meaning even a higher offer then might be worth less to him than this offer now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 510000 
# Bob gain: 490000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Due to 5% inflation for me, $510,000 is now worth: $510,000 * 0.95 = $484,500
2. Due to 20% inflation for Bob, $490,000 is now worth: $490,000 * 0.80 = $392,000 to him

This is actually a decent offer considering the inflation effects. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round:
- Money will be worth 10% less for me
- Money will be worth 40% less for Bob

Given that Bob's money is devaluing much faster than mine, and this current offer gives me a reasonable amount ($484,500 in real value), I'll accept this offer.
