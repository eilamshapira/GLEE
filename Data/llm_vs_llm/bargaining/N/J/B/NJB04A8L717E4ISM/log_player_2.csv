"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because:
1. It gives me a majority share to compensate for the 10% inflation penalty I face each round
2. It's still fair enough that Alice might accept rather than risk getting less in future rounds
3. At 55-45 split, it's not so greedy that Alice would definitely reject"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The reasoning:
1. With 19% inflation, my $400,000 would be worth $324,000 in round 1 terms
2. If I reject, in the next round I'd face 27.1% inflation (0.9 ^ 3)
3. Even if I proposed a better split next round, Alice might reject again, leading to even more inflation
4. $400,000 with 19% inflation is better than risking further rounds with increasing inflation
5. This is a significant improvement from Alice's initial offer of $100,000"
