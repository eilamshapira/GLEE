"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer that's beneficial for both of us, keeping in mind the 10% inflation per round that affects me.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose I get $600,000 and you get $400,000. This is a fair split that favors me slightly since I'm making the first offer, but still gives you a substantial portion of the money. Since we both face inflation risks with each passing round, it makes sense to reach an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
