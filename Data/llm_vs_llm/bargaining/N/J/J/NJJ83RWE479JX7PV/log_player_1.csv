I'm aiming to get at least $60. I'm willing to negotiate down a little, but not that low yet.  Let's see what Bob proposes in the next round."

I'm lowering my ask slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a larger share."

This is getting close, but still not good enough.  The inflation is starting to hurt, but I think I can get Bob to come up a little bit more."

This is getting very close to the wire, but I'm going to hold out one more round. Bob is moving closer to my position, and the risk of getting nothing is significant if I don't get him to agree soon."

Time to cut my losses.  The inflation means waiting any longer will cost me more than I gain by holding out."
