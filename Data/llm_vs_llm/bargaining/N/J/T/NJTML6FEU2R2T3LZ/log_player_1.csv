"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair but slightly favorable split for myself, considering potential future inflation if negotiations continue.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose splitting the money $55 for me and $45 for Bob - a reasonable division that gives both of us a substantial portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Due to 10% inflation for me, $48 is now worth $43.2 in round 1 terms
2. This is significantly less than the $55 I proposed
3. However, if I reject and we go to round 3, any amount I get will be worth 20% less
4. So even if I manage to get a better nominal split in round 3, the real value might be lower
5. The risk of further devaluation is significant
