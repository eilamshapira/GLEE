"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has proposed an even split of $5,000 each. This is a fair initial offer, but I need to consider the inflation factor. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total money will be worth 5% less to me. That means the $10,000 would effectively be worth $9,500 to me in the next round.

If I accept now, I get $5,000. If I reject, even if I could somehow get the entire $10,000 in the next round (which is unlikely since Alice would need to accept), that would only be worth $9,500 to me because of inflation. So my maximum potential gain by rejecting is less than double what I'm offered now.

Given the fair nature of the initial offer and the penalty of inflation, I should accept.
