"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I need to consider that when evaluating the offer. 

To calculate the value of the offer, I'll multiply the amount by 0.95 (1 - 0.05 inflation).

The value of Bob's offer to me is: 40 * 0.95 = 38

Considering this, I think I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less with each round, and this is the third round, I'll calculate the value as follows:

Round 1: 100%
Round 2: 95% (1 - 0.05)
Round 3: 95% * 0.95 = 90.25% (or 1 - 0.05, then multiply by 0.95 again)

To maximize my gain, I'll offer Bob a smaller amount.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","To calculate the value of the offer, I'll multiply the amount by the factor representing the decrease in value due to inflation.

The decrease in value for me is 14.26%, so the value of the offer is:
42 * (1 - 0.1426) = 42 * 0.8574 = 36

Considering this, I think I should accept the offer, as the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I don't know how Bob's perception of the value is changing.
