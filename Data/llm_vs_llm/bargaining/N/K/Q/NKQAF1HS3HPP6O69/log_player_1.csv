"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. Here's my offer for Round 1, formatted as a JSON:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

My reasoning is that offering slightly more than half to myself increases the likelihood of Bob accepting, especially considering the looming (though unknown to him) inflation affecting *my* gains. I am prioritizing a quick resolution before the money effectively devalues for me."
