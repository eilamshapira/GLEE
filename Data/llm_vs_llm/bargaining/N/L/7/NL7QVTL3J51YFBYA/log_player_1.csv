"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is a fairer starting point, considering we both want to minimize losses due to inflation. Let's see if we can come to a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Reasoning (not part of response): Given the 10% inflation penalty, if I reject and propose in the next round, my share would be worth 10% less. Even if I could secure a higher nominal amount in the next round, the inflation would eat into those gains. Bob's current offer of 4500 is worth more to me than a higher nominal amount in the next round that would be reduced by inflation. The 45-55 split is reasonable enough to accept rather than risk further value erosion."
