"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me propose a fair split that accounts for the inflation risk I face.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this 60-40 split in my favor because I face a 20% inflation penalty if we move to the next round. A slightly larger share for me helps offset this risk while still giving Bob a substantial portion. The split is reasonable enough that Bob should seriously consider accepting rather than moving to the next round."
