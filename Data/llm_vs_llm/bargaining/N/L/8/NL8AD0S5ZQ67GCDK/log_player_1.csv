"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Based on a standard alternating‐offers analysis (à la Rubinstein) where each round’s delay cuts each player’s “real” money by their personal discount rate—0.95 per round for you (Alice) and 0.90 per round for Bob—the unique subgame‐perfect equilibrium when you propose first gives you a larger share. (In the classical solution with discount factors δ₍A₎ = 0.95 and δ₍B₎ = 0.90, the equilibrium division of a “pie” normalized to 1 is:

  Alice’s share = (1 – δ₍B₎)/(1 – δ₍A₎×δ₍B₎) ≈ (1 – 0.90)/(1 – 0.95×0.90) ≈ 0.10/0.145 ≈ 0.6897  
  Bob’s share = 1 – 0.6897 ≈ 0.3103)

Translating that into our $10,000 division leads to an initial proposal of roughly $6,897 for you and $3,103 for Bob.

Thus, in Round 1 my offer (as Alice) is:

{""alice_gain"": 6897, ""bob_gain"": 3103}

This offer gives Bob about what he would expect to obtain if he were to wait (after his own 10% discount each round) while letting me take advantage of my slightly better patience (5% per round)."
