"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, the actual value I get from Bob's offer is 400000 * 0.9 = 360000.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is not favorable to me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less in each round, and this is the third round, the actual value I get will be 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 of the nominal value.

To make it more favorable for myself, I'll make an offer that gives me a bit more.
