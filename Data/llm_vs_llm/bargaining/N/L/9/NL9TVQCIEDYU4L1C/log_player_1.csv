"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer that takes into account our different inflation rates while being fair.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm proposing we split the money with me taking $5,500 and you getting $4,500. Since my inflation rate is higher (10% vs your 5%), I'm suggesting a slightly higher share for myself to compensate for the greater loss I'll face if we delay. This is a fair division that gives us both a substantial amount while acknowledging our different situations."
