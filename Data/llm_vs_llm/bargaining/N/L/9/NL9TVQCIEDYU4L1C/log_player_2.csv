"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze this offer. I, as Bob, am being offered $4500. Since this is round 1, the money hasn't been affected by inflation yet. If I reject, the money available shrinks by 5% for me and 10% for Alice *every* round, in addition to the risk of not reaching an agreement within 12 rounds, resulting in both of us getting nothing. It's also important to consider that I might get offered even less in future rounds, especially with Alice now knowing my risk aversion.

$4500 seems like a decent starting offer, and the risk of losing out on potentially more later is higher than the probability of getting more in my opinion.
