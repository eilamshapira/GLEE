"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the money equally: $50 for each. Accepting this offer now avoids future inflation risk (at least on my side). I believe this fair split benefits us both. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the offer is to split the money equally, which is a fair proposal, and considering that accepting this offer now avoids future inflation risk, I will accept the offer.
