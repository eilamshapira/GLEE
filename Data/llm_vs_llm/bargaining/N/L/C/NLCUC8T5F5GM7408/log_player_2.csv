"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider the offer carefully. Alice is offering me $45 while taking $55. With the 20% inflation per round, if I reject and make a counter-offer, the total value decreases for me. If I reject now, I'd propose in round 2 where the money is worth 20% less to me.

Given the inflation effect and the fact that $45 is reasonably close to a 50-50 split, I'll accept this offer rather than risk further devaluation.
