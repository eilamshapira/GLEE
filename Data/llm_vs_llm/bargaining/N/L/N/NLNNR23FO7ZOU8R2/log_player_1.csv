"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose an equal 50-50 split. This is fair for both of us, and you should consider that the money will be worth less to you in future rounds due to your 5% inflation rate. An equal split now is better than negotiating further. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
