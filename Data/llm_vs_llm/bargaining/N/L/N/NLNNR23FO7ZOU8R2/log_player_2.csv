"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly. This is a good start. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice's offer gives her a slightly larger share, I need to consider the diminishing value for her in future rounds. If I reject, the next round's money would be worth 5% less to her but the same to me. I can potentially negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that accounts for the declining value Alice faces while still being fair.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""I propose an equal 50-50 split. This is fair for both of us, and you should consider that the money will be worth less to you in future rounds due to your 5% inflation rate. An equal split now is better than negotiating further.""}"
