"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split while considering that Bob's money loses 10% value each round. Since I'm making the first offer, I'll propose a balanced split.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose we split the money equally - 50$ each. This is a fair offer that respects both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. 
- Bob's 60$ is actually worth 54$ to him due to 10% inflation
- My 40$ would be worth full 40$ to me
- If I reject, we move to round 3 where I can make an offer, but Bob's money will be worth even less (20% less than original)
- This gives me negotiating power in the next round
- 40$ is less than my fair 50-50 opening offer

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's money is now worth 20% less to him, I can leverage this. His $100 is only worth $80 to him now. I'll propose a split that accounts for this depreciation while still being reasonably attractive to him.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose I get $60 and Bob gets $40. Due to the 20% inflation on Bob's side, his $40 is actually worth $32 to him now. If he rejects and we continue to later rounds, his money will be worth even less, so this is a reasonable offer considering the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- Bob's $65 is actually worth only about $47.40 to him (due to 27.1% inflation)
- My $35 would be worth full $35 to me
- If I reject, we move to round 5 where I can make an offer, and Bob's money will be worth about 34% less than original
- We still have 8 rounds left, and Bob's money keeps losing value
- $35 is significantly less than my previous offers and less than a fair split considering the inflation effect

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's money is now worth about 34% less to him, I'll make an offer that considers this significant depreciation. Strategic negotiations suggest I should take advantage of this weakening position while still making it worthwhile for Bob to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I propose I get $70 and Bob gets $30. Due to the 34% inflation on Bob's side, his $30 is actually worth about $20 to him now. If he continues to reject, his money will be worth even less in future rounds. This offer actually gives us both meaningful value considering the circumstances, and he should consider accepting before his position weakens further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- Bob's $70 is only worth about $41.33 to him (due to 40.95% inflation)
- My $30 would be worth full $30 to me
- If I reject, we move to round 7 where I can make an offer, and Bob's money will be worth about 47% less than original
- We still have 6 rounds left, and Bob's money keeps losing substantial value
- $30 is even less than his previous offer of $35, while his money is worth less now
- His negotiating position is getting weaker, not stronger

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","With Bob's money now worth about 47% less, his negotiating position has weakened considerably. Making any reasonable amount worthwhile for him is becoming harder, but I need to make an offer that he might accept to avoid risking both of us getting nothing.

{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}

I propose I get $75 and Bob gets $25. Due to the 47% inflation on Bob's side, his $25 is actually worth only about $13.25 to him now. If he rejects again, his future gains will be worth even less. We're over halfway through our rounds, so he should seriously consider accepting this offer before his position deteriorates further. The alternative of continuing to negotiate will only reduce the real value he can get."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- Bob's $75 is only worth about $35.87 to him (due to 52.17% inflation)
- My $25 would be worth full $25 to me
- If I reject, we move to round 9 where I can make an offer, and Bob's money will be worth about 57% less
- We have 4 rounds left, and Bob's money continues to rapidly lose value
- $25 is even less than his previous offer of $30
- His position is extremely weak, yet he's offering me less than before
- The time pressure is building, but I still have leverage

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","With Bob's money now worth about 57% less and only 3 rounds remaining after this one, I need to make a strong offer that considers both the severe depreciation and the increasing time pressure.

{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}

I propose I get $85 and Bob gets $15. Due to the 57% inflation on Bob's side, his $15 is worth only about $6.45 to him now. While this might seem aggressive, the alternative for Bob is worse - if he rejects, his money will be worth even less in the remaining rounds, and we risk both getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement in the final rounds. This offer still gives him some value, and with the time pressure mounting, he should seriously consider accepting rather than risking further depreciation or complete loss."
