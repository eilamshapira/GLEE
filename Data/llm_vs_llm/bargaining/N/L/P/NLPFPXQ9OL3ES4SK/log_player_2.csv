"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Let's see if Alice can do better than a 50/50 split. With inflation affecting my share each round, I should aim for more than 50 to make up for the loss in value over time."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

Let's see if Alice accepts this offer. This offer gives me a larger share to compensate for the inflation affecting my share each round. If Alice accepts, I will have made up for the loss in value from the first round. If she rejects, we will continue to the next round, and I will have to adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is even less advantageous for me than her first offer, and with inflation, the value of my share is decreasing each round. I will reject this offer and hope for a better one in the next round. Let's see if Alice is willing to give me a more favorable split as the game progresses."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35}

I'll try for a slightly larger share this time to compensate for the inflation affecting my gains. If Alice accepts, I'll have made up for some of the lost value from previous rounds. If she rejects, we'll continue to the next round, and I'll need to reevaluate my strategy."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is even worse for me than her previous ones. With inflation, the value of my share is decreasing significantly each round. I will reject this offer and hope that Alice becomes more cooperative in the following rounds, as we approach the end of the game."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30}

Given the inflation, I need to secure a larger share to make up for the lost value. Let's see if Alice will accept this offer or if we will continue negotiating in the next rounds. We're halfway through the game, so it's essential to start considering the decreasing value of my share more seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer keeps getting worse for me. With inflation significantly affecting my share, I can't afford to accept such a low offer. I'll reject it and hope that Alice starts being more reasonable in the upcoming rounds, as we're running out of time to reach an agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 75, ""alice_gain"": 25}

With inflation taking a significant toll on my share, I need to secure a more substantial part of the money to make up for the lost value. Let's see if Alice accepts this offer or if we will continue negotiating in the following rounds. We only have a few rounds left, so it's crucial to make the most of my share."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 15 
# Alice gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Given the high inflation affecting my share, it's better to secure some money now rather than risking getting nothing in the following rounds. Even though Alice's offer is not favorable, the decreasing value of my share makes it more reasonable to accept this offer."
