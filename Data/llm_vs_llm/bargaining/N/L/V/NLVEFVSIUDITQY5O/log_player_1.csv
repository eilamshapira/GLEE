"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split that accounts for the 20% inflation penalty I'll face if this goes to another round.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split where I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. This is slightly in my favor but still reasonably fair, and accepting it now would avoid inflation losses for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Due to 20% inflation, if I accept $4,000 now, it's effectively worth only $3,200 to me (4000 * 0.8)
2. If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount I get will be worth another 20% less
3. Bob's first rejection suggests they're playing aggressively
4. If I reject, I risk getting an even worse deal in the next round due to compounding inflation

Even though this offer seems unfair, the inflation penalty makes rejecting risky. The effective $3,200 value I'd get now might be better than what I could secure in future rounds with increasing inflation penalties.
