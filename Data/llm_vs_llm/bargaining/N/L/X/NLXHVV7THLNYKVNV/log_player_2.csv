"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is suggesting I receive $400,000 while she gets $600,000 of the $1,000,000 total. This is a 40/60 split.

While I'd prefer a more equal split, I should consider a few factors:
1. We have a total of 12 rounds, so I have opportunities to counter
2. The money doesn't lose value for me over time (0% inflation for me)
3. I don't know if Alice faces inflation pressure

Since I don't lose value by waiting and can make a counter-offer in the next round, I'll reject this initial offer to try for a better split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split that's still favorable to Alice but closer to equal.

{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000}

I'm suggesting a 48/52 split which is more equitable than the previous 40/60 offer while still giving Alice a slight advantage. This represents a fair compromise that acknowledges her initial position but moves toward a more balanced division."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Alice has improved her offer from 400k/600k to 450k/550k. I also notice that she's now facing inflation - her money is worth 9.75% less than in the first round, while my money retains full value.

This is an interesting development. Alice has moved toward a more equal split, likely recognizing the inflation pressure she faces. However, I still have plenty of rounds remaining and face no inflation penalty myself.

Since I'm in a stronger position (no inflation) and we still have 9 rounds left, I'll counter with another offer to try to reach a more favorable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that Alice is facing inflation while I'm not, I'll propose a more equitable split that still accounts for our relative bargaining positions.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a completely equal 50/50 split of the money. This is fair and acknowledges that we both deserve an equal share. Since Alice faces increasing inflation pressure with each round while I don't, this even split represents a reasonable compromise that should be attractive to both of us."
