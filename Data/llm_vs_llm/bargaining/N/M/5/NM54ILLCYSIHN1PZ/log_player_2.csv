"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice is offering me $100,000 out of $1,000,000
2. That's only 10% of the total amount
3. If I reject, the money will be worth 10% less to me next round
4. However, I can make a counter-offer that's more favorable
5. Even with the 10% penalty, I could propose a much better split in the next round

This offer is too low. Even with the inflation penalty, I can do better by making a counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer. Since I'm facing 10% inflation per round and Alice isn't, I should propose a reasonable split that Alice might accept to avoid multiple rounds of negotiation.

{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000}

This offer gives me 45% and Alice 55% of the total amount. It's much fairer than the initial 10-90 split she proposed, while still giving her a slight advantage to make it more appealing. If she rejects this, she risks me making a less favorable offer in future rounds if this continues."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Alice has increased her offer from $100K to $150K
2. However, due to 19% inflation, $150K is worth only about $121.5K to me now
3. This is still a very low offer (15% of the total)
4. We have 9 rounds left
5. Even with increasing inflation, I can still make better counter-offers
6. The next round will have 27.1% inflation for me, but I can propose a much better split

This offer is still too low to accept.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice has rejected my previous 45-55 split and only made low offers, I need to consider the inflation impact while still trying to reach a reasonable agreement.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is completely fair. My reasoning is:
1. With 27.1% inflation for me, delays are getting costly
2. A 50-50 split is objectively fair and hard to argue against
3. If Alice rejects this, she's clearly not negotiating in good faith
4. Better to propose an even split now than risk further rounds where my share becomes worth less due to inflation"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:
1. Alice has increased her offer to $200K
2. With 34.39% inflation, $200K is actually worth about $131.2K to me
3. This is still only 20% of the total pot
4. We're in round 5 of 12, so we still have 7 rounds left
5. Alice seems to be making small increases each time, hoping the inflation pressure will force me to accept
6. The next round will have 41.85% inflation for me, which is getting significant

However, even with the increasing inflation, this offer is still too low. I believe I can still negotiate better terms.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that Alice has rejected both my 45-55 and 50-50 splits, and the inflation is getting serious (41.85% for me now), I need to adjust my strategy. I'll try a split that gives Alice a bit more while still ensuring I get a reasonable amount.

{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000}

My reasoning:
1. This 40-60 split gives Alice a clear majority (60%)
2. It's still much better than her offers of 80-20
3. With inflation at 41.85%, further delays are very costly for me
4. This offer demonstrates willingness to compromise while maintaining a reasonable position
5. For Alice, there's little rational reason to reject this as it's a very good deal for her"
