"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money equally so we both walk away happy. Fair deal, right? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider my options here. Alice's offer is a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance. However, I should remember that with each passing round, the money is worth 20% less to me due to inflation. If I reject and propose in the next round, the total value to me would be reduced.

Let me calculate: If I reject, in the next round the $100 would be worth only $80 to me due to 20% inflation. Even if I got all $80, that's less than the $50 Alice is offering me now.

Given the inflation penalty and the fairness of a 50-50 split, this is actually a good offer.
