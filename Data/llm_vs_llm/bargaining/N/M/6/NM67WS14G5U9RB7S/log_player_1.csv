# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer seems reasonable, and considering the inflation that's affecting his gain, I think this is a good opportunity to accept. The fact that he's willing to give me 60% of the original amount, while his own gain is worth 27.1% less, makes this offer more attractive.
