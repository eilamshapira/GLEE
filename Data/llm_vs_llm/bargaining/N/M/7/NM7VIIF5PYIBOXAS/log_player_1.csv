"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I must analyze the offer, taking inflation into account.

*   **My Gain (Alice):** $500,000, but it's worth 5% less than in Round 1. Effectively, it's worth $500,000 * (1 - 0.05) = $475,000 in Round 1 terms.
*   **Bob's Gain:** $500,000, which is the same value as in Round 1.

In Round 1 terms, Bob is getting $500,000 and I am getting $475,000, a worse deal than my initial offer, so I must reject this.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 3, taking into account that my money is now worth 5% less than it was in Round 2, which means it's worth 10% less than Round 1.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
