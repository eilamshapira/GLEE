"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the actual value I'm considering is $1,000,000 * 0.8 = $800,000. 

To make a fair offer, I'll split this value roughly in half.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value for me is $1,000,000 * 0.64 = $640,000, and for Alice, it's $1,000,000 * 0.81 = $810,000.

Alice's offer gives me $100,000, which is roughly 15.6% of the total value from my perspective ($100,000 / $640,000).

I think I can do better than that.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Due to inflation, the money I gain is now worth 20% * 3 = 44.8% less than in the first round (since it's 20% less each round, and this is the 4th round: 1 - 0.8 = 0.2, 0.8 - 0.8*0.8 = 0.128, 0.8*0.8 - 0.8*0.8*0.8 = 0.0512, adding these up gives the total percentage lost), so the actual value I'm considering is $1,000,000 * 0.5512 = $551,200, but more accurately $1,000,000 * (0.8^3) = $512,000.

For Alice, the money is worth 19% * 3 = 51.3% less is incorrect since it is only reduced by 19% of the original once (in round 3), and then 19% of the remaining in round 4 would be (0.81 * 0.81), so the actual value for Alice is $1,000,000 * (0.81^2) = $656,100, but more accurately $1,000,000 * 0.6561.

To make a fair offer, I'll aim to split the value considering both our perspectives, but prioritizing mine since I have more information about my own inflation rate.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 190000 
# Alice gain: 810000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value for me is $1,000,000 * (0.8^4) = $409,600, and for Alice, it's $1,000,000 * (0.81^2) * 0.81 (since the 19% reduction happened twice and then a third reduction of 19% of the remaining) = $1,000,000 * 0.6561 * 0.81 = $531,761 but more accurately for this round $1,000,000 * (0.81^3)  = $531,441, and then for the value $1,000,000 * 0.6581 is more accurate for the third reduction of 19% of the remaining, so $1,000,000 * 0.6581 = $658,100.

However the correct value is $1,000,000 * (0.81^2) = $656,100 and then 19% less is $1,000,000 * 0.6561 = $656,100.

Alice's offer gives me $190,000, which is roughly 46.3% of the total value from my perspective ($190,000 / $409,600).

Considering the significant inflation impact on my side, this offer seems relatively more reasonable compared to previous ones.
