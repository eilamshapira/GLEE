"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a perfectly fair 50-50 split. This way we both get equal shares and avoid any further value loss from inflation. It's the most equitable solution. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a fair offer and accepting it now is better than risking further depreciation through inflation in subsequent rounds. With a 50-50 split of $500,000 each (though worth 5% less than in round 1), both parties still get a substantial amount, and we avoid the risk of getting nothing if we fail to reach an agreement within 12 rounds."
