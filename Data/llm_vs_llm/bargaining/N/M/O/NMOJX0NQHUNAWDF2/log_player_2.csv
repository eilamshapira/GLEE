"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a fair split where I get slightly more as the first mover. This way we both walk away with a substantial amount without risking inflation losses. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me $450,000, which is a substantial amount. However, she's taking a larger share ($550,000) justifying it with first-mover advantage. 

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but:
1. The total amount will decrease by 5% (to $950,000)
2. Alice could reject my offer, leading to further rounds and more value loss
3. Even with the 5% loss, I could potentially negotiate a better split

Given that this is just the first round and I could potentially get a more equitable split despite some inflation loss, I'll reject this offer.
