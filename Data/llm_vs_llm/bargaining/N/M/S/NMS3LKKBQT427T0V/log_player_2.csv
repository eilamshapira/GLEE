"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's proposal gives me $400,000 and her $600,000. This isn't an equal split, but I need to consider the inflation factor. Since the money doesn't lose value for me across rounds, but loses 5% value each round for Alice, I have a strategic advantage by rejecting and making my own offer next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair offer considering the inflation factor. Since Alice faces 5% inflation per round, she should be more motivated to accept a reasonable offer now rather than wait.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose an equal split of the million dollars. This is fair and reasonable, giving us both the same amount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has improved her offer, now giving me $450,000 instead of the initial $400,000. However, I still have the inflation advantage, and there are many rounds left. Since the money doesn't lose value for me but continues to lose value for Alice with each round, I can likely get an even better deal by continuing.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a somewhat more favorable offer for myself, but still reasonable enough that Alice might accept given her inflation disadvantage. She already faces nearly 10% inflation, and waiting another round would make it worse for her.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I propose I receive $550,000 and Alice receives $450,000. This offer acknowledges the inflation pressure Alice faces while being fair enough that we can conclude this negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has improved her offer again, now offering me $480,000. This is trending in my favor as the rounds continue. With the money worth 18.55% less to her now but still the same value to me, I still have leverage. There are 7 more rounds possible, and her inflation disadvantage will continue to grow.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that Alice is now facing over 18% inflation and has rejected my previous offer, I'll adjust my proposal to be slightly more favorable to me while still being reasonable enough that she might accept to avoid further inflation losses.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I propose I receive $600,000 and Alice receives $400,000. With the increasing inflation pressure Alice faces and the limited number of rounds remaining, this offer provides a reasonable opportunity for us to reach an agreement."
