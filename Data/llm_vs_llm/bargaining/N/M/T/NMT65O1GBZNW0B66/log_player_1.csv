"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split that slightly favors me since Bob has the power to accept or reject. I want to make it attractive enough for Bob to accept rather than move to the next round.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose to take $5,500 for myself and give $4,500 to Bob. This is a reasonable split that gives Bob a significant portion while acknowledging my position as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Due to 10% inflation for me, if I accept $5000, it's effectively worth $4500 to me
2. Bob is offering an equal split, which seems fair on the surface
3. If I reject, I can make another offer, but:
   - The money will be worth even less (20% less for me in the next round)
   - Bob might reject again, further reducing value
4. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush - better to secure a decent amount now than risk further devaluation
