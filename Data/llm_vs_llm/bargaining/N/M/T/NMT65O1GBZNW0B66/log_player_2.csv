"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer. She's proposing to give me $4,500 while she takes $5,500 of the $10,000.

If I reject, I'll get to make a counter-offer in the next round, but the money will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation, meaning the $10,000 would effectively be worth $9,500 to me. 

If I accept now, I get $4,500. If I reject and propose a better split for myself next round, I would need to get more than $4,500 after accounting for the 5% inflation to make rejecting worthwhile.

This isn't a terrible first offer, but I think I can do better by making a counter-proposal, even accounting for the inflation penalty.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that's fair but accounts for the inflation I'm facing.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I suggest an even 50-50 split. This is a fair division that gives us both equal shares of the money. Since I'm facing inflation with each round, I think it's reasonable to aim for an equal distribution."
