"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly. I'll give you a guaranteed 100k, and you get to keep the rest. It's a good deal considering the stakes! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, and 10% less for Alice, I'll take that into consideration for my offer.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, considering the decreasing value. This split seems more balanced, don't you think?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, you're playing hardball. Let's try this. I'm offering you 400k, which is a decent sum. Take it, or we risk getting even less. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the decreasing value of the money, I need to weigh my options carefully. Since the money I gain is worth 36% less than in the first round, the actual value of Alice's offer to me is approximately 400000 * (1 - 0.36) = 256000.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, and I've already gone through 3 rounds, the total decrease in value for me is 20% + 20% + 20% = 48.4% (compounded). The money I gain is now worth approximately 51.6% of its original value.

For Alice, the money is worth 10% less with each passing round, so after 3 rounds, the total decrease in value for her is 10% + 10% + 10% = 27.1% (compounded). The money she gains is now worth approximately 72.9% of its original value.

Considering this, I'll make an offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.
