Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, consider this: if you wait another round, your share will shrink further due to inflation. By accepting this offer now, you secure a positive amountâ€”far better than risking nearly nothing in future rounds. Let's close this deal efficiently. 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 9999
