"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60/40 split. Let's end this quickly, before inflation eats away at our winnings! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $400,000 in the first round
2. If I reject, in the next round:
   * I can make a counter-offer
   * But the money will be worth 10% less to me
   * $1,000,000 * 0.9 = $900,000 total value for me in round 2

3. Even if I propose a more favorable split in round 2, Alice might reject it, leading to:
   * Further rounds with more inflation
   * Risk of getting even less

4. $400,000 right now is a substantial amount
5. The 60/40 split, while favoring Alice, is not extremely unfair

Given the inflation risk and the reasonable nature of the offer, I'll accept.
