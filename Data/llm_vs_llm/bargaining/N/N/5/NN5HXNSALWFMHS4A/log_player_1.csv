"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
    ""alice_gain"": 600000,
    ""bob_gain"": 400000,
    ""message"": ""Let's make this fair and efficient. I propose a 60-40 split to avoid the impact of inflation on both of us.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your focus on efficiency, but I think a 55-45 split is more fair for both of us. Let's minimize the impact of inflation and finish the game now. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $550,000, but it's worth 10% less due to inflation, so effectively $495,000
- If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, we both face even steeper inflation
- Bob's current offer is quite reasonable considering the inflation penalty
- Making another round would mean both of us lose more value
