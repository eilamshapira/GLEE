"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 60%, you get 40%. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but I believe my contributions are worth at least 60%. This seems fair.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit, but 60% is still too much for you. How about 5400 for me and 4600 for you? It's a fair split considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

This offer gives me slightly less than my previous offer, but the difference is fairly small considering the inflation. It's better to take this offer than risk getting even less in future rounds.
