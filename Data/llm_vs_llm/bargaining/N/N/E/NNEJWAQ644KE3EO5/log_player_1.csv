"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think an equal 50/50 split would be fair for both of us. We each get $5000. Since there's no inflation pressure on my side, I'm comfortable negotiating for a fair share, and I believe this is the fairest division possible. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
