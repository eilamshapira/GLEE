"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take a big chunk, but I'm leaving you something. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Alice's offer, where she's proposing I get $1,000 while she takes $9,000. While I appreciate that she's offering me something, this is a very uneven split of the $10,000.

Since there's no inflation for me (0% less each round), I have no pressure to accept quickly. I can reject this offer and make my own proposal in the next round without losing value.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split that's fair to both of us.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I think an equal 50/50 split would be fair for both of us. We each get $5,000. Since there's no inflation pressure on my side, I'm comfortable negotiating for a fair share, and I believe this is the fairest division possible.""}"
