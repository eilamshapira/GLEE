"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice's offer gives me a substantial amount, it's not an even split. Since we have plenty of rounds left, I can try to negotiate for a fairer division.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a perfectly fair split, which would be most equitable for both of us.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}"
