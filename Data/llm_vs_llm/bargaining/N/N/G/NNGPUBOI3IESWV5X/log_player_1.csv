"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer in Round 1 wasn't terrible, but it slightly favored you. Let's be fair - I propose a 55/45 split.  This accounts for the inflation working against you in future rounds, giving you a good incentive to accept now. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
