"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
- Alice is offering me $100,000 out of $1,000,000
- If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
- However, money will be worth 20% less for me next round
- For Alice, it will only be worth 5% less
- $100,000 now is better than $120,000 that's worth 20% less next round
- However, this offer is quite unfair, and I have many rounds left to negotiate
- Given the large disparity and that it's early in the game, I should try to negotiate for more

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since this is my turn, I'll make a more balanced offer. I need to consider that:
- We both need to agree to get anything
- Alice's money devalues more slowly (5% vs my 20%)
- A fair split would give me some advantage to compensate for my higher inflation rate
- But I can't be too greedy or Alice will likely reject

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}
""I propose a 60-40 split in my favor to account for my higher inflation rate"""
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- Alice has increased her offer from $100K to $200K
- However, due to inflation, $200K now is worth only $128K in round 1 value for me (64% of $200K)
- Alice's $800K is worth about $722K in round 1 value for her (90.25% of $800K)
- If I reject, the next round my money will be worth even less (down another 20%)
- While this is still not a great offer, inflation is seriously eating into my potential gains
- Alice seems to be using the inflation difference strategically
- I still have 9 rounds left, but each round makes my position weaker

Given that my bargaining power decreases much faster than Alice's, and this offer is better than the first one, I should accept.
