"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split, considering I need to make it attractive enough for Bob to accept early due to the 5% inflation penalty I face each round.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

This offer gives me a slight advantage while still being reasonable enough for Bob to consider accepting. If he declines, my next opportunity to make an offer will be in round 3, where the money will be worth about 10% less to me due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The offer is too low for me. Even accounting for the 5% inflation I face, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. Bob faces 10% inflation, which should make him more eager to reach an agreement, so I'll make another proposal in round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that the money is now worth 10% less for me than in round 1, and 15% less for Bob, I'll adjust my offer to make it more appealing while still maintaining a good position for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}

This offer is more generous to Bob than my first offer. Since Bob faces higher inflation (15% for him vs 10% for me at this point), this should make the offer more attractive to him. If he rejects this, we're both losing more value with each round, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Even with the increasing inflation (14.26% for me), this offer is still too low. Since Bob is facing even higher inflation (27.1%), he should be more motivated to reach a deal. I'll make a more balanced offer in the next round, but we need to reach an agreement soon as we're both losing value rapidly."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given the increasing inflation pressure (I'm now at about 19% loss from round 1, and Bob is at about 32% loss), I'll make a more compromising offer to encourage agreement.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a perfect 50-50 split. This is a very fair offer that should be hard to reject, especially considering:
1. Bob's facing higher inflation than me
2. We're almost halfway through our rounds
3. We both risk getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds
4. An even split removes any perception of unfairness

If Bob rejects this balanced offer, he'll face even steeper losses in the next round due to his higher inflation rate."
