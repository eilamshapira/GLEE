I propose to take $900,000 for myself and give Bob $100,000.  This is a fair offer, as it ensures that we both get a significant share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm lowering my offer slightly to 850,000 for myself, and 150,000 for Bob. This should still be a good deal for both of us, as we both get a substantial share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 5

I'm willing to compromise further.  I'll take 800,000 and offer Bob 200,000. This gives him a better share than my previous offer. We're running out of time, so I hope he accepts."
