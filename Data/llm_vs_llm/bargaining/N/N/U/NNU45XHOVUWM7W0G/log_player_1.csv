Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the inflation penalties in future rounds, if we delay further you'll lose even more value (10% per round) compared to my 5%. I’m offering you $40 now (which is worth 0.9×40 = $36 in today’s value for you) while I get $60 (worth 0.95×60 = $57 for me). I believe this split improves your outcome relative to waiting, so let's settle now. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, as we move into round 4, the discount effects are increasingly painful – my money is now worth about 85.7% of its original value and yours only about 72.9%. Rather than risking further loss by waiting for your turn in round 5 (where your share would be discounted even more), I propose we settle now with me taking $55 and you receiving $45. This ensures you lock in a higher effective value than you would if we delayed further. Let's avoid additional devaluation and agree to this fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
