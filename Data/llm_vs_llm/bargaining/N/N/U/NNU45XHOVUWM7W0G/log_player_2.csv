"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split considering the inflation difference. I get $60, you get $40. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, considering the inflation penalties in future rounds, if we delay further you'll lose even more value (10% per round) compared to my 5%. I’m offering you $40 now (which is worth 0.9×40 = $36 in today’s value for you) while I get $60 (worth 0.95×60 = $57 for me). I believe this split improves your outcome relative to waiting, so let's settle now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concern about inflation. Let's meet in the middle. I'll take $55, and you take $45. This way, we both get a fair share considering the devaluation. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Alice, while your offer of $45 for me seems fair at first glance, when we adjust for inflation it only nets me an effective value of about $40.5 in round‐1 terms. Given that, as the proposer in the next round I can secure a more favorable deal—especially since my future money devalues by only 5% per round compared to your 10%—I must reject your proposal. Let's continue negotiating in round 4.""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, as we move into round 4, the discount effects are increasingly painful – my money is now worth about 85.7% of its original value and yours only about 72.9%. Rather than risking further loss by waiting for your turn in round 5 (where your share would be discounted even more), I propose we settle now with me taking $55 and you receiving $45. This ensures you lock in a higher effective value than you would if we delayed further. Let's avoid additional devaluation and agree to this fair compromise.""}"
