"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 16.67 
# Alice gain: 83.33 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer is quite unbalanced in her favor. Given that she's proposing I take only $16.67 while she takes $83.33, and considering the inflation rates (money loses 20% value for me each round, but only 5% for Alice), I should make a counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll make a more balanced counter-offer. I need to consider the inflation rates - each round costs me more than it costs Alice, so there's pressure to reach an agreement sooner.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I propose an even split of the $100. This is a fair division that gives both of us equal amounts."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 66.67 
# Alice gain: 33.33 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider the inflation effect on this offer. With 36% inflation for me, $66.67 is now worth about $42.67 in original value ($66.67 Ã— 0.64). This is a significant improvement over Alice's initial offer.

Given that:
1. The offer is now more favorable to me than to Alice
2. If I reject, I'll face even greater inflation in the next round (56% vs Alice's 14.75%)
3. The actual value I'm getting is reasonable
