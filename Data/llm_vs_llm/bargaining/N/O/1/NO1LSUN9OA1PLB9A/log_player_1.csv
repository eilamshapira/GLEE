Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Consider that if you reject this offer, your share will be worth 10% less in the next round. This offer gives you $4000 now, which is better than getting $4500 or less later. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
