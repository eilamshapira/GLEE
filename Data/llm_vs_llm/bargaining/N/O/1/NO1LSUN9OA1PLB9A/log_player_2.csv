"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we both benefit equally. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice offered a 50-50 split ($5000 each). While this might seem fair at first glance, I have an advantage here because Alice faces a 10% depreciation per round while I don't face any depreciation.

If I reject this offer and make a counter-offer in the next round, Alice's $5000 would only be worth $4500 to her. This means I could potentially negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round, as Alice would be more inclined to accept a less equal split to avoid further depreciation of her share.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice faces 10% depreciation per round and I don't, I can propose a split that's more favorable to me while still being attractive enough for Alice to accept (rather than risk further depreciation in the next round).

If Alice rejects my offer, her share would depreciate another 10% in the next round. I should propose a split that makes accepting now better than waiting for the next round.

{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Consider that if you reject this offer, your share will be worth 10% less in the next round. This offer gives you $4000 now, which is better than getting $4500 or less later.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering the inflation affecting my share, I'm proposing $4500 for me and $5500 for you. This is a compromise from my side given the diminishing value of money for me. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $5500, which is a better deal than her initial 50-50 split
2. Her $4500 is actually worth only $3645 to her (due to 19% depreciation)
3. If I reject this offer:
   - We go to round 4 where I can make an offer
   - Alice's share will depreciate by 29% (10% more)
   - I could try to get more, but Alice might reject again
   - This could lead to a cycle of rejections where we both lose value

The offer is reasonably good for me, and continuing the negotiation might lead to diminishing returns or risk of further rejections. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk a worse outcome.
