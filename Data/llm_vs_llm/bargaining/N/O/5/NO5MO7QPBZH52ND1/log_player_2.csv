"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split.  I'll take 60% and you get 40%. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me 4000$ (40% of 10,000$)
2. If I reject, we go to next round where:
   - I can make my own proposal
   - But my money will be worth 10% less
   - Current offer value after inflation: 4000$ â†’ 3600$

While a 50-50 split might seem more ""fair"", the 10% inflation penalty makes rejecting risky. If Alice rejects my counter-offer, my eventual gain could be even lower due to inflation.
