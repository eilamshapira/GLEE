1900.0,8100.0,"Hi Alice – I appreciate your promptness. In round 3 (if you were to propose), the equilibrium suggests you’d secure about $1900. To keep things efficient (and given my money loses a bit more value as we delay), I propose $1900 for you and $8100 for me. Let’s settle now and avoid further discounting on my end.",Bob,2,
