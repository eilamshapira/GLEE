"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice – I appreciate your promptness. In round 3 (if you were to propose), the equilibrium suggests you’d secure about $1900. To keep things efficient (and given my money loses a bit more value as we delay), I propose $1900 for you and $8100 for me. Let’s settle now and avoid further discounting on my end. 
# Alice gain: 1900 
# Bob gain: 8100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
