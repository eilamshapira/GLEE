"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Let's get this done quickly. I'm offering you $3000 to start. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 8100, ""alice_gain"": 1900, ""message"": ""Hi Alice – I appreciate your promptness. In round 3 (if you were to propose), the equilibrium suggests you’d secure about $1900. To keep things efficient (and given my money loses a bit more value as we delay), I propose $1900 for you and $8100 for me. Let’s settle now and avoid further discounting on my end.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's try this again. I'm offering you $4000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the inflation. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
