"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to divide the $10,000 with Bob, keeping in mind that inflation affects my portion with each passing round.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split of the $10,000. This gives us both $5,000, which is equitable. If we move to another round, my portion loses 10% value due to inflation, so it's in my interest to settle now. A fair split now is better than risking further rounds.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I'm willing to take a bit more risk. I propose I get $5500 and you get $4500. This way, I'm taking a bit more to compensate for the inflation risk I'm facing. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
