"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split of the $10000. This gives us both $5000, which is equitable. If we move to another round, my portion loses 10% value due to inflation, so it's in my interest to settle now. A fair split now is better than risking further rounds. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I'm willing to take a bit more risk. I propose I get $5500 and you get $4500. This way, I'm taking a bit more to compensate for the inflation risk I'm facing.""}"
