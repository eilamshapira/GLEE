"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing I get $40 while she gets $60. With inflation reducing the value by 20% each round for me, if I reject now, the total amount will effectively be worth less in future rounds. If I propose in the next round, we'd be dividing the same $100, but it would be worth less to me due to inflation.

Let me analyze: $40 now is better than potentially getting a higher percentage of a less valuable pot later. Given the inflation pressure, I should lean toward accepting reasonable offers early.
