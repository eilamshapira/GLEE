Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,""bob_gain"": 40,""message"": ""Let's start off fairly. I hope we can agree on this division!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since waiting costs you 5% each round, this is a fair offer that gives you $45 now rather than less value later. I suggest we conclude the deal here. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
