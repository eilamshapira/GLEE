"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start off fairly. I hope we can agree on this division! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
- She's offering me $40 and keeping $60
- If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
- For Alice, the money will be worth 5% less next round
- For me, there's no inflation penalty

Since Alice will face a 5% penalty next round, I can likely negotiate a better deal for myself. The current split (40/60) favors her too much given the inflation dynamics.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice faces a 5% penalty per round, I'll propose a more favorable split for me, but still reasonable enough that she might accept rather than risk further devaluation.

{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Since waiting costs you 5% each round, this is a fair offer that gives you $45 now rather than less value later. I suggest we conclude the deal here.""}"
