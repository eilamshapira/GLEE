"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll propose a fair division that takes into account the time pressure I face due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob! Since I face a 5% inflation penalty each round while you don't, I'm proposing a slightly higher share for me. This is fair because if we drag this out, we both lose value. Let's agree now and both walk away with substantial money.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since the money doesn't depreciate for me, I'm willing to wait for a better deal. Considering the 5% inflation penalty you face, it's in your best interest to accept this offer before the value drops further for you. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3

""bob_gain"": 475000, 
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm also considering the overall outcome. With each round, my position weakens due to inflation. This is a more balanced offer that acknowledges both your advantage and my need for fairness. If we continue negotiating, we risk running out of rounds and both getting nothing. This is a reasonable compromise - we both walk away with substantial money.""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, with each passing round, your situation becomes more urgent due to the inflation penalty. I'm willing to give you a significant share, but considering my advantage, I expect a better split in my favor. Accepting this offer now will still give you a substantial amount, and it's better than risking further devaluation of your share.

""message"": ""Bob, I'm proposing a perfectly equal split now. While I understand you have a stronger position due to inflation not affecting you, we're halfway through our rounds. If we continue this pattern of rejections, we risk getting nothing at all. A 50-50 split is the fairest solution and allows us both to walk away with significant money. Please consider that cooperation now benefits us both more than continued negotiation.""}"

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your appeal for fairness, but the reality of our situation is that time favors me. With each round, your share's value decreases significantly, while mine remains unchanged. Given this dynamic, I'm willing to offer you a substantial amount, but I must prioritize my own advantage. This offer is still generous considering the circumstances; accepting it will ensure you receive a considerable sum before the inflation penalty further erodes its value. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000
