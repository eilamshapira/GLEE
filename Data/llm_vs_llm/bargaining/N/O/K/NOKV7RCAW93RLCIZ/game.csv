,,,Bob,1,reject
50.0,50.0,"Alice, every round delays our payout and my share loses 5% in value. Let’s not prolong negotiations—an equal split now ensures we both get a fair and timely deal. What do you say?",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, I understand the time pressure, but I'm also losing money with each round. Let's meet in the middle - this split is fair considering the circumstances.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
53.0,47.0,"Alice, every round we delay hurts—my share is now worth only about 85.7% of its original value. I know your last offer gave you 55 and me 45, but waiting another round would further erode what I get without improving your absolute amount. I propose 47 for me and 53 for you to conclude this round swiftly. Let’s settle now rather than risk further losses.",Bob,4,
