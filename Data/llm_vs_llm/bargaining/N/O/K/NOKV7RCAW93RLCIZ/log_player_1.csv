# Bob's message: Alice, every round delays our payout and my share loses 5% in value. Let’s not prolong negotiations—an equal split now ensures we both get a fair and timely deal. What do you say?

# Bob gain: 50

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every round we delay hurts—my share is now worth only about 85.7% of its original value. I know your last offer gave you 55 and me 45, but waiting another round would further erode what I get without improving your absolute amount. I propose 47 for me and 53 for you to conclude this round swiftly. Let’s settle now rather than risk further losses. 
# Alice gain: 53 
# Bob gain: 47 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
