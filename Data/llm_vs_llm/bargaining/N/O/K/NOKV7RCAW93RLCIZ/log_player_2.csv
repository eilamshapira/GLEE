Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the time pressure, but I'm also losing money with each round. Let's meet in the middle - this split is fair considering the circumstances.

# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 47, ""alice_gain"": 53, ""message"": ""Alice, every round we delay hurts—my share is now worth only about 85.7% of its original value. I know your last offer gave you 55 and me 45, but waiting another round would further erode what I get without improving your absolute amount. I propose 47 for me and 53 for you to conclude this round swiftly. Let’s settle now rather than risk further losses.""}"
