"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a strategic first offer. Since Bob faces a 20% depreciation per round, he has an incentive to accept a reasonable offer now rather than wait.

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I propose taking $70 and giving Bob $30. This is enough that Bob should seriously consider accepting it, as waiting a round would make any future money worth 20% less to him, while it doesn't affect my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept:
- I get $55 (full value)
- Bob gets $45 (at 80% value = $36 effective value for him)

2. If I reject:
- We go to next round where I can make a new offer
- For Bob, money will be worth only 60% of original value
- I maintain full value

Given that:
1. My bargaining position gets stronger each round due to Bob's inflation
2. I can likely get a better deal in the next round
3. $55 is less than my initial offer of $70

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's money is now worth only 60% of its original value to him, I can make a stronger offer in my favor. Any future rounds will make Bob's position even weaker as his money will be worth only 40% in the next round.

{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}

I propose taking $80 and giving Bob $20. For Bob, $20 at 60% value means $12 in effective value. If he rejects and we go another round, his money will be worth even less (40%), so this offer should be more compelling to him than waiting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept:
- I get $60 (full value)
- Bob gets $40 (at 40% value = $16 effective value for him)

2. If I reject:
- We go to next round where I can make a new offer
- For Bob, money will be worth only 20% of original value
- I maintain full value

Given that:
1. Bob's money is rapidly losing value (will be worth only 20% next round)
2. My bargaining position is extremely strong
3. $60 is still less than what I could likely get next round
4. I previously offered $80/$20 split

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I can likely get a much better deal in the next round given Bob's severe inflation penalty."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","At this point, Bob's money is only worth 20% of its original value to him. This gives me extremely strong bargaining power. If he rejects this offer, his money will be practically worthless in the next round (worth 0%). Therefore, he has a very strong incentive to accept this offer.

{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I propose taking $90 and giving Bob $10. For Bob, $10 at 20% value means $2 in effective value. While this might seem aggressive, it's actually rational for Bob to accept this rather than risk getting even less value in the next round when his money would be worth nothing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept:
- I get $65 (full value)
- Bob gets $35 (at ~33% value â‰ˆ $11.5 effective value for him)

2. If I reject:
- We go to next round where I can make a new offer
- For Bob, money will be worth almost nothing (approaching 0% of original value)
- I maintain full value

Given that:
1. Bob's money is now worth only about a third of its original value
2. I can make an even more extreme offer next round that Bob would likely have to accept
3. $65 is significantly less than my last offer of $90
4. Bob's bargaining position is extremely weak

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer because I can likely get a much better deal in the next round, as Bob's money will be worth almost nothing to him."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","At this point, Bob's money is worth virtually nothing to him (less than 20% of original value), and if he rejects this offer, it will be worth even less next round. This gives me maximum bargaining power. There's almost no rational reason for Bob to reject this offer given his severe inflation penalty.

{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}

I propose taking $95 and giving Bob $5. While this may seem extreme, it's actually rational for Bob to accept this rather than continue to the next round where his money would be worth even less. Even a small amount now is better than a larger amount that's worth practically nothing due to his severe inflation penalty."
