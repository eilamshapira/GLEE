45.0,55.0,"Okay Alice, since you were so generous last round, how about we split it 55/45 this time? My offer is better for me since the money is worth less now!",Bob,2,

40.0,60.0,"Alice, this is the best offer you'll get. I'm proposing 60/40. Inflation is eating away at the value, and I need a bigger share to make it worth my time. Take it or leave it!",Bob,4,
