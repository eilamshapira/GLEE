"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split this fairly, Bob. A slight advantage for me now means you'll be more eager to strike a deal in later rounds. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $4,500
2. If I reject and we go to the next round, the money will be worth 10% less to me
3. In the next round, I could propose a better split, but even if I proposed 50-50:
   * $5,000 would only be worth $4,500 to me due to the 10% inflation
   * And Alice might reject that anyway, leading to further rounds and more inflation

Alice is actually making a reasonable offer, considering the inflation penalty I face. If we continue to later rounds, I might end up with less value due to the inflation effect, even if I get a nominally larger amount.
