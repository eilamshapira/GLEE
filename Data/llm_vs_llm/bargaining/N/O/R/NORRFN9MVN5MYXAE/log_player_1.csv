"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a split that accounts for the different inflation rates we face. Since my inflation rate (10%) is higher than Bob's (5%), I should aim for a fair but slightly higher initial share to compensate.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split where I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000. This is a reasonable first offer that acknowledges both our needs while giving Bob a substantial portion. Given that my money will lose value faster than his in future rounds, this split is fair and should be acceptable to both parties."
