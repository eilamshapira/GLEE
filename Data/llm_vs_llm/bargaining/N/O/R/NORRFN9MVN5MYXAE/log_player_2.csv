"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $450,000 and keeping $550,000 for herself
2. If I reject, we'll move to round 2, where:
   * My money will be worth 5% less
   * Her money will be worth 10% less
   * I'll get to make the next offer

If I reject, $450,000 would be worth $427,500 to me in the next round. However, I could potentially make a better offer since Alice's value will decrease more quickly than mine.

Given that:
- The offer is relatively fair (45/55 split)
- Inflation will hurt both of us if we continue
- There's risk in prolonging negotiations
- First-round acceptance ensures we both get significant value
