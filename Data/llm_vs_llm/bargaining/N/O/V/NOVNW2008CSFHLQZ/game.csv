550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, considering that my money loses 10% value each round, I propose this fair division where you get a substantial portion of the money right now. Let's avoid haggling and settle this efficiently, as it benefits both of us.",Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,"Hi Alice, since you face a 10% depreciation per round while I don't, waiting is more costly for you than for me. This offer gives you $400000 now, which is worth more than what you'd get in future rounds after depreciation. This is a fair split considering the asymmetric inflation, and we can both walk away with a significant amount rather than risking further rounds.",Bob,2,

500000.0,500000.0,"Bob, I understand your reasoning, but your offer was clearly taking too much advantage of my inflation penalty. Let's be fair and do a 50-50 split. If we continue negotiating, both of us risk getting less than we could have - I lose value through inflation, and you risk getting a smaller absolute amount if we keep going back and forth. This balanced offer is the most rational solution for both of us.",Alice,3,
