"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, considering that my money loses 10% value each round, I propose this fair division where you get a substantial portion of the money right now. Let's avoid haggling and settle this efficiently, as it benefits both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since you face a 10% depreciation per round while I don't, waiting is more costly for you than for me. This offer gives you $400000 now, which is worth more than what you'd get in future rounds after depreciation. This is a fair split considering the asymmetric inflation, and we can both walk away with a significant amount rather than risking further rounds. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Bob, I understand your reasoning, but your offer was clearly taking too much advantage of my inflation penalty. Let's be fair and do a 50-50 split. If we continue negotiating, both of us risk getting less than we could have - I lose value through inflation, and you risk getting a smaller absolute amount if we keep going back and forth. This balanced offer is the most rational solution for both of us.""}"
