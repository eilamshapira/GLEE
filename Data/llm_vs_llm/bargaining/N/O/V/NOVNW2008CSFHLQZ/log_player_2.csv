"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, considering that my money loses 10% value each round, I propose this fair division where you get a substantial portion of the money right now. Let's avoid haggling and settle this efficiently, as it benefits both of us. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Alice's offer to split the money with me receiving $450,000 and her receiving $550,000.

Let me analyze this situation:
- If I reject, we go to the next round where I can make a counter-offer
- Each round, Alice's money loses 10% value, while mine remains the same
- This gives me negotiating leverage in later rounds
- If I make a counter-offer, Alice may accept a deal more favorable to me since her portion would be worth less to her in the next round

While $450,000 is a substantial amount, I believe I can propose a more favorable split in the next round given the inflation asymmetry.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll craft a reasonable counter-offer that takes into account the inflation asymmetry while still being attractive enough for Alice to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, since you face a 10% depreciation per round while I don't, waiting is more costly for you than for me. This offer gives you $400,000 now, which is worth more than what you'd get in future rounds after depreciation. This is a fair split considering the asymmetric inflation, and we can both walk away with a significant amount rather than risking further rounds.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your reasoning, but your offer was clearly taking too much advantage of my inflation penalty. Let's be fair and do a 50-50 split. If we continue negotiating, both of us risk getting less than we could have - I lose value through inflation, and you risk getting a smaller absolute amount if we keep going back and forth. This balanced offer is the most rational solution for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Alice's new offer of a 50-50 split ($500,000 each).

Let me analyze the situation:
- Alice has rejected my previous offer of $600,000 for me and $400,000 for her
- We're now in round 3, and Alice's money is worth 19% less to her than in round 1
- If I reject again, we'll move to round 4 where I can make another offer
- In round 4, Alice's money would be worth even less to her (about 27% less than round 1)
- This gives me increasing leverage, but also risks extending negotiations

Alice's 50-50 split is better than her initial offer of $450,000 to me. While I could potentially get more by continuing, there's also a risk of prolonged negotiations. A 50-50 split is objectively fair in absolute terms, though the inflation dynamics do give me some advantage.
