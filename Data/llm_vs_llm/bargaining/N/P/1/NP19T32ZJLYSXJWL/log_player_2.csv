"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $450,000 (45%) and keeping $550,000 (55%) for herself
2. If I reject, we'll move to round 2, but:
   - My money will be worth 10% less
   - Her money will be worth 5% less
3. $450,000 now is better than potentially getting more in future rounds due to the higher depreciation rate on my side
4. While not exactly 50-50, it's a reasonable first offer
5. The risk of prolonged negotiation could lead to significant value loss for both parties

Given these factors, especially considering my higher depreciation rate, I'll accept this offer.
