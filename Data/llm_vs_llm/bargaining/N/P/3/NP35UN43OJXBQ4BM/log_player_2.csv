"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice has proposed a 50-50 split of the $1,000,000. This would give me $500,000 and Alice $500,000.

Given that inflation reduces the value by 20% each round for me, if I reject this offer and we go to the next round, the total amount would still be $1,000,000 but it would be worth less to me. If I make a counter-offer in round 2, even if I propose taking more, the 20% inflation would mean I'd need to get at least $625,000 just to match the current value of $500,000.

Since this is a fair initial offer and inflation works against me, I'll accept.
