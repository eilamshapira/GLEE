8333.0,1667.0,"Hi Bob, I'd like to propose the following division: I take $8333 and you get $1667. Given the time sensitivity—since every round reduces the value by 5% for me and 20% for you—this deal is designed to be fair to both. Accepting now maximizes your return compared to waiting. Looking forward to your response!",Alice,1,

4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  The value of the money is decreasing for me significantly. Take it or leave it.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, thanks for the updated proposal. Given the inflation effects on my share, your offer of $4000 for me (which is worth 5% less than the round‐1 value, translating effectively to about $3800) is above my alternative if I waited for my turn in the next round. I’m happy to accept your 60/40 split proposal as it provides me a better effective payoff than continuing the negotiation.",Alice,2,accept
