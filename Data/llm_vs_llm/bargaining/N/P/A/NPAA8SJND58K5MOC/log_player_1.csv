"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 8333, ""bob_gain"": 1667, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'd like to propose the following division: I take $8,333 and you get $1,667. Given the time sensitivity—since every round reduces the value by 5% for me and 20% for you—this deal is designed to be fair to both. Accepting now maximizes your return compared to waiting. Looking forward to your response!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  The value of the money is decreasing for me significantly. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the updated proposal. Given the inflation effects on my share, your offer of $4,000 for me (which is worth 5% less than the round‐1 value, translating effectively to about $3,800) is above my alternative if I waited for my turn in the next round. I’m happy to accept your 60/40 split proposal as it provides me a better effective payoff than continuing the negotiation.""}"
