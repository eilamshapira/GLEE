"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'd like to propose the following division: I take $8333 and you get $1667. Given the time sensitivity—since every round reduces the value by 5% for me and 20% for you—this deal is designed to be fair to both. Accepting now maximizes your return compared to waiting. Looking forward to your response! 
# Bob gain: 1667 
# Alice gain: 8333
