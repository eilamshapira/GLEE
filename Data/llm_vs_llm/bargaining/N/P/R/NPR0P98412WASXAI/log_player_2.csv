"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Alice in each round, I'll take that into account for my offer.

The total value of the money after the first round for me is: $1,000,000 * 0.95 = $950,000
The total value of the money after the first round for Alice is: $1,000,000 * 0.9 = $900,000

I'll make an offer that is more favorable to me.
