450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. This is fair because your inflation rate is much higher (20% vs my 5%), so waiting another round would cost you significantly more. If you reject this offer and we go to round 3, the $1M would be worth 20% less to you again, so your portion of the money would lose substantial value. This offer maximizes our joint outcome given our different inflation rates.",Bob,2,
