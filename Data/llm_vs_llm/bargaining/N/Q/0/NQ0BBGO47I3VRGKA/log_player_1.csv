Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. This is fair because your inflation rate is much higher (20% vs my 5%), so waiting another round would cost you significantly more. If you reject this offer and we go to round 3, the $1M would be worth 20% less to you again, so your portion of the money would lose substantial value. This offer maximizes our joint outcome given our different inflation rates. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
