"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60/40 split. This is a generous offer, considering the rapid inflation for me. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $400,000 while she takes $600,000. 

While she claims this is generous due to her higher inflation rate (20% per round versus my 5%), I should evaluate whether waiting for the next round would be advantageous for me.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value will decrease, but I'll have the advantage of making the proposal. The money would be worth 5% less to me and 20% less to Alice in the next round.

I think I can propose a more favorable split in the next round that Alice would likely accept due to her higher inflation penalty.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that takes into account our different inflation rates.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. This is fair because your inflation rate is much higher (20% vs my 5%), so waiting another round would cost you significantly more. If you reject this offer and we go to round 3, the $1M would be worth 20% less to you again, so your portion of the money would lose substantial value. This offer maximizes our joint outcome given our different inflation rates.""}"
