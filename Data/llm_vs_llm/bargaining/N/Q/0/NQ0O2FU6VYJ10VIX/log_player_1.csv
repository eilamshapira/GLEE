"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we divide the $100 as $60 for me and $40 for you. Accepting now ensures we both secure almost full value, whereas delaying means I lose 10% per round. Letâ€™s agree and finish quickly!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better.  I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor.  This is fairer, and with inflation, it's in your best interest to accept now. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
