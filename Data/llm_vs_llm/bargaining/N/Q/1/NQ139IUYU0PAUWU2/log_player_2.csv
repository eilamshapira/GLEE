"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to agree quickly due to inflation affecting our gains. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100, keeping $60 for herself. 

If I reject, we move to round 2, where I can make a counter-offer. However, due to 10% inflation, the money will be worth less to me in the next round. After one round of inflation, $100 would effectively be worth $90 to me.

While a 50-50 split might seem more fair, the inflation penalty makes waiting costly. If I reject and we go back and forth too much, we could both end up with nothing.

$40 right now is better than potentially getting a larger nominal amount that's worth less due to inflation, or risking getting nothing if we can't agree within 12 rounds.
