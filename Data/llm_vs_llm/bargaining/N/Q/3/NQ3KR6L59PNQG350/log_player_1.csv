Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, given the ongoing inflation and to end this quickly, I propose a 50-50 split. It's fair and considers the diminishing value of money for me. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While I would prefer a 55-45 split, accepting a 50-50 split in Round 4 is a strategic move. Here's why:

* **Guaranteed Payout:** Accepting ensures I receive $500,000, which is a significant sum. 
* **Inflation Impact:**  Bob's gains are now worth considerably less due to inflation. While my gains remain unaffected, there's a risk he might propose even less favorable terms in future rounds.
* **Time Value of Money:** Prolonging the game has the potential for diminished returns, especially if future offers become increasingly less appealing. 

Therefore, accepting a 50-50 split in Round 4 secures a reasonable payout while minimizing potential losses due to inflation and prolonged negotiations."
