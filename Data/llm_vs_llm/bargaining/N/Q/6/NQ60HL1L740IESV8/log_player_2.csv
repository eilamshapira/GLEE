"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically. Alice is offering me $40, keeping $60 for herself. While this isn't an equal split, it's a substantial amount. However, since this is just the first round and we have 11 more rounds available, I can try to negotiate for a fairer split.

I'll reject this offer and propose a more equitable distribution in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair and equitable split, slightly in my favor since Alice tried to take more in the first round.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I suggest we split it $55 for me and $45 for you, which is more balanced than your previous offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has moved towards a more balanced split, offering me $45 instead of the initial $40. This is close to an equal split, but since she rejected my previous offer and we still have 9 rounds left, I think there's room for further negotiation towards a more equitable 50-50 split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose an equal split this time. This is the fairest solution, and there's no rational reason for Alice to reject it.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I propose we split it equally - $50 each. This is fair for both of us."
