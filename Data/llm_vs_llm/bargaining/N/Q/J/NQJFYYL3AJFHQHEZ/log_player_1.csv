"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a split that takes into account the different inflation rates affecting both players. Since Bob's money devalues faster (20% per round) compared to mine (10% per round), he has more incentive to accept a reasonable offer early.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering the game dynamics. This gives Bob a substantial $400,000 while acknowledging my slightly stronger negotiating position due to the differential inflation rates."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept Bob's offer now:
   * I get $450,000 × 0.9 = $405,000 in round 1 value
   * Bob gets $550,000 × 0.8 = $440,000 in round 1 value

2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make another offer, but the money will be worth even less for both of us
   * For me: -10% more (worth 81% of original)
   * For Bob: -20% more (worth 64% of original)

Given that the current offer gives me a decent amount in real value ($405,000), and considering that further delays will significantly reduce the value for both of us, I will accept this offer.
