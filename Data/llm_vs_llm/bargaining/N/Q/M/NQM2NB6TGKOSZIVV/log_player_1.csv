Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 50,""bob_gain"": 50,""message"": ""Let's split it equally for a fair start!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since we're in round 2 and inflation affects your gains by 5%, I'm offering you $45 which is still worth more than the $47.50 value of your previous offer. This is a fair deal considering the inflation factor. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
