"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it equally for a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice offered a 50-50 split, which appears fair at first glance. However, I have an advantage here because inflation affects Alice's gains more than mine (5% vs 0% per round).

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, Alice's potential gain would be worth 5% less to her. This gives me some negotiating leverage to potentially get a better deal.

Given this advantage, I'll reject this first offer to try for a more favorable split in the next round.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice's money loses 5% value each round and we're now in round 2, I can use this to negotiate a slightly better deal for myself while still being reasonable.

Her $50 from round 1 would now be worth $47.50 to her due to 5% inflation. I'll offer her a bit more than that to make it attractive, but take advantage of the inflation factor.
