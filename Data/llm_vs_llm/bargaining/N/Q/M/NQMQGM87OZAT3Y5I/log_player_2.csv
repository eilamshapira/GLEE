"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a quick settlement: I take $30, and you get $70. Since my money devalues by 20% each round, I'd prefer we agree now for a fair and speedy conclusion! 
# Bob gain: 70 
# Alice gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing I get $70 while she takes $30. Since the money doesn't devalue for me in future rounds (0% inflation for me), but devalues 20% for Alice each round, I technically have a stronger negotiating position.

If I reject and propose in the next round, Alice might be more willing to accept a better deal for me since her potential share would be worth less to her. However, $70 is already a favorable split in my direction.
