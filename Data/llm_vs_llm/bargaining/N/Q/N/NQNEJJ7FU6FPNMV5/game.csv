88.89,11.11,"Alice, considering that if you reject you’d have to wait until round 3—with your money being 20% less in value—you’d end up with roughly an effective 80 out of 100. By accepting now, you secure about 88.89 nominal (which is worth 80 effective for you) while I get the rest. I believe this division is the fair outcome given the discounting on your side—please accept it.",Bob,2,
