"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob! Let's make it fair. How about I take $55 and you take $45?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering that if you reject you’d have to wait until round 3—with your money being 20% less in value—you’d end up with roughly an effective 80 out of 100. By accepting now, you secure about 88.89 nominal (which is worth 80 effective for you) while I get the rest. I believe this division is the fair outcome given the discounting on your side—please accept it. 
# Alice gain: 88.89 
# Bob gain: 11.11 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
