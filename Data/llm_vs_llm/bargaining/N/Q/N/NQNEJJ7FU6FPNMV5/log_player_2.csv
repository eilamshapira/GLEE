"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Let's make it fair. How about I take $55 and you take $45? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 11.11, ""alice_gain"": 88.89, ""message"": ""Alice, considering that if you reject you’d have to wait until round 3—with your money being 20% less in value—you’d end up with roughly an effective 80 out of 100. By accepting now, you secure about 88.89 nominal (which is worth 80 effective for you) while I get the rest. I believe this division is the fair outcome given the discounting on your side—please accept it.""}"
