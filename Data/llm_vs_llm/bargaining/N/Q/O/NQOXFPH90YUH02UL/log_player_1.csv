"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think a 60-40 split in my favor is more fair considering that inflation affects you but not me. If we go to another round, your share will be worth even less to you due to the 10% inflation on your side. This offer maximizes our combined utility. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
