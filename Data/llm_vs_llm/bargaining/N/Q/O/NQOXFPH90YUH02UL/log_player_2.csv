"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer gives her $60 and me $40. While I understand she's trying to get more for herself, I need to consider that inflation affects her more than me - her money loses 10% value each round, while mine doesn't lose any value.

If I reject and make a counter-offer, she might be more willing to accept a different split since waiting would cost her. However, I need to be careful not to be too aggressive or she might reject out of principle.

Let me reject this first offer and propose something more favorable to me in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more favorable to me while acknowledging the inflation aspect that affects Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 60, 
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I think a 60-40 split in my favor is more fair considering that inflation affects you but not me. If we go to another round, your share will be worth even less to you due to the 10% inflation on your side. This offer maximizes our combined utility.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems like you're trying to take advantage of the inflation. Let's be reasonable. This offer is still better for you than another round. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has made a slightly better offer for me than her initial one, now offering me $45 instead of $40. She's still trying to get the majority at $55, but she has moved in my direction.

I need to consider that with each round, inflation affects her more (already at 19% loss of value for her), which strengthens my negotiating position. If I reject, she'll lose even more value in the next round due to inflation.

However, continuing to reject could lead to a breakdown in cooperation. The $45 is better than her initial offer, and I'm getting that without any inflation penalty.

I'll accept this offer to conclude the negotiation.
