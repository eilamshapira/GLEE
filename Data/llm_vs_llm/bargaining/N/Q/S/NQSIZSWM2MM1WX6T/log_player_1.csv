"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob for the first round, keeping in mind that inflation will reduce the value by 20% each round for me.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm proposing a fair split that slightly favors me as the first mover. Given that we both face inflation risks by delaying, accepting this now benefits both of us. Let's avoid multiple rounds where we both lose value.""
