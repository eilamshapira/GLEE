I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping to end the game quickly.  Let's see what he thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than the first round. I'll reject it and see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
```

I'm going to try a slightly more even split this time.  I'm willing to give up some of my share, but I still want to get the majority.  Hopefully this will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 360000 
# Bob gain: 640000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly worse for me. I'm still holding out for a better deal.  I'll reject this offer and see what he proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my share again, hoping that Bob will see the value in getting something rather than nothing.  This might be our last chance before the inflation gets too high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 488000 
# Bob gain: 512000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough decision, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of the shrinking value of the money.  I'll accept Bob's offer. It's not ideal, but at least it's something."
