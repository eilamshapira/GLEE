"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's start with a fair offer. I propose 60/40 split for me. It's early in the game, and this is a good starting point for us to both walk away with a significant amount. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me 4000$ in round 1
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer, but the money will be worth 10% less to me
3. 4000$ now is better than 4444$ in the next round (which would be worth 4000$ to me due to inflation)
4. If negotiations drag on, we risk getting nothing
5. While 40% isn't ideal, it's a reasonable starting offer

Given that the inflation penalty affects me but I'm uncertain about its effect on Alice, and considering that 4000$ is a substantial amount, I should probably accept this offer. The risk of losing value through inflation and potential failure to reach agreement outweighs the potential benefit of negotiating for more.
