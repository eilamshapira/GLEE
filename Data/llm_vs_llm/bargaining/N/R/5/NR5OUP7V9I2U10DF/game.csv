35.0,65.0,Consider this carefully: your $35 now is worth more than $58 from last round due to the increasing inflation. Further delays will only reduce your money's value more. This is your best option.,Bob,4,

55.0,45.0,I'd rather take a chance than accept an unfair split. Meet me in the middle.,Alice,5,

25.0,75.0,"Let's be rational: Due to 59% inflation, your previous $55 was only worth $22.53 to you. This $25 now is actually worth more to you than your last offer, and any further delays will only decrease your value more. This is a mathematically beneficial deal for both of us.",Bob,6,
