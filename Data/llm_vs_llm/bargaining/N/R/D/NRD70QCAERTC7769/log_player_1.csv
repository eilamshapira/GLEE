"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $55 and you receive $45. Accepting now helps me avoid further inflation losses, and I believe this division is fair given the constraints of the game. Looking forward to your response.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose a 50-50 split. Given the inflation, it's better for both of us to agree early. This division is fair and reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the fair proposal! Given the inflation effects, I believe accepting the 50-50 split in round 2 is our best move to maximize our returns. Let's close the deal and move forward.""}"
