"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 50/50 split which is the fairest division. Consider that I face 20% inflation per round while you only face 10% - so delaying is more costly for me. This equal split respects both our positions. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation rates and the fact that Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, I think it's a reasonable proposal. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, I should take that into account. 

However, I must calculate the actual value I'd get, taking into account the 10% inflation. The $500,000 I'd get is worth 10% less, so it's actually worth $500,000 * 0.9 = $450,000 to me.

Given this, I think Bob's offer is still a good one, considering the alternative of waiting and risking further devaluation of the money.
