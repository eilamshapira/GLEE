"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40, a fair start 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","While a 60/40 split gives me $400,000, I need to consider the inflation impact. If I reject and make a counter-offer, my money will be worth 20% less next round, while Alice's will only be worth 10% less. This difference in inflation rates puts me at a disadvantage the longer we negotiate.

However, I believe I can propose a more favorable split that accounts for our different inflation rates.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""I propose a 50/50 split which is the fairest division. Consider that I face 20% inflation per round while you only face 10% - so delaying is more costly for me. This equal split respects both our positions.""}"
