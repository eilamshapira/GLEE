60.0,40.0,Let's be fair and avoid further inflation. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
50.0,50.0,"I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50/50 split is the fairest option for both of us. This way we both get an equal share of the money. Since inflation doesn't affect me, I'm comfortable continuing negotiations if needed, but I believe this is a fair compromise.",Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"Bob, I understand you want a 50/50 split, but the value of the money decreases for me with each round. I need to factor that in. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  This is my final offer.",Alice,3,

40.0,60.0,"Alice, I understand your money is losing value with each round due to inflation. Given that reality, I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This is actually fair considering your inflation rate - the 40% you'd receive now is worth more to you than a higher percentage in future rounds would be. I think this is a reasonable compromise given our different circumstances.",Bob,4,
