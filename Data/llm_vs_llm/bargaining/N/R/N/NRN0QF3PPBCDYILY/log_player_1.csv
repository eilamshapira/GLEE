Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50/50 split is the fairest option for both of us. This way we both get an equal share of the money. Since inflation doesn't affect me, I'm comfortable continuing negotiations if needed, but I believe this is a fair compromise.

# Bob gain: 50

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your money is losing value with each round due to inflation. Given that reality, I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This is actually fair considering your inflation rate - the 40% you'd receive now is worth more to you than a higher percentage in future rounds would be. I think this is a reasonable compromise given our different circumstances.

# Bob gain: 60
