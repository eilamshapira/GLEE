"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and avoid further inflation. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing a 60/40 split in her favor, which means I would get $40 and she would get $60.

While a 50/50 split might seem most fair, there are several things to consider:
1. If I reject, I'll make the next offer, but inflation doesn't affect me (0%)
2. I don't know how inflation affects Alice, which is important information
3. Getting $40 now is a guaranteed amount

Since inflation doesn't affect me at all (0%), I could potentially negotiate for a better deal in the next round without losing value. However, without knowing Alice's inflation rate, it's hard to predict if she'll be more willing to compromise in later rounds.

Given that I'm not affected by inflation and could potentially get a better deal, I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me while still being reasonable. Since Alice wanted a 60/40 split in her favor, I'll propose a 50/50 split which is objectively fair.

{""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50/50 split is the fairest option for both of us. This way we both get an equal share of the money. Since inflation doesn't affect me, I'm comfortable continuing negotiations if needed, but I believe this is a fair compromise.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a 50/50 split, but the value of the money decreases for me with each round. I need to factor that in. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer carefully. She's now proposing a 55/45 split in her favor, which means I would get $45 and she would get $55.

Alice has revealed important information: her money is subject to inflation (36% less valuable now than in round 1). This explains why she's eager to reach an agreement. My money, however, maintains its value.

Looking at the situation:
1. Alice has improved her offer from 60/40 to 55/45
2. She's experiencing significant inflation (36% already)
3. She called this her ""final offer""
4. If I reject, I might get a better split in round 4, but Alice's inflation will make her even more desperate

While I could potentially push for an even better deal in the next round, Alice's 55/45 offer is already a significant improvement. Given that she's experiencing such high inflation, if I reject this offer, she might accept an even more favorable split for me in the next round.

However, since I'm not affected by inflation, I have the stronger position. I'll reject this offer to negotiate for a better deal in round 4.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Now I understand Alice's position better. With her experiencing 36% inflation by round 3, she's likely to be even more affected by now. I can leverage this position to get a better deal, but I should still be reasonable enough that she'll accept rather than prolonging negotiations further.

{""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your money is losing value with each round due to inflation. Given that reality, I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This is actually fair considering your inflation rate - the 40% you'd receive now is worth more to you than a higher percentage in future rounds would be. I think this is a reasonable compromise given our different circumstances.""}"
