"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $400,000 while she gets $600,000 out of the $1,000,000 total. If I reject and move to the next round, I'll face 10% inflation on my share, but I'll get to make a counter-offer.

If I reject, the money will be worth 10% less to me, meaning the $1,000,000 pot effectively becomes $900,000 from my perspective. However, I would gain the advantage of making the next proposal.

Given that this is our first round of negotiation and I still have the opportunity to make a counter-offer that might be more favorable to me, I'll reject this initial offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that accounts for the 10% inflation I'm facing while still trying to achieve a fair division.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing an equal split of the money. This is fair and balanced, giving us both the same amount. Since I've already taken a hit from inflation, an equal division now would be reasonable and should be attractive to Alice."
