"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me consider Alice's offer.

She's offering me $40 and keeping $60 for herself. While this isn't an even split, I need to consider the inflation factor. If I reject and we go to another round, the money will be worth 5% less to me. That means if I propose a better split next round, the total value to me would be reduced.

Given that consideration, this isn't a terrible first offer. But I believe I can propose a more favorable split in the next round, even accounting for the 5% inflation penalty.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","For my offer, I'll aim for a more balanced split while acknowledging the inflation factor.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I'm offering an even split of the money. While I've already taken a 5% inflation hit, a fair 50-50 division seems reasonable and should be acceptable to Alice. This gives us both equal shares and allows us to conclude the negotiation without further depreciation of value."
