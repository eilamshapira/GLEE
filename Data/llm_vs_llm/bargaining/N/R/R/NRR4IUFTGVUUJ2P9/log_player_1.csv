"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to propose a split of the $100, keeping in mind the dwindling rounds and the inflation that affects me. I'll start with a proposal that is favorable to me, but hopefully not so outrageous that Bob rejects it outright.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob's offer is a 50/50 split. While my money is worth less this round, a 50/50 split is a reasonable starting point considering the circumstances. I'll accept this to secure at least half the value before further inflation.

""decision"": ""accept""
