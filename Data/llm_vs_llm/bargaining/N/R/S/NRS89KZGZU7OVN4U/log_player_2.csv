"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically.

Alice is offering me $40, keeping $60 for herself. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round. Given that:
1. Alice faces a 20% devaluation per round
2. I face no devaluation
3. We have 11 more rounds if I reject
4. If we fail to agree after 12 rounds, we both get nothing

Since Alice faces significant devaluation and I don't, I have leverage to negotiate for a better deal. Her $60 will be worth only $48 to her in the next round, while my money keeps its full value. This puts pressure on her to accept a more favorable offer for me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that Alice faces 20% devaluation per round and I don't, I can propose a more favorable split for myself. However, I should still make it reasonable enough for her to accept, considering that her $40 would be worth $32 to her in the next round.

{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""explanation"": ""Since you face 20% devaluation each round, this $30 now is worth more than a larger amount in future rounds""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $60, which is a significant improvement from her first offer of $40
2. She's keeping $40 for herself, which due to 36% inflation is only worth $25.60 to her
3. If I reject:
   - I can counter-offer in the next round
   - Alice's inflation will increase to 48%
   - I still face no inflation
   - But we're using up rounds (9 remaining after this)

This is actually a pretty good offer for me. I get a clear majority of the money ($60), and while I could potentially negotiate for more by rejecting, there's a risk of Alice becoming less cooperative as we use up more rounds. The $60 for me is still worth full value, which is quite favorable.
