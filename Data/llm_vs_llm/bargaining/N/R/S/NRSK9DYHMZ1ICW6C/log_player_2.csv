Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  It's a strong offer considering the inflation risk we both face.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's split the money 70/30 in my favor. This is still a fair deal considering the risk of inflation.  Let's end this game and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Even with inflation, Alice's offer is getting worse. I need to push for a better split."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer to the deadline, and I'm still willing to compromise. Let's split the money 65/35 in my favor.  This is a fair deal considering the risk of inflation and our dwindling time. Let's end this game and secure some gains before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is frustrating, but I can't accept an offer this low.  Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation, but I think I can still get a better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  We're halfway through the rounds, and the value of the money is decreasing with each passing moment. I'm proposing a 50/50 split â€“ an even division to end this stalemate. Let's be logical and avoid losing even more money to inflation.""}"
