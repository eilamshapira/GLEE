45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, considering the faster depreciation on your side, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This way, we can settle quickly and you still get a significant share before the value drops further for you.",Bob,2,

58.0,42.0,"Bob, I've lowered my request to 58-42. This is very fair considering my 10% depreciation rate vs your 5%. If we delay further, we both lose more value, but I lose twice as fast as you. Let's make a deal now.",Alice,3,

47.0,53.0,"Alice, given the rapid depreciation on your side, I'm proposing a 53-47 split in my favor. This offer takes into account the urgency to settle before the value diminishes further for you. Let's agree soon to maximize our gains.",Bob,4,
