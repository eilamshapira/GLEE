"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a fair 60-40 split in my favor. Consider that the money loses value faster for me (10%) than for you (5%) each round, so it's in both our interests to agree quickly.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the faster depreciation on your side, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This way, we can settle quickly and you still get a significant share before the value drops further for you. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The depreciation rate is exactly why I should get more, not less. I'll make a better offer in the next round that accounts for our different inflation rates."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58,
""bob_gain"": 42,
""message"": ""Bob, I've lowered my request to 58-42. This is very fair considering my 10% depreciation rate vs your 5%. If we delay further, we both lose more value, but I lose twice as fast as you. Let's make a deal now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, given the rapid depreciation on your side, I'm proposing a 53-47 split in my favor. This offer takes into account the urgency to settle before the value diminishes further for you. Let's agree soon to maximize our gains. 
# Alice gain: 47 
# Bob gain: 53 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

While this isn't ideal, the mounting inflation makes it sensible to accept now. With my 10% depreciation rate, further delays would hurt me more than Bob, and this offer is better than his previous one. It's a reasonable compromise to avoid further value loss."
