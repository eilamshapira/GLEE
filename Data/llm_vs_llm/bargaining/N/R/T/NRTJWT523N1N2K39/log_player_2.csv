"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a fair 60-40 split in my favor. Consider that the money loses value faster for me (10%) than for you (5%) each round, so it's in both our interests to agree quickly.

# Alice gain: 60

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I've lowered my request to 58-42. This is very fair considering my 10% depreciation rate vs your 5%. If we delay further, we both lose more value, but I lose twice as fast as you. Let's make a deal now. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58
