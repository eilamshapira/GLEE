"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I believe a 60-40 split is fair. Let's secure our gains! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, the total amount will be worth $95 in the next round
4. My potential maximum gain in the next round would be less than $95

While 40-60 isn't exactly equal, it's a reasonable offer. If I reject, the 5% inflation penalty means we're already losing value. Making a counter-offer might lead to further negotiations and more value loss.
