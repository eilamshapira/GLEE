"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a strategic first offer, considering that:
1. The money loses value faster for me (10%) than for Bob (5%) each round
2. Bob might reject a very unfair offer, leading to a worse outcome for both
3. I should aim for a favorable but reasonable split

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, as it's assertive but not extremely unfair. If Bob rejects, we'll both lose value in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Due to inflation, if I accept this offer:
   * My $500,000 is actually worth $450,000 (10% less)
   * Bob's $500,000 is worth $475,000 (5% less)

2. If I reject:
   * Next round will have another 10% reduction for me
   * I could offer again, but the total value will be even lower
   * My next offer would be worth even less due to compounding inflation

3. This is actually a fair 50-50 split of the nominal amount, though slightly favoring Bob due to different inflation rates

Given that:
- The offer is reasonably fair
- Rejecting would lead to further value loss for both parties
- The inflation rate is higher for me, so waiting is worse for me
