"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether Alice's offer is fair considering the inflation factors. Alice is offering me $400,000 while taking $600,000.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total money will be worth 5% less to me and 10% less to Alice. This gives me some leverage, since inflation affects Alice more than me.

The current offer gives me $400,000, which is less than half. If I reject, I can propose a more favorable split in the next round, where the total value to Alice is reduced more significantly than for me.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since inflation affects Alice more (10% per round) than me (5% per round), I can use this to negotiate a more balanced split. Given that we're now in round 2 and the next round would reduce Alice's value by another 10%, I'll propose a more equitable division.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing an equal split of the money, which is fair to both of us. If Alice rejects this offer, the money will be worth even less to her in the next round due to the higher inflation rate she faces."
