"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice is offering me $400,000, which is a substantial amount, it's not an equal split of the $1,000,000. Since this is only the first round and I have the opportunity to make a counter-offer, I believe I can negotiate for a better split.

I need to consider the inflation factor (10% per round for me, 5% for Alice), but in the early rounds, there's still room to negotiate without significant value loss.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more equitable offer while acknowledging the inflation pressure we both face.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose an equal split of the money - $500,000 each. This is a fair division that gives us both the same amount. Since we both face inflation with each round (though at different rates), it's in our mutual interest to reach an agreement quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Alice has improved her offer from $400,000 to $450,000 for me. While this is still not an equal split, I need to consider the inflation factors carefully.

If I reject this offer, we'll move to round 4, where my inflation penalty will increase to approximately 27% (from the current 19%), while Alice's will only increase to around 14.3% (from the current 9.75%).

The current offer gives me $450,000, which after the 19% inflation is worth about $364,500. If I wait another round, even a 50-50 split would be worth less to me due to increasing inflation.

Given that Alice has moved significantly toward a more equitable split, and considering the accelerating inflation penalty I face (which is higher than Alice's), accepting this offer now is the prudent decision.
