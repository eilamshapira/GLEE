"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. It's a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
2. However, if I reject, I can make my own offer in the next round
3. The money will be worth 10% less for me if I wait, so my $5000 would effectively become $4500 in the next round
4. There's no guarantee Alice would accept a better offer from me
5. A 50-50 split in the first round is actually quite reasonable

Given this analysis, especially considering the inflation penalty, I'll accept this fair offer rather than risk getting less in future rounds.
