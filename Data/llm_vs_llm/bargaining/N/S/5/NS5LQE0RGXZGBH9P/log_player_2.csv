"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $4000 out of the $10,000, which is 40% of the total. If I reject this offer, I'll have a chance to make my own proposal in the next round, but due to 20% inflation, the total value would only be worth $8000 to me then.

If I reject and propose in the next round, even if I asked for the entire $10,000 (which Alice would likely reject), it would only be worth $8000 to me because of inflation. This means the current offer of $4000 is equivalent to 50% of what the total pot would be worth to me in the next round.

Given the inflation penalty and the reasonable split from Alice, I'll accept this offer.
