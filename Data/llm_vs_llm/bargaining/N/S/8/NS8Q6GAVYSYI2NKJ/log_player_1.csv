"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I need to consider the decreasing value of the money for both of us. Since I'm Alice and it's round 1, I'll start with a slightly advantageous offer, but one that's still reasonable to encourage acceptance.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob rejected my initial offer and now is proposing a split where he gets $5500 and I get $4500. I need to consider the inflation. For me, the money is worth 20% less, and for Bob, it's worth 5% less.

Let's calculate the relative value:

*   My value: $4500 * (1 - 0.20) = $4500 * 0.80 = $3600
*   Bob's value: $5500 * (1 - 0.05) = $5500 * 0.95 = $5225

While Bob's nominal share is higher, the difference in inflation rates makes this offer less appealing to me. However, rejecting means further devaluation in the next round. I need to weigh the potential gains of holding out for a better offer against the guaranteed loss of value. Given that there are only 12 rounds and rejecting leads to further losses, I'll accept this offer.
