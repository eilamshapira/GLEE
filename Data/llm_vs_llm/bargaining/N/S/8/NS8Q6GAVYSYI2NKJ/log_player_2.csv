"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. 

Alice proposes I get $4,500 and she gets $5,500. If I reject this offer, we move to the next round where I can make a counter-proposal, but the total value decreases by 5% for me and 20% for Alice.

In the next round, the $10,000 would be worth $9,500 to me and only $8,000 to Alice. This gives me some leverage since Alice faces a steeper discount rate.

I think I can get a better deal by making a counter-proposal in the next round, so I'll reject this initial offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a strategic offer now. Since Alice faces a steeper inflation penalty (20% vs my 5%), I can leverage this to get a better deal than her initial offer.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I'm proposing that I receive $5,500 and Alice receives $4,500. This reverses Alice's initial proposal. Given that Alice loses 20% value each round compared to my 5%, it should be rational for her to accept this offer rather than prolonging negotiations, as her bargaining position weakens more quickly than mine with each passing round."
