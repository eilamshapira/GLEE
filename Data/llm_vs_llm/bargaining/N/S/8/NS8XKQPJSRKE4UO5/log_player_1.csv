"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can negotiate a bit better. How about a 45/55 split? 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $550,000, but it's worth 20% less than the original value. So, the actual value I'll get is $550,000 * 0.8 = $440,000.

Since this is the first offer I've received, I'll consider it. However, I think I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each round, and 10% less for Bob, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself.

In Round 3, the value of the money for me is 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 of the original value, and for Bob, it's 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 of the original value.

Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 650000, 
""bob_gain"": 350000, 
""message"": ""Let's try a 65/35 split, considering the decreasing value""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet halfway with a 50/50 split. It's the best option considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $500,000, but it's worth 51.2% (1 - 0.488) of the original value. So, the actual value I'll get is $500,000 * 0.512 = $256,000.

A 50/50 split seems fair, and given the significant decrease in value due to inflation, I think it's a reasonable offer.
