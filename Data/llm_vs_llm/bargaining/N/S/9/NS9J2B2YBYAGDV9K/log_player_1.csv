""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that accounts for the 10% inflation penalty I face in future rounds. This gives us both roughly equal effective value - my $550K is worth about the same as your $450K when accounting for the time disadvantage I have. Let's avoid losing value through multiple rounds.""}"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering your time disadvantage and the 10% inflation penalty, I believe this offer is more than fair. The longer we negotiate, the more value you'll lose. I'm willing to end this now with a larger share, but still giving you a substantial amount.

# Bob gain: 600000

If we continue another round, I'll lose another 10% buying power and you'll likely need to offer me even more to compensate. This split acknowledges my time disadvantage while still giving you a substantial amount. Let's conclude this now to maximize our collective value.""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the increasing impact of inflation on your share, I'm willing to make a serious offer to end this now. You've lost nearly 20% of the value already, and another round will only make it worse. This is likely the best deal you'll get, considering the circumstances.

This offer compensates for my significant time disadvantage while still giving you $350,000. If we continue another round, I'll need to ask for even more to offset the mounting inflation penalty. Let's end this now - further delays hurt both our interests.""}"

This offer compensates for that massive disadvantage - my $700K is effectively worth only about $413K in original value. If we continue to the next round, I'll lose nearly half of my value, forcing me to ask for an even larger nominal share. This is a reasonable stopping point that acknowledges the inflation penalty I face. Let's conclude this negotiation now.""}"

My $800K is actually worth less than $383K in original value due to this severe penalty. Your strategy of delaying is clearly intended to exploit the inflation mechanism, but it's resulting in significant collective value loss. This offer reflects the extreme time disadvantage I face. If we continue any further, I would need to ask for nearly the entire amount to receive fair value. Let's end this now with a reasonable division that acknowledges the inflation reality.""}"
