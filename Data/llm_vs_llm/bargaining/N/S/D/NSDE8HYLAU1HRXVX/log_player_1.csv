"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering we both need to reach an agreement quickly to avoid inflation affecting our gains.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is more fair. We both need to reach an agreement soon to avoid inflation, so I'm offering a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is still not favorable enough given I made the first fair offer. The 10% inflation means my $4500 is only worth $4050 now, while Bob's $5500 maintains full value. I'll make a more compelling offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Bob, let's meet in the middle. Due to inflation affecting my gains, this 55-45 split actually means I get less than you in real value. With 20% inflation so far, my $5500 is worth $4400, while your $4500 maintains full value. This is a fair compromise.""}"
