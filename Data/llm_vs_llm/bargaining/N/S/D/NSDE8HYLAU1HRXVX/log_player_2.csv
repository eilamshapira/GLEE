"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's meet in the middle. Due to inflation affecting my gains, this 55-45 split actually means I get less than you in real value. With 20% inflation so far, my $5500 is worth $4400, while your $4500 maintains full value. This is a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
