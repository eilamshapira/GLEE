"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze this offer. I, as Bob, am offered $40. While ideally I'd want more, rejecting the offer means:

1.  The money's value decreases by 5% for me in the next round.
2.  I have to make an offer, which could be seen as more work.
3.  I don't know Alice's inflation rate. If she's also losing value quickly, her next offer might be worse.

Given these factors, $40 isn't a *great* offer, but it's a bird in the hand. Rejecting carries risk, especially since I don't know Alice's inflation rate.
