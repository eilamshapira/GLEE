"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000. While I appreciate her making an offer, a 60-40 split in her favor isn't quite fair when we should be starting from equal negotiating positions. 

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, though I need to consider that the total amount will decrease by 20%. The current total of $10,000 would become $8,000 in the next round.

I think I'll reject this offer and propose something more equitable in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a fair 50-50 split, which is more equitable than Alice's initial offer. Even with the 20% reduction, this would still be better for both of us than accepting the previous uneven split.
