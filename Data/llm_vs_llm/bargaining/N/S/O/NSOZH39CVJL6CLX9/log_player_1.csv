"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair offer to Bob considering our different inflation rates.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm proposing I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. This is a reasonable split considering we both face different inflation rates (I lose 10% per round while Bob loses 20% per round). If we drag this out, we'll both lose value, so I think this fair split benefits us both now."
