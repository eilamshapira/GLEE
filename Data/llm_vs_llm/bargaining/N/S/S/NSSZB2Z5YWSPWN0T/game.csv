3750.0,6250.0,"Since I'm affected by 20% inflation in this round, this split will effectively give me 5000$ after inflation, which is fair. Let's not drag this out and risk losing everything.",Bob,2,

7000.0,3000.0,"Considering the inflation, this split is more than fair for you, don't gamble with the remaining rounds!",Alice,3,

3000.0,7000.0,"With the 48% inflation penalty I'm facing this round, this split will actually give me only about 3640$ in real value, while you get your full 3000$. This is much more balanced than it appears, and we should agree before inflation makes any deal worse for me.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
8500.0,1500.0,"Inflation is heavily favoring me, let's end this before it gets even worse for you!",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"With the current 67% inflation penalty, this 6000$ will only be worth about 2000$ to me, while you get your full 4000$. This is actually a very fair split in real value. Further delays will only make any deal worse for me, and we risk losing everything if we don't agree soon. Please accept this reasonable compromise.",Bob,6,
