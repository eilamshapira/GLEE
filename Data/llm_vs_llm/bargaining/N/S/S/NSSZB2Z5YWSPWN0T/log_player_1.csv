""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, don't risk losing it all!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since I'm affected by 20% inflation in this round, this split will effectively give me 5000$ after inflation, which is fair. Let's not drag this out and risk losing everything. 
# Alice gain: 3750 
# Bob gain: 6250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: With the 48% inflation penalty I'm facing this round, this split will actually give me only about 3640$ in real value, while you get your full 3000$. This is much more balanced than it appears, and we should agree before inflation makes any deal worse for me. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000

""bob_gain"": 1500, 
""message"": ""Inflation is heavily favoring me, let's end this before it gets even worse for you!""}"

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: With the current 67% inflation penalty, this 6000$ will only be worth about 2000$ to me, while you get your full 4000$. This is actually a very fair split in real value. Further delays will only make any deal worse for me, and we risk losing everything if we don't agree soon. Please accept this reasonable compromise.

# Bob gain: 6000
