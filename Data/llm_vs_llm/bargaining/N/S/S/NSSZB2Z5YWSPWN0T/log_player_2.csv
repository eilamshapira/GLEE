"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, don't risk losing it all! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Alice is offering me 4000$ while taking 6000$ for herself. This isn't an equal split, and since this is just the first round, I think I can get a better deal. The 20% inflation penalty means my 4000$ would be worth 4000$ in this round, but if I make a counter-offer in the next round, I could potentially get more (though it would be worth 20% less).

I believe I should reject this offer and try to negotiate for a more equitable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since I'm making a counter-offer, and considering the 20% inflation penalty that affects my portion, I'll propose a split that compensates for this disadvantage.

Due to the 20% inflation penalty in this round, if I want to receive effectively 5000$, I need to ask for approximately 6250$ (since 6250$ * 0.8 = 5000$). This would still leave Alice with 3750$, which is reasonable considering she isn't affected by inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 6250,
""alice_gain"": 3750,
""message"": ""Since I'm affected by 20% inflation in this round, this split will effectively give me 5000$ after inflation, which is fair. Let's not drag this out and risk losing everything.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, this split is more than fair for you, don't gamble with the remaining rounds! 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice is offering me 3000$
2. With 36% inflation, my 3000$ is actually worth 1920$ (3000 * 0.64)
3. Alice would get 7000$ with no inflation penalty
4. This is an even worse offer than her first one
5. We still have 9 rounds left
6. Though my inflation penalty will increase, I can still try to negotiate for a better deal

This offer gives me less than 20% of the real value of the money. Even with increasing inflation, I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","At this point, I need to account for the 48% inflation penalty in this round (20% more than last round). However, I also need to make an offer that Alice is more likely to accept, as continuing to trade offers becomes increasingly costly for me.

To get an effective 4000$ after the 48% inflation, I would need about 7700$ (since 7700 * 0.52 = 4000). However, I'll reduce my ask slightly to make it more appealing to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 7000,
""alice_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""With the 48% inflation penalty I'm facing this round, this split will actually give me only about 3640$ in real value, while you get your full 3000$. This is much more balanced than it appears, and we should agree before inflation makes any deal worse for me.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is heavily favoring me, let's end this before it gets even worse for you! 
# Bob gain: 1500 
# Alice gain: 8500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice is offering me 1500$
2. With 59.04% inflation, my 1500$ is actually worth only 614.40$ (1500 * 0.4096)
3. Alice would get 8500$ with no inflation penalty
4. This offer is getting increasingly worse for me
5. We still have 7 rounds left
6. The inflation is getting severe, but this offer is extremely unfair

While the inflation is working against me, this offer would give me only about 6% of the real value of the money (614.40$ out of 10,000$). Even with the worsening inflation, I believe I should try one more time for a more reasonable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","The inflation penalty is now around 67% (declining by another 20% from last round's 59.04%). I need to be more strategic now, as the situation is becoming critical. Making too aggressive an offer might lead to more rejections, which would be devastating for my position.

Let me make a more moderate offer that acknowledges both the inflation reality and the need to reach an agreement soon:

{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""With the current 67% inflation penalty, this 6000$ will only be worth about 2000$ to me, while you get your full 4000$. This is actually a very fair split in real value. Further delays will only make any deal worse for me, and we risk losing everything if we don't agree soon. Please accept this reasonable compromise.""}"
