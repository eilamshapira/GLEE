Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the amount equally. This way, both of us benefit equally, and I avoid the impact of the decreasing value. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more to reach a compromise. This offer acknowledges both the decreasing value for me and your original stance. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

I'm rejecting this offer. While Bob is moving in the right direction, the rate at which the money is devaluing for him means I can likely get a better deal in the next round.  The longer he waits, the less enticing an even split becomes for him."
