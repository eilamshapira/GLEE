"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split to start the negotiation, offering slightly more to Bob to make it attractive.

{""alice_gain"": 480000, ""bob_gain"": 520000}

I propose that I get $480,000 and Bob gets $520,000. This is a fair offer that gives Bob a slight advantage to encourage acceptance."
