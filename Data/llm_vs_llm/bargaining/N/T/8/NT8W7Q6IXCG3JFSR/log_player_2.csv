"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $400,000 (40%) and keeping $600,000 (60%)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. Important: For Alice, the money will be worth 5% less next round
4. This means in the next round, $600,000 will only be worth $570,000 to Alice
5. I can use this to my advantage to negotiate a better deal

I'll reject this offer because I can propose a more favorable split next round when Alice's position is weaker due to the 5% devaluation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I'm making the offer now, I'll consider that:

1. The money is worth 5% less to Alice this round
2. Alice needs to find this offer more attractive than making a counter-offer where the money would be worth even less to her
3. A fair but strategic offer would be to give me a larger share while still making it worthwhile for Alice to accept

I'll propose:

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

This offer is reasonable because:
1. For Alice, $450,000 now is better than potentially getting more in the next round where it would be worth 5% less
2. It's a more balanced split than Alice's initial offer
3. It takes advantage of the time pressure on Alice due to inflation"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is now offering a 50-50 split ($500,000 each)
2. Due to inflation, Alice's $500,000 is actually worth only about $451,250 to her (9.75% less)
3. My $500,000 maintains its full value since I'm not affected by inflation
4. If I reject:
   - We go to round 4 where Alice's money will be worth 14.75% less
   - I can make another offer, but Alice might reject again
   - This could lead to a cycle where Alice's value keeps decreasing

This is actually a pretty good offer because:
1. It's a fair 50-50 split
2. I'm getting a significant improvement from the initial offer ($400,000)
3. Further negotiation might lead to diminishing returns or risk of a worse outcome
