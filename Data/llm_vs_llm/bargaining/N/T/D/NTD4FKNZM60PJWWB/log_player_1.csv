"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","As Alice, I need to be strategic in this game, considering the 10% inflation penalty I face each round. Bob doesn't face any inflation, so he has less pressure to agree quickly.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose we split the money with me getting $5,500 and Bob getting $4,500. This is a fair offer considering I face 10% inflation each round while Bob doesn't lose any value. If we delay, my share becomes worth less, so I'm offering a balanced division that acknowledges this asymmetry while still being generous to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer as Bob is taking advantage of my inflation penalty. Since I face 10% depreciation each round while he faces none, we should account for this asymmetry in our agreement, not use it to give him an advantage."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}

I propose a slightly more balanced split where I receive $5,200 and Bob receives $4,800. This still accounts for the asymmetry in our situation (I face 10% inflation each round while Bob doesn't), but I'm willing to compromise from my initial position to reach an agreement. This offer is fair considering the time pressure affects me more than Bob, and we both benefit from resolving this sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting this offer because Bob is offering me even less than before, taking advantage of my inflation penalty. His offer would give him 60% of the total, which doesn't fairly account for the asymmetric inflation we face. While I understand we're under time pressure, a more equitable solution is needed."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose a perfectly even 50-50 split of $5,000 each. This is a fair and equitable division despite the fact that I'm facing mounting inflation pressure. I'm willing to meet in the middle to reach an agreement that respects both our interests equally. This balanced proposal demonstrates good faith and should allow us to conclude this negotiation in a way that benefits us both."
