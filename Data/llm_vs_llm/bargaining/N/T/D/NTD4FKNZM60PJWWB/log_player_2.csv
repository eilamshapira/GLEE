"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if this is a fair offer. Alice is offering me $4,500 out of $10,000, which is 45%. While this isn't an even split, I should consider the inflation aspect.

Since money doesn't lose value for me across rounds, but Alice faces 10% inflation per round, I have a strategic advantage in later rounds. If I reject and make a counter-offer, Alice has incentive to accept a better deal for me now rather than waiting.

Based on this assessment, I'll reject this offer and propose a more favorable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Now I'll make a counter-offer that accounts for our different positions regarding inflation. Since money loses 10% value for Alice each round but maintains its value for me, I have more leverage. However, I want to make a reasonable offer that Alice will likely accept.

If Alice rejects my offer now, we'll go to round 3 where the $10,000 is only worth $9,000 to her (due to 10% inflation). I should offer her at least enough that she's better off accepting now than making another offer next round.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering a 55/45 split in my favor, which is reasonable given the inflation pressure Alice faces. This division gives Alice $4,500 now, which is worth more to her than potentially getting a slightly better deal in future rounds when inflation has reduced the money's value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this new offer:

Alice is now offering me $4,800 (48% of the total), which is a $300 improvement from her first offer.

I need to consider that:
1. Alice is facing inflation (19% less value now compared to round 1)
2. If I reject, we move to round 4 where I can make another offer
3. For Alice, further delays mean even more value loss due to inflation

While $4,800 is better than her initial offer, I still have leverage due to the asymmetric inflation. If I make another offer in round 4, Alice will face even more pressure to accept due to the continuing inflation.

Based on this strategic advantage, I'll reject this offer and propose a better split for myself in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since we're now in round 4, Alice's money has lost more value due to inflation (about 27% less valuable than in round 1). This gives me increasing leverage in negotiations.

Alice rejected my previous 55/45 split, but she did improve her offer to me. This suggests she's feeling the pressure of inflation but still wants a decent share. I should make an offer that's more favorable to me than her last offer, while still being reasonable enough for her to accept rather than face further inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor. This gives Alice $4,000 now, which is worth more to her than potentially getting a better deal in future rounds when inflation will have reduced the money's value even further. Given the inflation pressure she's facing, this should be an attractive enough offer to accept rather than prolonging the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to analyze this new offer from Alice:

Alice is now offering a perfectly even 50/50 split ($5,000 each), which is better than her previous offers to me. 

Important considerations:
1. Alice is now facing 34.39% inflation compared to round 1
2. This is a $200 improvement from her last offer
3. If I reject, we go to round 6 where I make another offer, but Alice will face even more inflation
4. We're approaching the halfway point of our 12 rounds

While I could potentially get more by rejecting, Alice's offer of $5,000 is reasonable and fair. There's also increasing risk if we continue negotiating too long - if we reach round 12 without agreement, we both get nothing.

Given that Alice has moved to a fair 50/50 split despite her inflation disadvantage, I'll accept this offer.
