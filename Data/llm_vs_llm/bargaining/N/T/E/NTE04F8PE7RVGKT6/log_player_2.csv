"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

This is a fair 50-50 split, but if I reject it, in the next round I can make a proposal. However, I need to consider that:
1. The money will be worth 10% less for me in the next round
2. Alice only loses 5% value per round
3. Alice could reject my next proposal, leading to further devaluation

With 10% inflation for me, $5000 now is better than potentially getting even $6000 in the next round (which would only be worth $5400 to me due to 10% inflation).

Given these factors, this is actually a good offer since:
- It's fair
- Waiting will definitely cost me more due to higher inflation rate
- There's no guarantee Alice would accept a better offer from me
