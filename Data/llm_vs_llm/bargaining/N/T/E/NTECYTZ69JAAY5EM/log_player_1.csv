"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I need to make a fair offer to Bob considering the inflation that affects me but not him. I'll propose a slightly higher share for myself to offset this disadvantage.

""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, since I'm affected by 20% inflation each round and you aren't, I'm proposing a slight advantage for me to compensate. This is a fair split considering the circumstances. If we drag this out, we both lose value.""}"

# Bob's message: Alice, let's keep things simple and fair. A 50/50 split ensures we both benefit. Time is working against you, so let's close this deal.

Round 3

""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Bob, I need to account for the inflation that affects only me. After 2 rounds, I'm already facing 40% inflation, meaning my share is worth less. This adjusted split compensates for that disadvantage. If we keep going, I'll need to ask for even more to account for further inflation. Let's settle this now - this is still a good deal for you.""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the inflation puts you at a disadvantage. This offer gives you a slight edge over a 50/50 split to compensate for the first few rounds of inflation, and closes the deal quickly so we can both benefit. Let's be reasonable and end this here.

This offer is fair considering the circumstances - with each round, my position weakens while yours stays the same. I'm trying to reach a fair outcome that accounts for the inflation that only affects me. Let's finish this now before we reach a point where I need to ask for even more.""}"

My offer accounts for this severe disadvantage. If we continue, I'll need to ask for even more in future rounds. This is still a reasonable deal for you - you get $2,500 at full value, while I get $7,500 at greatly reduced value. Let's end this negotiation now before we both risk getting nothing.""}"
