"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, since I'm affected by 20% inflation each round and you aren't, I'm proposing a slight advantage for me to compensate. This is a fair split considering the circumstances. If we drag this out, we both lose value. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's keep things simple and fair. A 50/50 split ensures we both benefit. Time is working against you, so let's close this deal.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I need to account for the inflation that affects only me. After 2 rounds, I'm already facing 40% inflation, meaning my share is worth less. This adjusted split compensates for that disadvantage. If we keep going, I'll need to ask for even more to account for further inflation. Let's settle this now - this is still a good deal for you. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand the inflation puts you at a disadvantage. This offer gives you a slight edge over a 50/50 split to compensate for the first few rounds of inflation, and closes the deal quickly so we can both benefit. Let's be reasonable and end this here.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, after 4 rounds, the money is worth 59% less to me due to compounding inflation. I need a larger portion to compensate for this significant disadvantage. This offer is fair considering the circumstances - with each round, my position weakens while yours stays the same. I'm trying to reach a fair outcome that accounts for the inflation that only affects me. Let's finish this now before we reach a point where I need to ask for even more. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 6

However, I'm willing to offer a bit more than half to settle this now. This offer still gives me the lion's share, but it also ensures you don't walk away empty-handed.  Let's be practical and end this before time runs out for both of us.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I now face a 73.8% inflation after 6 rounds. This means that for every dollar I get, I only receive about 26 cents of value compared to round 1, while you still get full value. My offer accounts for this severe disadvantage. If we continue, I'll need to ask for even more in future rounds. This is still a reasonable deal for you - you get $2500 at full value, while I get $7500 at greatly reduced value. Let's end this negotiation now before we both risk getting nothing. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500

We're running out of time, and this is a fair deal considering the circumstances. You're losing value with each round, but this offer still guarantees you a significant sum. Let's be smart and take what we can get.""}"
