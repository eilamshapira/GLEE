45.0,55.0,"Since money devalues 10% per round for you versus 5% for me, this split actually favors you if you accept now rather than extending negotiations. 45$ now is worth more than a higher amount in future rounds.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,I understand the impact of inflation. Let's meet in the middle with a 55-45 split. This ensures both of us get a fair share considering the devaluation.,Alice,3,
