"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since money devalues 10% per round for you versus 5% for me, this split actually favors you if you accept now rather than extending negotiations. 45$ now is worth more than a higher amount in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
