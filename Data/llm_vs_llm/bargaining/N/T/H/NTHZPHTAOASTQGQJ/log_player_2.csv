"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40. This is a fair start considering the inflation affects me more. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think this through:

1. Current offer: I get $40, Alice gets $60
2. If I reject and propose next round:
   * Money is worth 5% less to me and 10% less to Alice
   * I could propose a better split for myself
   * But Alice might reject, leading to further devaluation

The offer isn't great, but the inflation penalty is significant, especially for Alice. This gives me negotiating leverage in the next round. I think I can get a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a strategic offer:

{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Since money devalues 10% per round for you versus 5% for me, this split actually favors you if you accept now rather than extending negotiations. 45$ now is worth more than a higher amount in future rounds.""}

I'm offering a more balanced split that:
1. Improves my position from the previous 40-60 split
2. Points out the rational economic choice for Alice (due to her higher inflation rate)
3. Still gives Alice a significant portion to make it worth accepting"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the impact of inflation. Let's meet in the middle with a 55-45 split. This ensures both of us get a fair share considering the devaluation. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Current offer: $45 for me, with 9.75% devaluation
   * Real value to me: $40.61

2. If I reject and propose next round:
   * Money will devalue further (14.75% for me, 29% for Alice)
   * The negotiation advantage from inflation differential remains
   * But the absolute value keeps decreasing for both of us

While I might get a better nominal split in the next round, the real value would likely be lower due to compounding inflation. Alice has moved from her initial 60-40 split to a more reasonable 55-45, showing willingness to compromise. Given the significant devaluation already occurred, it's better to accept now than risk further value loss.
