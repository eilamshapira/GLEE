"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a counter-offer in the next round, as I believe a more equitable distribution is possible, even considering the 10% inflation penalty."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I propose a fair 50-50 split. This is a reasonable and equitable division that should be acceptable to both parties. Considering the 10% inflation penalty that will apply if this offer is rejected, it would be in both our interests to agree to this fair distribution."
