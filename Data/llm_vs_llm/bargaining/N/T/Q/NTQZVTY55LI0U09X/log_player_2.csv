Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, let's calculate.  The original $10,000 is now worth considerably less to me, considering the inflation across the rounds. It's complex to calculate the exact worth to me without knowing the detailed inflation model for Alice. However, I know my share is worth less with each round.

I'll try to secure a larger share this time, accounting for the devaluation.  Since I'm making the offer, I'll lean in my favor, but offer Alice enough to hopefully entice her to accept.

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, at this point, my share has significantly depreciated.  I need to be more aggressive to make it worthwhile, while also ensuring Alice doesn't see the offer as completely unreasonable.
