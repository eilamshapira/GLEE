"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair starting point. Let's get this done! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Since Alice's money loses 5% value each round and mine doesn't, I have some negotiating leverage. If we go to the next round, her $6000 would only be worth $5700 to her, while my potential share maintains its value.

Starting with a 40-60 split when I have this advantage doesn't seem optimal. I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that I have negotiating leverage due to the 5% depreciation on Alice's side, I'll propose a more favorable split for me, but still reasonable enough that she might accept rather than risk further depreciation.

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Given that waiting reduces the value for you by 5% each round, this is a fair offer that gives you $4500 now rather than a depreciated amount later. Let's conclude this efficiently.""}"
