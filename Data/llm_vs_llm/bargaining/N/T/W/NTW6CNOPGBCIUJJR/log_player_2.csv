"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
- Alice is offering me $4,500 out of $10,000
- If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
- However, the money will be worth 10% less to me next round
- $4,500 now vs ($10,000 * 0.9) = $9,000 to divide next round
- In negotiations, it's often good to make a counter-offer
- 45% is a bit low for an equal split, but not terrible

I'll reject this first offer to try to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer, but considering that money loses value faster for me than for Alice (10% vs 5% per round), I'll aim for a slightly better than 50-50 split to compensate:

{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800}

This offer gives me 52% and Alice 48%, which is fair considering:
1. The money loses value faster for me
2. We both need to reach an agreement soon
3. It's still close to an equal split
4. Alice's first offer was more skewed (55-45 in her favor)"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice offered $4,600, which due to 19% inflation is actually worth $3,726 to me
2. Her previous offer was $4,500, which was worth $4,500 at the time
3. We've lost two rounds, and the inflation is hitting me harder (10% vs 5% per round)
4. If I reject, next round my share will be worth even less (29% less than original)
5. Alice has only moved $100 from her initial offer, showing limited willingness to compromise

Given that:
- The real value I'm being offered is decreasing
- We have a limited number of rounds
- The inflation differential puts me at a disadvantage
- Further negotiations might result in even less real value

I should accept this offer now before inflation erodes more value.
