"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: First offer, slightly favors me, hoping for quick agreement to avoid inflation! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer carefully. She's offering me $45 while taking $55 for herself. It's slightly in her favor, but she makes a valid point about inflation - if we go to another round, the total value decreases by 5%.

If I reject and we go to the next round, we'll be dividing $95 instead of $100, and I'd need to make the next offer. While I could propose a more favorable split for myself, there's risk in prolonging negotiations due to the decreasing total value.

Since the difference is only $10 and further negotiation would reduce our total pot, I'll accept this reasonable first offer.
