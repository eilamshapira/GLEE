"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice is offering me $400,000, which is a substantial amount, I believe we can reach a more equitable division. Since this is just the first round and I don't face any inflation penalty, I can afford to negotiate for a better split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split while still acknowledging Alice's position as the first mover.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I believe a 50-50 split is the fairest approach, giving us each an equal share of $500,000. This is a balanced and equitable division that respects both of our interests."
