"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable first offer that gives both of us a good amount while acknowledging my first-mover position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider that with inflation, my $45 is now worth $42.75 (45 * 0.95). If I reject and we continue to the next round, any future amount will be worth even less due to further inflation. While I could try to negotiate for more, the risk of losing value through inflation makes this offer reasonable enough.
