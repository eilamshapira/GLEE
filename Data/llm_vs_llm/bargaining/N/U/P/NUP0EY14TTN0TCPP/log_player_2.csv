Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's try this again. I'm adjusting my offer considering the inflation and your previous counter. Let's end this now. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is even worse than the first, especially considering the significant inflation for Alice. It seems like she's trying to take advantage of the situation.  I need to hold out for a better deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 475000, ""alice_gain"": 525000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer.  You're clearly impacted by inflation as well, even if you haven't revealed the details.  Let's settle this now before it gets worse for both of us.""}
