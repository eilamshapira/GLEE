"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 3, keeping in mind the potential for further inflation (which I can't fully calculate, but I'll try to be aggressive):

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering that the money Bob gains is worth significantly less than in the first round, and my money is still worth the same, I will evaluate this offer.

Given that my money still worth the same, I think that I should still get more in the current round.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 5, knowing inflation is eroding the value of Bob's share and the possibility of further rounds:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the significant impact of inflation on Bob's share (67.23% less value) and that my share maintains its original value, I need to make a decision. While 60 for me is less than previous offers I made, the value of Bob's 40 is far less than the value of the 40 in the first round. I think I should accept this.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
