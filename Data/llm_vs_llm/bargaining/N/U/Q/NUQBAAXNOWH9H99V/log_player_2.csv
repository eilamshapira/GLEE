"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to think about Alice's offer. She's proposing that she gets $6,000 and I get $4,000. 

Given the inflation rates (10% for me, 5% for Alice), rejecting now means the total value decreases, but I would get to make a counter-offer. If I reject and propose a more favorable split in the next round, Alice might accept it if it's reasonable.

Since this is just the first round and I have the opportunity to make a counter-offer, I'll reject this proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to make a reasonable counter-offer that Alice would be likely to accept, considering our different inflation rates and the fact that rejecting offers reduces the overall value.

Since Alice offered me $4,000 in round 1, I'll propose a more balanced split that favors me slightly, but not so much that Alice would likely reject it.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I'm proposing that I receive $5,500 and Alice receives $4,500. This is a fair division that acknowledges both of our interests in finalizing the deal before inflation reduces our gains too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's new offer. She's now offering me $4,200 (up from $4,000 in round 1) and keeping $5,800 for herself.

With inflation, the real value for me is now reduced by 19%, so $4,200 is worth about $3,402 in original value. If I reject and we continue to later rounds, inflation will further reduce the value.

Alice has moved slightly in my direction from her initial offer. If I reject again, we'll move to round 4 with even higher inflation, and I'd need to make another counter-offer that Alice might reject again.

Given the accelerating inflation penalties and the modest improvement in Alice's offer, I'll accept this proposal to secure a definite gain rather than risk further value reduction through continued negotiation.
