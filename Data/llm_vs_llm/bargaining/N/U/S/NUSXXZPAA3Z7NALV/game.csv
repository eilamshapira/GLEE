737856.0,262144.0,"Hi Bob, here's my proposal for a fair split given our discount structure. If you accept now, you'll receive $262144 and I’ll keep $737856. Waiting only reduces the value of your money by 20% each round, so it’s in your best interest to settle now. I look forward to your acceptance!",Alice,1,

600000.0,400000.0,"Let's aim for a more balanced split. This offer gives you a larger share, but still allows me to receive a substantial amount. Considering the inflation, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement sooner rather than later.",Bob,2,
,,"Thanks for the offer, Bob. Given the current discounting structure where my share isn’t impacted by delay while yours is, I believe I can secure a better outcome by counter-proposing in the next round. I look forward to continuing our negotiation.",Alice,2,reject
999999.0,1.0,"Bob, in round 3 I propose we finalize the deal: I take $999999 nominally and you get $1. While this may appear lopsided, remember that with each round your money loses 20% of its value. If you reject, you'll be the proposer in round 4—but by then your dollars are worth only 40% of their original value, effectively leaving you with almost nothing. Accept this offer now to secure a positive outcome rather than risk a future where nearly all the value is lost.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
700000.0,300000.0,"Alice, considering the decreasing value of the money for me, I'm willing to make a significant concession. This offer gives you a larger share, but still allows me to receive a substantial amount. Let's finalize the deal before the inflation further reduces my potential earnings.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, while your proposal offers me $700000 at full value, I believe I can secure an even more favorable outcome by proposing in the next round. Given that your share is now discounted by 48.8% (meaning your $300000 is effectively worth only about $153600), waiting further will only worsen your position. I’m opting to reject this offer and propose my own terms in round 5, which I trust will benefit me even more. Let's continue negotiating.",Alice,4,reject
200000.0,800000.0,"Bob, in round 5 the effective value for you is significantly eroded by inflation. Right now, your $800000 nominal share would be worth 0.4096 × 800000 ≈ $327680 in today's terms. If you reject and become proposer in round 6, you'll face a further discount, leaving you with an effective value close to that same amount. To avoid further loss, I propose this division now, which is better for you than the continuation value. I urge you to accept this offer before the inflation bites any deeper.",Alice,5,
