"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 737856, ""bob_gain"": 262144, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal for a fair split given our discount structure. If you accept now, you'll receive $262,144 and I’ll keep $737,856. Waiting only reduces the value of your money by 20% each round, so it’s in your best interest to settle now. I look forward to your acceptance!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's aim for a more balanced split. This offer gives you a larger share, but still allows me to receive a substantial amount. Considering the inflation, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. Given the current discounting structure where my share isn’t impacted by delay while yours is, I believe I can secure a better outcome by counter-proposing in the next round. I look forward to continuing our negotiation.""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Bob, in round 3 I propose we finalize the deal: I take $999,999 nominally and you get $1. While this may appear lopsided, remember that with each round your money loses 20% of its value. If you reject, you'll be the proposer in round 4—but by then your dollars are worth only 40% of their original value, effectively leaving you with almost nothing. Accept this offer now to secure a positive outcome rather than risk a future where nearly all the value is lost.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the decreasing value of the money for me, I'm willing to make a significant concession. This offer gives you a larger share, but still allows me to receive a substantial amount. Let's finalize the deal before the inflation further reduces my potential earnings. 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, while your proposal offers me $700,000 at full value, I believe I can secure an even more favorable outcome by proposing in the next round. Given that your share is now discounted by 48.8% (meaning your $300,000 is effectively worth only about $153,600), waiting further will only worsen your position. I’m opting to reject this offer and propose my own terms in round 5, which I trust will benefit me even more. Let's continue negotiating.""}"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 200000, ""bob_gain"": 800000, ""message"": ""Bob, in round 5 the effective value for you is significantly eroded by inflation. Right now, your $800,000 nominal share would be worth 0.4096 × 800,000 ≈ $327,680 in today's terms. If you reject and become proposer in round 6, you'll face a further discount, leaving you with an effective value close to that same amount. To avoid further loss, I propose this division now, which is better for you than the continuation value. I urge you to accept this offer before the inflation bites any deeper.""}"
