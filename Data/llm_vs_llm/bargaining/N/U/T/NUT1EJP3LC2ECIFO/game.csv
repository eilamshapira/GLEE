6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I'd like to propose the following: I take $6000 and you get $4000. Accepting in Round 1 helps us both avoid the complications of inflation (especially since my share loses 20% value in later rounds). I believe a prompt agreement benefits us both. Looking forward to your thoughts.",Alice,1,
