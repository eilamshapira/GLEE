"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'd like to propose the following: I take $6000 and you get $4000. Accepting in Round 1 helps us both avoid the complications of inflation (especially since my share loses 20% value in later rounds). I believe a prompt agreement benefits us both. Looking forward to your thoughts.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your proposal.  I'm sure you understand that your initial offer wasn't quite equitable. How about a 52.5/47.5 split? It's fair and avoids too much loss due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
