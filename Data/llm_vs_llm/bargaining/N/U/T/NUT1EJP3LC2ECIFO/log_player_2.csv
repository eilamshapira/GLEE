"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'd like to propose the following: I take $6000 and you get $4000. Accepting in Round 1 helps us both avoid the complications of inflation (especially since my share loses 20% value in later rounds). I believe a prompt agreement benefits us both. Looking forward to your thoughts. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5250, ""alice_gain"": 4750, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your proposal.  I'm sure you understand that your initial offer wasn't quite equitable. How about a 52.5/47.5 split? It's fair and avoids too much loss due to inflation.""}"
