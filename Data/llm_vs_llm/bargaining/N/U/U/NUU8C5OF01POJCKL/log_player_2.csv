"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly and avoid losing any value to inflation! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split ($50 each)
2. If I reject, the next round will have 5% inflation for me
3. In the next round, I could propose something, but Alice might reject
4. A 50-50 split is generally considered fair
5. The longer we negotiate, the less money I'll get due to inflation

This is actually a reasonable first offer. While I could try to negotiate for more, the risk of losing value to inflation and potential further rejections makes this attractive. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush.
