"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. I will make the first offer.

Here's my proposal in JSON format:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the inflation. My money is worth less, and Bob's offer is now.

Since I rejected his first offer, and now he is giving me 50$, I will accept.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
