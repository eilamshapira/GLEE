"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think a 55-45 split is more reasonable, as we both want to reach an agreement quickly and I'm taking on the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The inflation penalty makes this a reasonable offer. With 5% inflation, my $45 is worth $42.75, which is still better than risking further rounds of negotiation where the value would decrease more. Bob's offer is fair enough considering the circumstances, and reaching an agreement now is better than prolonging negotiations."
