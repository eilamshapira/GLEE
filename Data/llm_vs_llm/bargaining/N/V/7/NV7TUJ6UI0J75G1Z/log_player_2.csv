"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer carefully considering the inflation effect. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000, which is 40% of the total amount. If I reject and move to the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation.

If I reject now, the $10,000 would effectively be worth $8,000 to me in the next round. Even if I proposed a better split for myself in the next round, I need to factor in this 20% loss.

Considering the inflation penalty, I'll accept this offer.
