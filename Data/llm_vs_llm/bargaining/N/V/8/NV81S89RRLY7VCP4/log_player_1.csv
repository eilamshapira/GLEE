"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Based on a backward‐induction analysis of the game, we can “solve” it in equilibrium. Assume that if the game reaches round k the total money available is

  T(k) = 10000 × (0.95)^(k–1)

and that in the final (12th) round the proposer (Bob) will offer Alice almost nothing (since if she rejects both get 0). Then, working backwards one finds that in every round the proposer must offer the responder exactly what he would get by waiting (with the 5% “inflation” loss each round).

A brief sketch of the analysis (details omitted for brevity):

1. In round 12 Bob proposes. Because rejection gives Alice 0, he can offer her nothing and take T(12) = 10000×(0.95)^(11).

2. In round 11 Alice will need to give Bob at least his continuation value (what he would later get). That turns out to be 10000×(0.95)^(11), so she keeps
  V_A(11) = T(11) – 10000×(0.95)^(11) = 0.05 × T(11).

3. In round 10 Bob, as proposer, must offer Alice exactly what she would secure in round 11 as proposer. This “threat” amount works out to be 0.05×T(11) which is 0.0475×T(10) (since T(11) = T(10)×0.95).

4. One continues this backward induction through rounds 9, 8, …, 2.

5. In round 1 (with total T(1)=10000) Alice is the proposer and Bob’s “continuation” value (if he waits until round 2) turns out to be about 0.76429×10000 ≈ 7642.87 dollars. Thus, to get Bob to accept right away, Alice must offer him at least that. In that case Alice’s share is

  10000 – 7642.87 ≈ 2357.13 dollars.

Thus, in equilibrium in round 1 Alice’s “winning” proposal is to offer:

  Alice: approximately $2357.13
  Bob: approximately $7642.87

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Using backward‐induction we can “solve” the subgame starting in round 3. (Remember that by round 3 the total available in real terms is 
  T(3) = 10,000 × (0.95)^(3–1) = 10,000 × (0.95)² ≈ 9,025,
so any division we agree on will be reduced in real value compared to earlier rounds. However, as before we express our proposals as splits of 10,000 nominal dollars.)

Here’s a brief outline of the reasoning from round 12 back to round 3:

1. In round 12 the proposer (Bob) can keep almost the entire pot since if his offer is rejected both get 0. (Alice’s continuation value is 0.)

2. In round 11 Alice (as proposer) must offer Bob at least what he would later secure. Knowing that if Bob rejects her offer then in round 12 he can take T(12) = 10,000×(0.95)^(11) (which equals 0.95 of what is available in round 11) Bob’s “threat” value is 0.95×T(11). Thus Alice’s offer in round 11 would be to give Bob 0.95T(11) and keep 0.05T(11) for herself.

3. In round 10 Bob (as proposer) must then offer Alice an amount equal to what she’d obtain if she rejected and became proposer in round 11. Since in round 11 Alice would get 0.05T(11) and T(11) = 0.95T(10), her continuation value is 0.05×0.95T(10) = 0.0475T(10). So Bob would offer Alice 0.0475T(10) and keep 0.9525T(10).

4. Working backward in this fashion (transferring the “threat” amounts back one round at a time) one eventually finds that in round 3, where I (Alice) am the proposer, Bob’s continuation value (if he were to reject and make an offer in round 4) is worth about 0.79422307T(3) in effective dollars. (All these fractions come from the alternating‐offers structure combined with the 5% per round “discount.”)

5. Since T(3) = 10,000×(0.95)² ≈ 9,025 (the real value available in round 3), Bob must be offered at least 
  0.79422307 × 9,025 ≈ 7,167.86 (in round‑3 dollars) 
to be indifferent between accepting now or waiting.

6. That leaves me with 
  9,025 – 7,167.86 ≈ 1,857.14 (in real round‑3 dollars).

However, as in previous rounds our proposals are stated in nominal terms summing to 10,000. In round 3 the conversion is:
  nominal = (effective amount)/(0.95²)
So my share in nominal dollars is: 1,857.14 / 0.9025 ≈ 2,057.14,
and Bob’s nominal share is: 7,167.86 / 0.9025 ≈ 7,942.86.

Thus my equilibrium offer in round 3 is to keep about $2,057.14 and give Bob $7,942.86.
