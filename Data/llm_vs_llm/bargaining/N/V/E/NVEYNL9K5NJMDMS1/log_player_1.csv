"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly and end the game quickly to avoid losing value""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe my contribution to our success warrants a larger share. Let's be reasonable and avoid further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $4000, which is worth 5% less than its original value, so I'll effectively get 4000 * 0.95 = $3800.

If I reject the offer, the money will be worth even less in the next round. For me, it will be worth 5% less again, and for Bob, it will be worth 20% less again.

Given the significant devaluation for Bob in each round, I think I can get a better deal if I wait. So, I'll reject Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me in each round, and 20% less for Bob, I'll try to take advantage of this.

In Round 3, the effective value of the money for me is 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025 (5% less in each of the two previous rounds), and for Bob, it's 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 (20% less in each of the two previous rounds).

Considering this, I'll make an offer that's slightly more favorable to myself:

{""alice_gain"": 6500, 
""bob_gain"": 3500, 
""message"": ""Let's end the game before the money loses more value, especially for you""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This offer reflects the increasing pressure of inflation on my share. I'm willing to settle, but it needs to be fair considering the devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $4500, which is worth 14.26% less than its original value, so I'll effectively get 4500 * 0.8574 = $3856.7.

If I reject the offer, the money will be worth even less in the next round. For me, it will be worth 5% less again, and for Bob, it will be worth 20% less again.

Given the significant devaluation for Bob, I think he's getting desperate, and I might be able to get a better deal if I wait. However, I also need to consider that the devaluation is affecting me, and waiting too long might not be beneficial.

In this case, I think Bob's offer is not too bad, considering the devaluation. I'll accept it to avoid further losses.
