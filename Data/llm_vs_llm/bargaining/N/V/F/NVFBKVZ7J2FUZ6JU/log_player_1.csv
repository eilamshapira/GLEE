"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make my first offer to Bob, considering the fact that inflation affects both of us differently.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I suggest we split the money 60/40. Since inflation affects me more severely (20% per round vs your 10%), it's reasonable that I get a slightly larger portion now. This way we both benefit from concluding the deal quickly rather than letting inflation erode the value."
