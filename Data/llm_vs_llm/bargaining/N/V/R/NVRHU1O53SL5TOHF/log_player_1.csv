"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer as Alice in this game.

Given that inflation affects me more than Bob (20% versus 10% per round), I should consider making a fair initial offer that Bob is likely to accept. If we go to the next round, the total value will decrease for both of us, but more significantly for me.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering a slightly higher amount for myself but still close to an even split. This acknowledges that we both benefit from reaching an agreement in the first round, especially since inflation will reduce the value of the money more significantly for me than for Bob if we delay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer for an equal split. Since inflation affects me more severely (20% vs Bob's 10% per round), it's in my best interest to agree now rather than risk further devaluation. If we went to another round, my share would be worth even less, so this 50-50 split is reasonable given the circumstances."
