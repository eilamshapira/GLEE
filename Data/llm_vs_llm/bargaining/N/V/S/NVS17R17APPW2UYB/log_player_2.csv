"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer gives me $4,000 while she takes $6,000. If I reject and we go to the next round, the total value decreases by 5% for me and 20% for Alice.

Let me evaluate:
- If I accept now: I get $4,000
- If I reject: I can make a counter-offer next round with the $10,000 being worth $9,500 to me and only $8,000 to Alice

Since I can make a better proposal in the next round due to the asymmetric inflation penalty, I should reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll now make a counter-offer for round 2.

The money is now worth 5% less to me and 20% less to Alice. This means Alice is more pressured to accept a deal, as further delays hurt her more than they hurt me.

I should offer a split that's fair enough for Alice to accept while maximizing my gain. Given the asymmetric inflation penalties, I'll propose a more balanced split that still favors me slightly.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice rejected my previous offer and is now offering me $4,200 while she takes $5,800.

Let me analyze the current situation:
- Due to inflation, the money is now worth 9.75% less to me than in round 1
- For Alice, it's worth 36% less than in round 1
- If I accept now: I get $4,200, which is worth approximately $3,790 in round 1 value for me
- If I reject: In the next round, the inflation penalty gets worse for both of us, but much worse for Alice (she loses 20% more value each round)

Alice has improved her offer to me from $4,000 to $4,200, which shows she's feeling the pressure of the asymmetric inflation. However, since inflation affects her much more severely, I can probably get a better deal by rejecting and making another offer in round 4.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll make a new proposal. At this point, the inflation penalty is substantially affecting Alice (36% loss already), while affecting me less (9.75% loss).

Given that each additional round costs Alice much more than it costs me, I have increased leverage. If we go to round 5, Alice would face about 49% inflation compared to my 14.26% inflation.

I'll propose a split that's more favorable to me while still being reasonable enough that Alice should accept it rather than face another 20% reduction in value.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice rejected my offer and is now offering me $4,400 while she takes $5,600.

Current inflation effects:
- For me: 18.55% reduction from original value
- For Alice: 59.04% reduction from original value

If I accept now:
- I get $4,400, which is worth about $3,584 in round 1 value to me (after 18.55% inflation)

If I reject:
- In round 6, I'd face 23.55% inflation while Alice would face 67.2% inflation
- Alice's $5,600 would only be worth about $2,296 in round 1 value to her (after 59.04% inflation)

Alice has increased her offer to me again (from $4,200 to $4,400), showing she's feeling significant pressure from the higher inflation rate she faces. However, she's still asking for $5,600, which is rapidly losing value for her.

Given the severe asymmetric inflation penalty and the fact that Alice's value is decreasing much faster than mine, I should reject and make another offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","At this point, the asymmetric inflation is significantly impacting our negotiation positions. After 5 rounds:

- I've lost 18.55% value (and will lose 23.55% after this round)
- Alice has lost 59.04% value (and will lose 67.2% after this round)

Alice keeps rejecting my offers but is gradually increasing what she's willing to give me. The inflation penalty is much more severe for her, so she should be highly motivated to reach an agreement.

Given the extreme inflation pressure on Alice, I'll make an offer that's reasonably fair but still advantages me. If Alice rejects again, her portion will lose substantial value in the next round.
