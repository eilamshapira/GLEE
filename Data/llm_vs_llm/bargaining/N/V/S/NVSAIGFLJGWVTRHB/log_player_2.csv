"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to avoid inflation eating into our gains. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer is $40 for me
2. If I reject and move to next round:
   - The total amount will effectively be worth 5% less to me
   - Maximum I could propose would be 95$ (worth $95 Ã— 0.95 = $90.25 to me)
   - Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation

While I could try to negotiate for more, the risk of losing value through inflation and potential further rejections makes the current offer relatively reasonable. $40 now is better than the risk of getting less in future rounds due to inflation.
