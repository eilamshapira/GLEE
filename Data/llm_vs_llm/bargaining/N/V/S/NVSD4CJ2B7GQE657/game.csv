600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob! Let's make this a quick and fair deal. I'll take $600000, and you'll get $400000. This way, we both benefit without having to worry about inflation. What do you say?",Alice,1,

500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Alice, I understand you wanted a quick deal, but your initial split wasn't entirely fair. Since I face a 20% inflation penalty per round and you don't, a 50-50 split is more equitable. This way we both get $500000 and can conclude our business without further devaluation. This is fair for both of us.",Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I understand where you're coming from and want to be fair given your inflation situation. How about $550000 for me and $450000 for you? This way, you get a bit more than what I initially offered, and we both avoid further loss from inflation. Let's wrap this up efficiently!",Alice,3,
