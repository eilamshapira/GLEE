"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you wanted a quick deal, but your initial split wasn't entirely fair. Since I face a 20% inflation penalty per round and you don't, a 50-50 split is more equitable. This way we both get $500000 and can conclude our business without further devaluation. This is fair for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
