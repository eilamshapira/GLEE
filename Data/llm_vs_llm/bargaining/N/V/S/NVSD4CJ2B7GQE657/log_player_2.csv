"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Let's make this a quick and fair deal. I'll take $600000, and you'll get $400000. This way, we both benefit without having to worry about inflation. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $400,000 while she gets $600,000. 

If I reject and we go to the next round, I'll be making the offer, but the money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation. That means the $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $800,000 to me in the next round.

Since I can get $400,000 now, and the entire pot would only be worth $800,000 to me next round, rejecting might not be advantageous unless I believe I can secure significantly more than half in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a fair counteroffer that accounts for the inflation penalty I face.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand you wanted a quick deal, but your initial split wasn't entirely fair. Since I face a 20% inflation penalty per round and you don't, a 50-50 split is more equitable. This way we both get $500,000 and can conclude our business without further devaluation. This is fair for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand where you're coming from and want to be fair given your inflation situation. How about $550000 for me and $450000 for you? This way, you get a bit more than what I initially offered, and we both avoid further loss from inflation. Let's wrap this up efficiently! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate this new offer.

Alice is now offering me $450,000 while she takes $550,000. Due to inflation, the money is worth 36% less to me than in round 1, but not to Alice.

If I reject, we'll go to round 4 where I can make an offer, but the money will be worth 48.8% less to me (1 - 0.8^3). That means the $1,000,000 pot would effectively be worth only $512,000 to me in the next round.

Since I'm being offered $450,000 now, and I'd need to secure substantially more than half the pot in the next round to beat this offer (with significant inflation working against me), accepting Alice's offer is the rational choice.
