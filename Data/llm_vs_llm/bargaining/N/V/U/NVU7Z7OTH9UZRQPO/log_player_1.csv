"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair offer to Bob, considering that he experiences inflation and I don't.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest a slightly favorable split for me, but still quite fair. Since Bob faces 5% inflation per round, it's in his interest to reach an agreement soon rather than waiting for later rounds. This offer gives him a substantial portion while acknowledging my advantage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll adjust my offer to be more enticing to Bob while still recognizing my stronger position.

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}

I'm increasing Bob's share compared to my first offer. Since he faces 5% inflation each round, this offer is worth more to him now than waiting for later rounds. Let's try to reach an agreement that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 43 
# Bob gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll adjust my offer to be more reasonable while still recognizing my position.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing an equal split of the money. This is a fair compromise given that we're now in round 5 and Bob is experiencing increasing inflation. With each round, Bob's share becomes less valuable to him, so this equal division should be appealing now rather than continuing further negotiations."
