"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and end this quickly 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Alice's offer where I get $40 and she gets $60. While not an even split, it's a reasonable offer. Since there's no inflation for me, I don't lose value by continuing, but there's a risk of getting nothing if we reach round 12 without agreement. I think I can get a more favorable split by making a counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""I propose a perfectly equal split of $50 each. This is fair for both of us, and we can finish the game now without risk.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice Alice has slightly improved her offer from $40 to $42 for me. I also learned that she's experiencing inflation (19% already), which explains why she might want to conclude sooner. While my counter-offer of an even split was rejected, I'm thinking strategically about whether to accept or continue negotiating for a better deal.

Given her inflation pressure and the small improvement in her offer, I'll reject once more to see if I can secure a better split.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 48, 
""alice_gain"": 52, 
""message"": ""Let's meet closer to the middle. I'm offering you $52 which is still more than half, but more fair to me than previous offers. With your inflation increasing, it makes sense to conclude soon.""}"
