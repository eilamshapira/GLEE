"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: First offer, a generous 100k for you Bob. Let's not waste time with inflation! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $100,000 out of $1,000,000 (10% of the total)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 20% less to me
3. The current $100,000 offer is better than getting a larger share of a 20% depreciated pot
4. However, 10% is quite low considering the total amount
5. Since this is the first round and we have 11 more rounds, I can afford to negotiate for a better deal

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer while acknowledging the time pressure:

{""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was too uneven. I propose a more balanced split where you still get the larger share. Let's be fair and avoid losing value to inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concern for fairness. I've adjusted the offer to 700k for me and 300k for you. This is my best offer considering the inflation we are both facing. Let's close the deal now. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is now offering $300,000 (30% of the total)
2. Due to 36% inflation for me, this $300,000 is actually worth $192,000 in round 1 terms
3. If I reject, the next round will have even more inflation (losing another 20%)
4. Alice has significantly improved her offer from the initial $100,000
5. While I might want more, the inflation is eating away at the value quickly
6. Getting $192,000 in real value now is better than risking further depreciation
