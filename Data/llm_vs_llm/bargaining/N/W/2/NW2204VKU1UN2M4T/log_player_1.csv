"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 900000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle for a fair deal. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

While Bob's offer sounds ""fair"" on the surface, the impact of inflation means this is heavily skewed in his favor. I'm better off holding out for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 750000,
""bob_gain"": 250000,
""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Bob. This is a fair deal considering the circumstances."" 
}
```

Reasoning:

* **Time Pressure:**  Bob's money is devaluating rapidly.  He needs to make a deal soon.
* **Show Flexibility:**  I've moved significantly from my initial offer, demonstrating willingness to negotiate.
* **Still Favors Me:** This offer still gives me the lion's share, reflecting the reality that time is on my side."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
```

This is a tough one. Bob is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation and is moving closer to my range.  However, I believe his devaluation is significant enough that I can push for a slightly better deal in the next round. It's a gamble, but one I'm willing to take."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

Reasoning:

* **Finality:** Bob needs to understand this is my last concession.  Any further delay significantly hurts him.
* **Slight Improvement:**  I'm offering slightly more than he proposed in Round 4, but less than Round 3.  This signals it's truly my best and final offer.
* **His Loss is My Gain:** By now, Bob has likely internalized that every round costs him significantly. This offer, while favoring me, might be the best he can get at this point."
