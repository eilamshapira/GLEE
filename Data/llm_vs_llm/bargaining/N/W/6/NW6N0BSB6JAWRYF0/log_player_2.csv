"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share, let's be friends 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""My turn. This offer is more balanced considering future rounds.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle, considering inflation 
# Bob gain: 42.5 
# Alice gain: 57.5 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

While not ideal, accepting this offer in round 3 is better than risking a worse offer from Alice in round 4, especially given the impact of inflation on her gains."
