"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest an equal split of the money. Fair and simple, let's both walk away with $50 each. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair offer. Since we're in the first round, there's no inflation yet, so I would get $50. If I reject and we continue to more rounds, inflation will start reducing the total value, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal.
