"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a strategic first offer, considering that Bob's money loses 10% value each round while mine doesn't lose value.

{""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I'm offering you a fair $400,000. Consider that if you reject, your share will be worth 10% less next round. Let's make a deal now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the impact of inflation on me, so I'm offering you $450000. If you reject, I'll have to consider the decreasing value of the money in my future offers. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. If I reject, we go to round 3 where:
   - I can make a new offer
   - Bob's money will be worth another 10% less
   - My money maintains its value
   - This gives me more negotiating power

2. Bob's current offer of $450,000 to me is less than what I initially proposed for myself ($600,000)

3. Given that inflation only affects Bob's share, my negotiating position gets stronger each round, while Bob's gets weaker.

4. I can likely get a better deal by rejecting and making a new offer in round 3, when Bob will be under more pressure due to the increasing impact of inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's share is now affected by 20% inflation (10% more than last round), I'll adjust my offer accordingly while maintaining a strong position.

{""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Bob, consider that your share is now worth 20% less due to inflation. This $350,000 offer now is better than a larger number later when it will be worth even less to you. Let's conclude this deal.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it equally. Considering inflation, this is a fair deal for both of us at this point. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Bob is offering me $500,000, but for his $500,000 share:
   - It's actually worth only about $364,500 to him (due to 27.1% inflation)
   - If we continue to the next round, his share will be worth even less

2. My previous offer was $650,000 for me, and I can likely get closer to that by:
   - Rejecting this offer
   - Making a new offer in round 5
   - Using the increased inflation pressure (it will be ~34% next round)

3. Since my money maintains its full value while Bob's continues to decrease, my negotiating position continues to strengthen.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With Bob's share now affected by about 34% inflation, I'll make a firm offer that acknowledges this reality.

{""alice_gain"": 700000,
""bob_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Bob, due to the 34% inflation on your share, this $300,000 now is actually worth much more than a larger amount in future rounds. This is your best opportunity to maximize your real value. Let's conclude this now.""}"
