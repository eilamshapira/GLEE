"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a fair 50-50 split. This gives us both equal shares of the money. Since there's no inflation penalty for me, I don't need to rush to accept an uneven division, but I'm offering an equal split out of fairness. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
