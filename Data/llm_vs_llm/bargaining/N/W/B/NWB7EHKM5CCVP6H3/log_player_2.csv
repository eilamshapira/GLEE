"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the money with me getting $60 and you getting $40. This seems fair considering the inflation risk for me. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $40 out of $100, which means she would get $60. While this isn't an even split, I don't face any inflation risk (the money is worth 0% less for me with each passing round), so there's no urgency for me to accept an uneven division.

Since I don't lose value by waiting and can make my own proposal in the next round, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. This gives us both equal shares of the money. Since there's no inflation penalty for me, I don't need to rush to accept an uneven division, but I'm offering an equal split out of fairness.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it with me getting $55 and you getting $45. Considering the inflation, this is a reasonable offer for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this new offer. Alice is now offering me $45 out of $100, which is better than her initial offer of $40. I notice that inflation is affecting Alice (her money is now worth 36% less than in round 1), but it doesn't affect me at all.

Since I don't face any inflation penalty, I could reject and make another offer in the next round. However, Alice has moved closer to a fair split, and continuing to negotiate might lead to a more adversarial interaction.

Let me accept this improved offer to conclude the negotiation.
