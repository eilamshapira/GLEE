"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer to Bob, considering that inflation affects my gains by 5% each round, whereas Bob doesn't experience inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose a 55/45 split in our favor. This is a fair division that gives us both a substantial portion, and given that inflation will affect my share in future rounds, it makes sense to reach an agreement early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I see that Bob made an extremely unfair offer. Let me propose a more reasonable division.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose a perfectly equal 50/50 split. This is fair to both of us, and given that inflation affects my gains with each round, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon rather than drag this out further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","I see that Bob is taking an uncooperative approach by repeatedly offering me nothing. Let me try a different strategy.

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60}

I'm proposing a 40/60 split in Bob's favor. This recognizes that with inflation affecting my gains, and considering we've already gone through several rounds, I'm willing to accept a smaller portion to reach an agreement. This is a genuine compromise that benefits us both rather than continuing with offers that lead nowhere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","I see that Bob continues to be uncooperative, but I'll keep trying to reach a reasonable agreement.

{""alice_gain"": 30, ""bob_gain"": 70}

I propose a 30/70 split significantly favoring Bob. At this point, with inflation reducing my gains by nearly a quarter compared to the beginning, I'm willing to accept a smaller portion to reach an agreement. This is a substantial concession from my side and gives Bob a very advantageous deal while still allowing me to receive something meaningful."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","I see that Bob has slightly modified his offer, but it's still extremely unbalanced. Let me continue trying to reach a reasonable agreement.

{""alice_gain"": 20, ""bob_gain"": 80}

I propose a 20/80 split greatly favoring Bob. I'm making a significant concession here, acknowledging that with inflation reducing my gains by over 30% compared to the beginning, and with limited rounds remaining, it's better to reach an agreement soon. This offer gives Bob a very favorable deal while still providing me with a meaningful portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","With only two rounds left and Bob continuing to make extremely unfair offers, I need to adjust my approach.

{""alice_gain"": 10, ""bob_gain"": 90}

I propose a 10/90 split that gives Bob almost everything. With inflation reducing my gains by nearly 40% compared to the beginning and only one round remaining after this, I'm making a last attempt at a reasonable compromise. This offer gives Bob 90% of the money while leaving me with a small portion, which is better than both of us getting nothing if we can't reach an agreement in the final round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 43.12% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
