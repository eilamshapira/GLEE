"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a fair 50-50 split of the money. Since the value decreases by 20% each round, if I reject and make a counter-offer next round, we'd only be dividing $8,000 total. Even if I could get a larger percentage in the next round, the absolute value would likely be less than $5,000.
