"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split, 50$ each. It's the most equitable division and benefits us both equally. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's offer carefully.

Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which is $50 for each of us. This is a perfectly fair division that gives us equal shares of the total amount.

Given that this is a completely equitable proposal right from the first round, and we both would benefit equally, I see no reason to reject it.
