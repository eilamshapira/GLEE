"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice is offering me $400,000 out of $1,000,000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 10% inflation, any amount I get next round will be worth 10% less to me
4. If I reject, $400,000 now would be equivalent to needing $444,444 next round to break even
5. Given the high inflation rate and risk of getting nothing after 12 rounds, $400,000 is a decent first offer
