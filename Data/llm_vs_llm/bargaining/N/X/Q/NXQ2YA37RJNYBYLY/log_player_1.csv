"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. Here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to calculate the value of the money for me in this round, considering inflation.

In round 1, $10,000 was worth $10,000. Now, in round 2, with 10% inflation for me, the $5,000 offered is worth:

$5000 * (1 - 0.10) = $4500 (in terms of round 1 value)

I have to make a decision.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's my turn to make an offer again. I have to consider that the value of the money has decreased for me due to inflation.

In the first round I proposed to get 6000$. Considering that each round the money has 10% less of its value, the actual value of the money is 8000$.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6400,
  ""bob_gain"": 3600
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's calculate the value of the money for me in this round, considering the accumulated inflation.

The money I gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
So in the first round, 10000$ was worth 10000$.
Now in the fourth round 5500$ is worth: 5500 * (1 - 0.271) = $4009.5

I have to make a decision.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's my turn to make an offer again. I need to calculate the value of money I am going to get.

In the first round I proposed to get 6000$. Considering that each round the money has 10% less of its value, and there has been 4 rounds, the actual value of the money is 6561.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's calculate the value of the money for me in this round, considering the accumulated inflation.

The money I gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
So in the first round, 10000$ was worth 10000$.
Now in the sixth round 6000$ is worth: 6000 * (1 - 0.4095) = $3543

I have to make a decision.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's my turn to make an offer again. I have to consider the inflation.

With each round, the money loses 10% of its value for me.
In round 1, I offered myself 6000$. With 6 rounds passed, the money has lost 48.6% of its value for me. The money that I gain now is worth 5140.8$ if I ask for 6000$.
I'm going to offer myself a bit more, knowing the money's value is less, to get a better deal.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6800,
  ""bob_gain"": 3200
}
```"
