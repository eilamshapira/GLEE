"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $400,000 while she gets $600,000 of the $1,000,000. This is a 40/60 split.

While this isn't an even split, it's a substantial amount of money. Since there's no inflation for me (0% impact per round), there's no financial penalty for me to reject and counter-offer in the next round. However, we do have a limited number of rounds total (12), and if we don't reach an agreement, we both get nothing.

I think I can propose a more equitable split in the next round, so I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more equitable split that's still somewhat favorable to Alice while being fairer to me.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split of the $1,000,000, which gives each of us $500,000. This is a fair division that should appeal to Alice's sense of fairness. Since there's no inflation factor affecting me, and I don't know how inflation might affect Alice, an equal split seems reasonable and should be acceptable to both parties."
