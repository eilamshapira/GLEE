"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Let's split it 90/10. Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $100,000, which is 10% of the total
2. If I reject, we go to the next round where:
   - I can make a counter-offer
   - But my money will be worth 10% less
   - $100,000 now is better than $111,111 in the next round (due to 10% inflation)
   - I don't know how inflation affects Alice, which adds uncertainty

3. While 10% might seem low, given the inflation penalty and uncertainty, getting $100,000 now might be better than risking a negotiation where my purchasing power decreases.
