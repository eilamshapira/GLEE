Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's ensure we both walk away with a fair amount. Given my experience, I'm suggesting $60 for me and $40 for you. This way, we both benefit, and can avoid the effects of inflation as the rounds progress.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer was a bit too skewed in your favor. Let's find a middle ground. I propose a 55/45 split, which is fairer and still allows us to avoid significant losses from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
