"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's ensure we both walk away with a fair amount. Given my experience, I'm suggesting $60 for me and $40 for you. This way, we both benefit, and can avoid the effects of inflation as the rounds progress. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer was a bit too skewed in your favor. Let's find a middle ground. I propose a 55/45 split, which is fairer and still allows us to avoid significant losses from inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, let's go for an even split this time. With $50 each, we both walk away fairly and minimize any further effects of inflation. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
