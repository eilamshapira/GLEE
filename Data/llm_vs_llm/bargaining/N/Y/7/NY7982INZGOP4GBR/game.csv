60.0,40.0,Let's split this fairly. I'm offering you 40$ which is a good deal considering I made the first move.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"Let's be reasonable, Alice. I'm offering you $40, which is fair given the time constraint. You get to keep $40, and we both walk away with something. Take it, or we risk losing everything.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
65.0,35.0,"Bob, since the money is worth less to me each round due to inflation, I need a larger share to get the same value. This offer of $65 for me and $35 for you is actually worth less to me than my first offer, but gives you a decent amount. Let's not waste more time.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
35.0,65.0,"Alice, let's stop playing games. I understand the inflation is hurting you, but I also value my time. I'm offering you $35. It's more than you offered me, and it's still a significant amount. Take it and let's move on.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
75.0,25.0,"Bob, due to the 30% inflation effect, I need $75 now to get the same value as $52.50 in round 1. This is a fair offer considering the inflation only affects me. If we keep going, I'll need to ask for even more to compensate for the increasing inflation. Let's conclude this now.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
30.0,70.0,"Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering you $30. It's a fair compromise considering the circumstances. My patience is wearing thin. Accept this and let's be done.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
85.0,15.0,"Bob, with the current 45% inflation, I need $85 just to get the equivalent value of $47 in round 1. Your last offer would have given me only $17.70 in real value. This offer is actually fair when accounting for inflation. If you reject this, we'll both lose more in the next rounds.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
25.0,75.0,"Alice, I'm offering you $25. Look, I understand the inflation is eating into your potential gains, but I need to get something out of this too. This is my best and final offer. If you reject this, I'm not sure we can reach an agreement.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
90.0,10.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. With 56% inflation now, even $90 for me is only worth about $39.60 in real value - less than my first offer! Your last offer of $25 would have given me only $11.95 in real value while you get $75 at full value. We have only 3 rounds left - if we don't agree soon, we both get nothing. This is actually a fair split considering the circumstances.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
20.0,80.0,"Alice, we're almost out of time. I'm offering you $20. It's not ideal for either of us, but it's better than nothing. Consider this a last-ditch effort to salvage something from this negotiation. Take it, and we can both move on.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
95.0,5.0,"Bob, this is our second-to-last chance. With 65% inflation, even $95 only gives me about $33.25 in real value. Your last offer of $20 would have given me just $7.75 in real value while you got $80. If you reject this, we'll have only one round left, and we'll both risk getting nothing. $5 for you is better than zero - let's end this now.",Alice,11,
