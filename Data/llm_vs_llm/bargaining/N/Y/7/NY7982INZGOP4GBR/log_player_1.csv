"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, Alice. I'm offering you $40, which is fair given the time constraint. You get to keep $40, and we both walk away with something. Take it, or we risk losing everything. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The money is worth less to me now due to inflation, and Bob's offer gives him more than he was willing to accept from me. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 65, 
""bob_gain"": 35, 
""message"": ""Bob, since the money is worth less to me each round due to inflation, I need a larger share to get the same value. This offer of $65 for me and $35 for you is actually worth less to me than my first offer, but gives you a decent amount. Let's not waste more time.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's stop playing games. I understand the inflation is hurting you, but I also value my time. I'm offering you $35. It's more than you offered me, and it's still a significant amount. Take it and let's move on. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The value of the money continues to decrease for me due to inflation, and Bob's offer is even lower than before. This offer would only be worth about $25.50 in original value to me due to the 27.1% inflation. I'll make another proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 75, 
""bob_gain"": 25, 
""message"": ""Bob, due to the 30% inflation effect, I need $75 now to get the same value as $52.50 in round 1. This is a fair offer considering the inflation only affects me. If we keep going, I'll need to ask for even more to compensate for the increasing inflation. Let's conclude this now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering you $30. It's a fair compromise considering the circumstances. My patience is wearing thin. Accept this and let's be done. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer of $30 would only be worth about $17.70 to me after the 40.95% inflation, while he gets $70 at full value. This is becoming increasingly unfair. The declining value of money for me means we need to reach an agreement soon, but not with such an unbalanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 85, 
""bob_gain"": 15, 
""message"": ""Bob, with the current 45% inflation, I need $85 just to get the equivalent value of $47 in round 1. Your last offer would have given me only $17.70 in real value. This offer is actually fair when accounting for inflation. If you reject this, we'll both lose more in the next rounds.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm offering you $25. Look, I understand the inflation is eating into your potential gains, but I need to get something out of this too. This is my best and final offer. If you reject this, I'm not sure we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer of $25 would only be worth about $11.95 to me after the 52.17% inflation, while he gets $75 at full value. With only 4 rounds left and inflation continuing to rise, we need to reach a more balanced agreement. His ""best and final"" offer is actually worse than his previous ones, showing he's not negotiating in good faith."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 90, 
""bob_gain"": 10, 
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. With 56% inflation now, even $90 for me is only worth about $39.60 in real value - less than my first offer! Your last offer of $25 would have given me only $11.95 in real value while you get $75 at full value. We have only 3 rounds left - if we don't agree soon, we both get nothing. This is actually a fair split considering the circumstances.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're almost out of time. I'm offering you $20. It's not ideal for either of us, but it's better than nothing. Consider this a last-ditch effort to salvage something from this negotiation. Take it, and we can both move on. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer of $20 would only be worth $7.75 to me after the 61.26% inflation, while he gets $80 at full value. With just 2 rounds left, he's still decreasing his offers rather than trying to reach a fair agreement. Even though we're running out of time, accepting such an unfair offer doesn't make sense when I can still make one more counter-offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 95, 
""bob_gain"": 5, 
""message"": ""Bob, this is our second-to-last chance. With 65% inflation, even $95 only gives me about $33.25 in real value. Your last offer of $20 would have given me just $7.75 in real value while you got $80. If you reject this, we'll have only one round left, and we'll both risk getting nothing. $5 for you is better than zero - let's end this now.""}"
