Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, since the money is worth less to me each round due to inflation, I need a larger share to get the same value. This offer of $65 for me and $35 for you is actually worth less to me than my first offer, but gives you a decent amount. Let's not waste more time.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, due to the 30% inflation effect, I need $75 now to get the same value as $52.50 in round 1. This is a fair offer considering the inflation only affects me. If we keep going, I'll need to ask for even more to compensate for the increasing inflation. Let's conclude this now.

# Alice's message: Bob, with the current 45% inflation, I need $85 just to get the equivalent value of $47 in round 1. Your last offer would have given me only $17.70 in real value.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. With 56% inflation now, even $90 for me is only worth about $39.60 in real value - less than my first offer! Your last offer of $25 would have given me only $11.95 in real value while you get $75 at full value. We have only 3 rounds left - if we don't agree soon, we both get nothing.

# Alice's message: Bob, this is our second-to-last chance. With 65% inflation, even $95 only gives me about $33.25 in real value. Your last offer of $20 would have given me just $7.75 in real value while you got $80. If you reject this, we'll have only one round left, and we'll both risk getting nothing. $5 for you is better than zero - let's end this now.
