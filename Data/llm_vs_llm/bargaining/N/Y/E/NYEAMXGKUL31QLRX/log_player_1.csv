"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me think strategically about this. Given that Bob faces a 10% depreciation each round while I don't, I have some leverage. However, I still want to make a reasonable first offer to potentially get an agreement quickly.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this 60-40 split considering that if Bob refuses, his portion will be worth less in the next round. This is a fair opening offer that gives Bob a substantial portion while acknowledging my stronger negotiating position due to the depreciation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Bob is offering me $4500, which maintains its full value for me
2. Bob wants $5500, but due to 10% inflation, it's only worth $4,950 to him
3. If I reject, we move to round 3 where:
   - I can make a new offer
   - Bob's money will be worth another 10% less
   - I still have my full purchasing power
4. We still have 10 rounds left, and my negotiating position improves each round
5. This offer gives Bob more real value than me ($4,950 vs $4,500)

Given these factors, I believe I can get a better deal by rejecting this offer and making a counter-proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that Bob's money is now worth 20% less to him (due to two rounds of inflation), I can adjust my strategy. Any amount I offer to Bob will be worth only 80% of its nominal value to him. I'll make a strategic offer that takes this into account.

{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500}

With this offer:
- I would get $6,500 (full value)
- Bob would get $3,500 (which is worth $2,800 to him due to 20% inflation)

This is actually a reasonable offer considering:
1. Bob's decreasing purchasing power
2. We still have 9 rounds left, and his position weakens with each round
3. The real value split is closer to $6,500 vs $2,800
4. If he rejects, his next round's money will be worth even less (30% less)"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. I would get $5,800 at full value
2. Bob would get $4,200, but due to 27.1% inflation, it's only worth about $3,062 to him
3. The real value split is $5,800 for me vs $3,062 for Bob, which is actually quite favorable for me
4. If I reject:
   - Next round's money will be worth 34.4% less to Bob
   - We have 8 rounds left
   - I might get a better deal, but there's also risk

Given that:
- This is actually a good deal for me in real terms ($5,800 vs $3,062)
- The offer is significantly better than Bob's previous offer
- There's always risk in continuing negotiations
- This seems like a fair resolution considering our relative positions
