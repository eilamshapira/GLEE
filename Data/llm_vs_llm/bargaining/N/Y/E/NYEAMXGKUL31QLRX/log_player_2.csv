Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me after each round, I'll make a fair offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Alice's offer, the $3500 I gain would be worth approximately $2830 (3500 * 0.81, since it's 19% less than the original value). 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth even less for me now (10% less each round, so 30% less than the original value after 3 rounds of rejection, considering the first round as round 0 for calculation: 1 - (0.9^3) = 0.271, but for simplicity, let's calculate it as 1 - 0.9 - 0.09 - 0.009 = 0.721 or approximately 28.1% less after 3 rounds of rejection), I'll make a more generous offer to Alice.
