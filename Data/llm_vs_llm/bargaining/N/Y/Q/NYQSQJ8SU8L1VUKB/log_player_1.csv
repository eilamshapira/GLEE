"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'll propose a 30-70 split in your favor. I believe we can reach a fair agreement while accounting for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The reason I accept is that with 20% inflation, my $700,000 is now worth $560,000 in round 1 terms. If I reject and we continue to later rounds, the inflation will reduce the value further. This is still a good deal for me as I get the majority of the money, and it's better to secure this amount now rather than risk further devaluation through additional rounds of negotiation."
