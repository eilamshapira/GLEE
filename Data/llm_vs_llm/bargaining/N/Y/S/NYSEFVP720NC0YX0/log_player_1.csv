"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Split it evenly, no need to wait!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better.  I'm willing to give you a fair share, but I need a bit more to make this worthwhile for me. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept this offer, I'll get $400,000, which is worth 5% less than its original value, so I'll effectively get $380,000.

Since Bob's offer doesn't seem very favorable to me, and I still have 10 rounds left to negotiate, I think I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the original $1,000,000 is now worth 10.25% less to me (5% less in Round 1 and another 5% less in Round 2), and 21% less to Bob (10% less in Round 1 and another 10% less in Round 2, and 1% is added due to compounding), but I don't know the exact inflation rate for Bob. 

To make a reasonable offer, I'll aim for a split that's slightly more favorable to me than the even split, but still leaves room for negotiation.

{""alice_gain"": 520000, 
""bob_gain"": 480000, 
""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground, considering the decreasing value""}"
