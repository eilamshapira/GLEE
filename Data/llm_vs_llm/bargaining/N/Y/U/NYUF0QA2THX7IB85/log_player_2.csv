"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me in this round, the effective amount is $100 * 0.9 = $90. For Alice, it's $100 * 0.95 = $95. 

To make a fair offer, I'll consider the original $100 and split it in a way that seems reasonable, given the decreasing value.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Alice's offer, I'll get $40, but its value is reduced by 19% due to inflation, so the effective value for me is $40 * 0.81 = $32.4.

Given this, I think I can try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, the money is now worth even less for both of us. For me, it's $100 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.81 = $65.61 (10% less in round 2, and then 19% less in round 3, which is cumulative), but to simplify, let's calculate it step by step: 
- Round 1 to 2: $100 * 0.9 = $90
- Round 2 to 3: $90 * 0.9 = $81
- Round 3 to 4: $81 * 0.9 = $72.9

For Alice, the value decreases by 5% in round 2 and then 4.75% in round 3 (cumulative 9.75% decrease), so let's calculate it step by step:
- Round 1 to 2: $100 * 0.95 = $95
- Round 2 to 3: $95 * 0.9525 = $90.4375
- Round 3 to 4: $90.4375 * 0.9525 = $86.15625

However, the task is to divide the original $100, considering these values. I'll aim for a split that reflects our relative losses.
