"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly and avoid inflation losses 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether this offer is fair given the unique conditions of our game, especially the asymmetric inflation that affects me.

While a 50-50 split seems fair on the surface, I have to account for the 20% inflation penalty I face each round. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value to me will already be reduced to 8,000$ (10,000$ Ã— 0.8).

Alice's even split offer gives me 5,000$ right now, which is better than what I might get after several rounds of negotiation when inflation has significantly eroded the money's value for me.
