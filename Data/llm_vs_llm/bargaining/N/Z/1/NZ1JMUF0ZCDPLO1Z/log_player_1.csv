"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me propose a division that considers both our interests, knowing that delays will reduce the value more severely for Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I suggest this split because while it's in my favor, it still gives Bob a substantial portion. Since Bob faces a steeper depreciation rate (20% vs my 10%), they have more incentive to accept now rather than delay and make a counter-offer. This is more favorable than an even split for me, but not so extreme that it would likely trigger a rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept now:
   * I get $4500, but with 10% inflation = $4050 effective value
   * Bob gets $5500, but with 20% inflation = $4400 effective value

2. If I reject and make a new offer:
   * Next round will have even more inflation (20% for Bob, 10% for me)
   * I could propose a different split, but Bob might reject again
   * Further delays reduce value for both of us

Given that I would still get a substantial amount ($4050 in effective value) and the risk of further value erosion in future rounds, I'll accept this offer.
