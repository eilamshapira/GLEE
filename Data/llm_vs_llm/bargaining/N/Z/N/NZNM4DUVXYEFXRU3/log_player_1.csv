"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer to divide the $10,000. Since I know inflation will reduce the value by 5% each round for me, I should make a reasonable first offer that Bob might accept.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm offering an equal split of the money - $5,000 for each of us. This is a fair division that respects both of our interests and avoids the penalty of inflation if we need to continue negotiating."
