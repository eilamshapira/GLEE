"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since this is the first round and I want to make a fair but strategic offer considering the 10% inflation penalty for future rounds, I'll propose a slightly favorable split for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose taking $60 and giving Bob $40, as it's a reasonable starting offer that gives both parties a significant portion while maintaining some advantage for me as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I'll get $45, but it's worth 10% less due to inflation, so effectively $40.5
- If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount will be worth 20% less for me
- Even if I propose a more favorable split next round, the inflation will eat into my gains significantly
- Furthermore, Bob might reject again, leading to even more value loss

Given this, while the offer isn't ideal, the inflation penalty makes it better to accept now rather than risk further devaluation.
