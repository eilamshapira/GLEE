"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50-50 split is the fairest option for both of us. We both deserve an equal share. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, I need to consider that when evaluating Bob's offer.

Bob's offer gives me $500,000, but due to the 10% decrease in value, it's effectively worth $500,000 * 0.9 = $450,000 to me.

Considering this, I think I can do better in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less in each round, and the money Bob gains is worth 20% less, I'll try to take advantage of this.

In Round 1, the value was 100%.
In Round 2, the value was 90% for me and 80% for Bob.
In Round 3, the value is 81% for me (90% * 0.9) and 64% for Bob (80% * 0.8).

Considering this, I'll make an offer that's slightly more favorable to me:

{""alice_gain"": 650000, 
""bob_gain"": 350000, 
""message"": ""Let's end this, I'm being generous considering inflation""}"
