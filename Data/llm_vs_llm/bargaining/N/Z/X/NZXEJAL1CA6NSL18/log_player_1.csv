"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let me propose a fair split while considering the inflation risk.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable first offer that gives both of us a good portion, with a slight advantage to me as the first mover. If Bob declines, the next round's $100 will be worth only $90 to me due to inflation, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept, I get $45, which due to 10% inflation is actually worth $40.50 to me
2. If I reject, I can make another offer next round, but then the money will be worth even less (20% less than original value)
3. Bob's position seems stronger as his inflation rate is lower (5%)
4. Getting $40.50 in real value isn't terrible given the circumstances

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. With asymmetric inflation working against me, and the risk of further devaluation in future rounds, this is a reasonable compromise."
