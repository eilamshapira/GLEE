"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let me propose a fair split while accounting for potential future inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose this split because it's close to equal but slightly in my favor. If Bob rejects it, the next round will have 10% inflation for me, which would make the money less valuable. This offer gives Bob a substantial portion while protecting my interests against inflation risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept, I get $40 but it's worth 10% less, so effectively $36
- If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount I get will be worth 20% less than original value
- This means in the next round, even if I get $60, it would be worth $48 to me
- And Bob might reject again, leading to even more inflation

Given that the inflation penalty will keep increasing and my bargaining position will worsen, I should accept this offer. While not ideal, it's better than risking further devaluation.
