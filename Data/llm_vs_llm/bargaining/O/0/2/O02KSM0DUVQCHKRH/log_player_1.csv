"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to make a fair offer that Bob will likely accept while considering the 5% inflation for me each round.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This gives me a majority share while still offering Bob a substantial portion. Since I face 5% inflation per round if we continue, I want to make an attractive enough offer that Bob accepts immediately, but I also want to secure a good amount for myself."
