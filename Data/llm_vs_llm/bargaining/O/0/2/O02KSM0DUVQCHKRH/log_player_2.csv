"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering me $450,000 while taking $550,000 for herself. Since this is the first round, I need to consider whether it's worth rejecting and making a counter-offer, knowing that inflation will reduce the value by 20% in the next round.

If I reject, the $1,000,000 will effectively be worth $800,000 to me in the next round. If I were to get 60% of that (making a counter-offer of $600,000 for me, $400,000 for Alice), I'd get $480,000, which is only slightly better than the $450,000 offered now.

Given the risk that Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation, accepting $450,000 now seems reasonable.
