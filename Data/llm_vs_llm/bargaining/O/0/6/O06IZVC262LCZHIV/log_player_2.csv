"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly! I propose 60/40, what do you say?

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but let's be reasonable. How about a 55/45 split in your favor?""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's try a 50/50 split this time. Seems fair, considering inflation is eating into my share! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a good deal for Bob now. Accepting a 50/50 split ensures he doesn't risk getting a worse offer later, especially since inflation is only affecting Alice's potential gains, not his."
