"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000, ""message"": ""Let's start fair. I'll take a large share, but I'm willing to negotiate.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since your money loses 10% value each round, this $4000 now is worth more than a larger amount later. Let's make a fair deal and avoid further devaluation of your share. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
