"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take a large share, but I'm willing to negotiate. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me only 10% of the total amount ($1000), which is quite low. Given that:

1. We have 11 more rounds available
2. Alice's money loses 10% value each round
3. I can make the next offer if I reject
4. My money doesn't lose value

I should reject this offer. In the next round, I can propose a more favorable split, and Alice will need to consider that her money will be worth less if she rejects.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice's money loses 10% value each round, I should use this to negotiate a better deal. Her $9000 from round 1 would only be worth $8100 to her in this round, so I can leverage this.

{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Since your money loses 10% value each round, this $4000 now is worth more than a larger amount later. Let's make a fair deal and avoid further devaluation of your share.""}"
