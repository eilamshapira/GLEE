"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a slightly higher split for me since I'm affected by 10% inflation each round. This way we both benefit from agreeing early, as the total value will decrease if we keep negotiating. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. This way, neither of us feels disadvantaged, and we can both walk away happy. Considering the inflation, it's better to settle quickly. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
