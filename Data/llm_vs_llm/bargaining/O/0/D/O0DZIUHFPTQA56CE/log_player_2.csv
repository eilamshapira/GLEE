"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a slightly higher split for me since I'm affected by 10% inflation each round. This way we both benefit from agreeing early, as the total value will decrease if we keep negotiating. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000
