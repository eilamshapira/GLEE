"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing an even 50-50 split, which would give me $5,000. This seems fair at first glance, but I need to remember that inflation will reduce the value by 20% each round. If I reject and make a counter-offer, Alice might reject it, and we'd lose value.

Given that the money loses 20% of its value for me each round, accepting now gives me the full $5,000 without any loss. If we go another round, even if I got more, it would be worth less to me.
