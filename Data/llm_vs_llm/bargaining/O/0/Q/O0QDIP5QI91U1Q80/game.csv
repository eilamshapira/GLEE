1.0,99.0,"Alice, I understand your desire for a fair share, but consider the inflation penalty you'll face if we move to later rounds. Accept this offer now—though it gives you only $1 nominally, that's better than risking nearly nothing in the next round.",Bob,2,

3.0,97.0,"Alice, I understand your desire for fairness, but each passing round further erodes the value of your share—by round 3 it was already 19% less, and it's set to decrease even more soon. Although 3 dollars might seem small nominally, its current worth is far better than what you'd secure if we delay further. Accept this offer now to protect your real value.",Bob,4,

,,,Bob,5,reject
45.0,55.0,"Alice, with each round the value of your share drops even further – by now it's only worth about 59% of its nominal amount. If you reject this offer, you'll have to wait until round 7 where your money will be even more discounted, and the bargaining power may not work out any better. I’m offering you $45 nominal (worth roughly $26.57 in real value) now versus a riskier, lower effective payoff later. Let's avoid further losses and agree to this near-fair split.",Bob,6,
