"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire for a fair share, but consider the inflation penalty you'll face if we move to later rounds. Accept this offer now—though it gives you only $1 nominally, that's better than risking nearly nothing in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire for fairness, but each passing round further erodes the value of your share—by round 3 it was already 19% less, and it's set to decrease even more soon. Although 3 dollars might seem small nominally, its current worth is far better than what you'd secure if we delay further. Accept this offer now to protect your real value.

# Bob gain: 97

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, with each round the value of your share drops even further – by now it's only worth about 59% of its nominal amount. If you reject this offer, you'll have to wait until round 7 where your money will be even more discounted, and the bargaining power may not work out any better. I’m offering you $45 nominal (worth roughly $26.57 in real value) now versus a riskier, lower effective payoff later. Let's avoid further losses and agree to this near-fair split. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
