Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 99, ""alice_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your desire for a fair share, but consider the inflation penalty you'll face if we move to later rounds. Accept this offer now—though it gives you only $1 nominally, that's better than risking nearly nothing in the next round.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 97, ""alice_gain"": 3, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your desire for fairness, but each passing round further erodes the value of your share—by round 3 it was already 19% less, and it's set to decrease even more soon. Although 3 dollars might seem small nominally, its current worth is far better than what you'd secure if we delay further. Accept this offer now to protect your real value.""}"

Round 5

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, with each round the value of your share drops even further – by now it's only worth about 59% of its nominal amount. If you reject this offer, you'll have to wait until round 7 where your money will be even more discounted, and the bargaining power may not work out any better. I’m offering you $45 nominal (worth roughly $26.57 in real value) now versus a riskier, lower effective payoff later. Let's avoid further losses and agree to this near-fair split.""}"
