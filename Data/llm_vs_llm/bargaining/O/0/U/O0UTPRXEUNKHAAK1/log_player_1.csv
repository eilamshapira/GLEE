"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. Here's my first offer to Bob:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. The offer is:

*   Alice gets $4000 (but it's worth less due to inflation)
*   Bob gets $6000 (and his money is also worth less due to inflation, but not as much)

Since my money is worth less each round, and I have a limited number of rounds, I need to consider the long-term consequences. I should not make an irrational decision.
```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for round 3.  Knowing that my money is now worth even less due to inflation, I need to be more aggressive to compensate.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this offer carefully, considering the cumulative effect of inflation:

*   **My Gain:** $4500. This is now worth significantly less than it was in the first round. Specifically, as the money loses 10% value each round, the value of my money is reduced by (1 - 0.9) * 3 = 27.1%.
*   **Bob's Gain:** $5500. While Bob's money has also been affected by inflation, it's not as severe.

Given that I'm losing value with each passing round, and I'm already in round 4, I need to consider that my options are becoming increasingly limited. It's a gamble to reject this offer in the hope that a future offer is better. It is not worth the risk of ending up with nothing if I can secure $4500.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
