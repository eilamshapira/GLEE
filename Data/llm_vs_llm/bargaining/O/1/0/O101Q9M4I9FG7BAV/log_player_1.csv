"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer that takes into account the different inflation rates for Alice and Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose splitting the money with $55 for me and $45 for Bob. Given that inflation affects me more severely (10% per round) than it affects Bob (5% per round), this slightly higher allocation for me helps counterbalance the disadvantage I would face if we need to continue to additional rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 90 
# Bob gain: 10 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer of $90 for me and $10 for him. Even with the 10% inflation penalty for me in this round, I'll receive $90 worth $81 in round 1 value, which is significantly better than my initial offer of $55. This is a good outcome for me, so I'll accept and end the game."
