"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an initial offer to Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing a slightly favorable division for me, offering 55% to myself and 45% to Bob. Given that there's 20% inflation for me in each subsequent round, it's strategic to secure a good deal early on. This is a fair starting point that gives both of us a substantial portion of the money, while acknowledging that I have a disadvantage if negotiations drag on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's 50/50 split offer. While it's slightly less favorable than my initial proposal, the 20% inflation penalty for me makes this a reasonable deal to take now. If I were to reject and make a counter-offer in round 3, even if Bob accepted, my share would be worth substantially less due to compounding inflation. A $500,000 share now (worth $400,000 after this round's inflation) is better than risking further devaluation in future rounds."
