"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split that accounts for the fact that inflation affects me more severely than Bob. Since I lose 10% value per round compared to Bob's 5%, I should aim for a slightly higher share to offset this disadvantage.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose to take $55 while giving Bob $45. This slightly higher share for me helps compensate for my higher inflation rate, while still being reasonably fair to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Due to inflation, if I accept this 50/50 split now:
   * My $50 is worth 10% less → effectively $45
   * Bob's $50 is worth 5% less → effectively $47.50
2. If I reject, I can make another offer, but we'll both lose more value
3. This is actually a reasonable offer considering we're early in the game and Bob is being fair with an equal split
4. Further delays will reduce the value more significantly for me than for Bob
