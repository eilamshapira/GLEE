"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer that considers the inflation rates for both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

Since Bob faces a higher inflation rate (10% vs my 5%), it's in his interest to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. This offer gives him a substantial portion while still being fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make another offer that accounts for the inflation rates so far.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}

This is a more generous offer to Bob than my first proposal, acknowledging that we're now in round 3. With Bob's higher inflation rate of 10% per round, it would be rational for him to accept this offer rather than continue to lose value. This division still provides me with a fair share while being more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given the increasing impact of inflation, I'll adjust my offer to better account for our different inflation rates:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a perfectly even 50-50 split. At this point, due to the compounding inflation rates (my money is worth 19% less than round 1, while Bob's is worth 34.4% less), it's increasingly important for both of us to reach an agreement. This fair split acknowledges the inflation pressure on both sides and should be appealing to Bob as his money continues to lose value faster than mine."
