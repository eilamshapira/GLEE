"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100, which means she would get $60. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, I'll be affected by 10% inflation, meaning the $100 would only be worth $90 to me. 

If I reject and offer a more favorable split next round, Alice might reject my offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation for me. Since $40 is a substantial portion and inflation will reduce my potential gains in future rounds, accepting now might be the rational choice.
