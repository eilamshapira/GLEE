60.0,40.0,Let's split the money. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a fair offer considering I'm more affected by inflation as time goes on.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,My turn! I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. It's a reasonable offer considering the inflation effect on me. Let's settle this quickly!,Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. The value decreases quickly. I'll meet you in the middle - 55/45 my way. It benefits us both to close the deal now.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
50.0,50.0,"Let's split it down the middle, 50/50. With inflation eating away at our potential gains, it's time to be fair and settle this quickly before we both lose out.",Bob,4,
