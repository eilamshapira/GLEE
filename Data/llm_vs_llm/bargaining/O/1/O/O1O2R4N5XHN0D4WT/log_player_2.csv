"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With a 50-50 split, I would get $50. If I reject and propose in the next round, I would be working with $90 total (due to 10% inflation), so even if I could get a better percentage, the absolute amount might be lower.

$50 now is better than risking getting less in the next round due to inflation. Plus, this is a fair offer that reflects equal division.
