"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer as Alice. I want to be fair but also consider the inflation effect on my end.

{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000}

I propose a slightly favorable split for me since I know I'll face 5% inflation with each round, which reduces the value of my share if negotiations drag on. I believe this is a reasonable starting point that leaves plenty for both of us."
