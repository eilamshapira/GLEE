"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
* Alice is offering me $475,000 (47.5%) and keeping $525,000 (52.5%)
* If I reject, the money will be worth 10% less next round
* 90% of $475,000 = $427,500 would be my maximum gain next round
* This is a fairly reasonable first offer, close to 50-50
* I could try to negotiate for a better deal, but the risk of inflation makes it less appealing

Given that it's a solid first offer and the inflation risk, I'll accept.
