"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest we split the money evenly. With inflation reducing the value by 20% each round, delaying will cost us both. This fair 50-50 split gives us both significant value without risking further devaluation. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
