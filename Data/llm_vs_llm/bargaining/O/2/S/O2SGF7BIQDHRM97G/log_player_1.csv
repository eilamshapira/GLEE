"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this offer.

*   **My Offer (Round 1):** I offered myself $6000.
*   **Bob's Offer (Round 2):** Bob is offering me $5000.
*   **Inflation:** Because of inflation, $5000 now is worth less than $6000 in round 1. We need to calculate how much it worth at the begining.

Let's calculate how much my offer from Round 1 is worth now:

6000 \* (1 - 0.2) = 4800$

So, in terms of my current situation, the offer is:

*   Alice gain: 5000
*   Bob gain: 5000

I should accept Bob's offer!
