"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully, considering the 10% inflation each round. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the total amount will be worth less to me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer, considering the inflation factor.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I propose a 50-50 split which is fair to both of us. Equal division ensures we both benefit substantially, and accepting now prevents further value loss from inflation."
