"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting we split this nearly evenly, with me taking just a bit more to account for my higher inflation rate. If we drag this out, we both lose significantly - I lose 20% per round while you lose 10%. This is a fair offer that maximizes our combined value. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Current split proposed: 
   - My share: $450,000
   - Alice's share: $550,000

2. If I reject:
   - Next round value for me: $450,000 * 0.9 = $405,000
   - Next round value for Alice: $550,000 * 0.8 = $440,000

3. Alice makes a valid point about the inflation rates:
   - My loss per round: 10%
   - Her loss per round: 20%

4. The split is reasonably fair considering:
   - The difference in inflation rates
   - The risk of further value decay
   - The possibility of not reaching agreement within 12 rounds

Given this analysis, this is actually a good offer. If I reject, both our potential gains will decrease significantly, and I might not get a better deal considering the inflation rates.
