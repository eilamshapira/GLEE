60.0,40.0,Let's split this fairly. I'm offering you $40 which is a good deal considering the 5% inflation penalty you face each round.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Let's be reasonable, Alice. I'll take a slight hit with $55, considering the inflation. This offer ensures you get a decent share.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
65.0,35.0,"Bob, due to the two rounds of inflation you've faced, this $35 is becoming less valuable to you with each rejection. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances - let's finish this now.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
50.0,50.0,"Alice, let's stop wasting time. The inflation is only hurting me. A 50/50 split is the fairest option at this point.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
70.0,30.0,"Bob, you're now facing nearly 20% inflation penalty, making any future negotiations less favorable for you. This $30 now is worth more than a larger amount in future rounds. Let's conclude this deal.",Alice,5,
