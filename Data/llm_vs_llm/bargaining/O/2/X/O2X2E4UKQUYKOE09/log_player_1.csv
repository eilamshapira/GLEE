"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split this fairly. I'm offering you $40 which is a good deal considering the 5% inflation penalty you face each round.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, Alice. I'll take a slight hit with $55, considering the inflation. This offer ensures you get a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this:
1. If I accept now, I get $45
2. If I reject:
   - We go to next round where I can make an offer
   - Bob will face another 5% inflation penalty
   - I could potentially get more, but risking further back-and-forth

$45 is less than my initial offer of $60, and Bob's facing inflation means I might get a better deal in the next round. I'll reject this.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Bob, due to the two rounds of inflation you've faced, this $35 is becoming less valuable to you with each rejection. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances - let's finish this now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's stop wasting time. The inflation is only hurting me. A 50/50 split is the fairest option at this point. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept now, I get $50
2. If I reject:
   - Next round I can make an offer
   - Bob will face another 5% inflation penalty (total ~19%)
   - Given the increasing inflation pressure on Bob, I could likely get a better deal

Since Bob is facing significant inflation (14.26%) and still offering me less than my previous offer of $65, I'll reject this and push for a better deal.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Bob, you're now facing nearly 20% inflation penalty, making any future negotiations less favorable for you. This $30 now is worth more than a larger amount in future rounds. Let's conclude this deal.""}"
