"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'd like to propose that I receive $55 while you get $45. This way we settle immediately and I avoid the 5% depreciation in value that comes with additional rounds. I hope you see the benefit of a prompt agreement. Looking forward to your response! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider the offer carefully. Alice is offering me $45 while she takes $55, and mentions that she avoids 5% depreciation with an immediate agreement. However, I know that my inflation penalty is 10% per round, not 5%.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value will be worth 10% less to me, so the $100 would effectively be worth $90 from my perspective. This means I'd need to get more than $45 out of $90 (which is 50% of the reduced pot) to make rejection worthwhile.

Since $45 is exactly 50% of what I could potentially get in the next round ($90), and there's uncertainty about whether Alice would accept my counter-offer, accepting this initial offer seems reasonable.
