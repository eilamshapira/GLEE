"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40.  It's important to settle this quickly due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Alice's offer of a 60/40 split, where I would get $400,000. While this isn't an even split, I need to be mindful of the 20% inflation penalty per round if I reject.

If I reject and propose in the next round, the total value would be worth 20% less to me. So even if I proposed a 50/50 split next round, I'd get $500,000 but it would be worth only $400,000 to me due to inflation.

Given this inflation pressure and the reasonable offer, I'll accept.
