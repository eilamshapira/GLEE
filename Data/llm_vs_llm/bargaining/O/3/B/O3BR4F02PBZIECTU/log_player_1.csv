"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"":900000,""bob_gain"":100000,""message"":""Let's keep it simple. I take 90% and you take 10%. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since you face 10% devaluation per round and I don't, it's in your interest to agree quickly. I'm offering you a fair 40% share, which is much better than what you'll get if we keep negotiating. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
