"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's keep it simple. I take 90% and you take 10%. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Explanation (not part of game response): This offer is extremely unfair. Since Alice faces a 10% devaluation per round while I don't face any devaluation, I have a stronger negotiating position. I should be able to get a much better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Since you face 10% devaluation per round and I don't, it's in your interest to agree quickly. I'm offering you a fair 40% share, which is much better than what you'll get if we keep negotiating.""}"
