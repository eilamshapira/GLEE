Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even with inflation, Alice's offer is still heavily skewed in her favor.  I'm hoping to secure a slightly better deal in the next round where I propose. The risk of holding out is calculated, as I'm aware the pot shrinks with each round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800} 

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking to a proposal that's advantageous for me while still being reasonably attractive to Alice. The inflation is working against both of us, making it increasingly risky to wait for ideal offers."
