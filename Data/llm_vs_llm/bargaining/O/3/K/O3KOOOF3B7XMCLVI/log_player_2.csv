"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000 (40%)
2. If I reject, we go to next round where:
   - I can make a counter-offer
   - Total value decreases by 20% to $8,000
   - I would need to secure more than $4,000 from $8,000 to be better off

While 40/60 split isn't exactly equal, accepting now guarantees me $4,000. If I reject, I risk ending up with less due to the 20% depreciation, even if I get a larger percentage in the next round.

However, I believe I can negotiate a fairer split, and even with the 20% depreciation, I could still propose a better deal for myself in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while acknowledging the time pressure due to depreciation:

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, I propose a perfectly equal 50-50 split. This is fair for both of us, and given the 20% depreciation per round, we should aim to conclude quickly. Let's be reasonable and equal partners.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the sentiment of a 50-50 split, but it's important to recognize that I made the first move.  This offer keeps us close to that even split while acknowledging the time value in this scenario.  Let's close this out. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is now offering me $4,500 (45%) vs $5,500 (55%)
2. Due to 36% inflation, this $4,500 is actually worth $2,880 in original value
3. If I reject:
   - Next round will have another 20% depreciation
   - The money will be worth 49% less than original value
   - I would need to secure significantly more to make up for the loss

My initial rejection of $4,000 has already cost us value. While this split still isn't 50-50, continuing to negotiate will destroy more value. Alice has moved towards a more equitable split (from 40-60 to 45-55), and given the significant inflation, I should accept this offer before we lose more value.
