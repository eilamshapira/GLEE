"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting we split the money with me getting $55 and you getting $45. This is fair because if we delay, your share loses 5% value each round, while mine doesn't. Accepting now gives you more actual value than waiting. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer gives me $45
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
   * The total value for me will be worth 5% less (due to inflation)
   * Alice has no inflation penalty
   * Alice could reject my offer, leading to further rounds and more value loss for me

Alice's reasoning about inflation affecting my share is valid. If I reject and we go another round, even if I ask for more, the 5% inflation means I'd need to get at least $47.37 just to break even with the current $45 offer.

Given that Alice could reject my counter-offer, leading to even more rounds and value loss, accepting $45 now is likely the best strategic choice.
