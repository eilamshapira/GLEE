"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, but slightly in my favor since Bob has the power to accept/reject and make a counter-offer.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this division of $550,000 for me and $450,000 for Bob. This is a reasonable split that gives both of us a substantial amount while being fair enough that Bob might accept it rather than risk the 5% inflation penalty by rejecting and counter-offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept this offer, I'll get $480,000 with 5% inflation penalty, meaning effectively $456,000
2. If I reject, I can make another offer next round, but I'll face another 5% inflation penalty
3. Bob's current offer is fairly reasonable, giving me 48% of the total
4. Going to another round means risking further value loss and potential for an even worse deal

Given these factors, I'll accept this offer. While it's less than my initial proposal, it's still a fair split and the inflation penalty makes it risky to continue negotiating.
