"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice's offer gives me the entire $10,000, which seems generous, I need to consider if this is genuinely the best option given the inflation mechanics.

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but the money will be worth 20% less to me (effectively $8,000 in value). If we continue negotiating for multiple rounds, the value will decrease further for me.

Since Alice is offering me the maximum possible amount in the very first round, and any delay would only reduce the value to me, this is clearly the optimal outcome from my perspective.
