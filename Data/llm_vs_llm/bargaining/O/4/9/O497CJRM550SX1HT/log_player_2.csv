"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $400,000 out of $1,000,000
2. If I reject, the value will decrease by 10% in the next round
3. In the next round, the total value for me would be $900,000, but I would get to make the proposal

Since this is the first round and I still have many rounds left, I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-proposal. Even with the 10% inflation, I could propose a more favorable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since this is my turn to propose, I'll make a more balanced offer but slightly in my favor. I need to consider that:
1. Alice might reject if the offer is too unfair
2. If she rejects, the next round will be worth 10% less for me
3. A reasonable offer now might be better than risking further inflation

I'll propose a 55-45 split in my favor:

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

This is a more balanced offer than Alice's initial proposal, and it gives her a significant portion while still being advantageous for me. If she rejects, we'll both lose value due to inflation, so this should be appealing enough for her to consider accepting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is now offering me $450,000
2. Due to 19% inflation, this $450,000 is actually worth $364,500 to me
3. If I reject, the next round will have 29% inflation for me
4. The offer is more balanced than her first offer
5. We've already gone through 2 rounds, and have 10 left
6. Further negotiations might lead to more value loss due to inflation

Given that:
- Alice has improved her offer significantly from the first round
- The inflation is starting to significantly impact my potential gains
- There's risk in continuing negotiations
- This is a relatively fair offer
