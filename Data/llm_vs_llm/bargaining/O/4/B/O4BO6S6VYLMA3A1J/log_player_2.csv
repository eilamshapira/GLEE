"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Alice is offering me $400,000 of the $1,000,000 pot. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but the money will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation, meaning the entire pot would effectively be worth $900,000 to me.

This means that if I reject, even if I managed to get a better split in the next round, I'd need to secure significantly more than $400,000 to make up for the inflation loss. For example, even if I got $500,000 in the next round, it would only be worth $450,000 to me due to inflation.

While a 50-50 split might seem more ""fair,"" the risk of losing value through inflation and the possibility that Alice might reject my counter-offer makes the current 60-40 split a reasonable offer.
