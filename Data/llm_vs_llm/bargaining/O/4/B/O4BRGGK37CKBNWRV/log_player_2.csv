"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

* If I accept now, I get $40
* If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me
* So in the next round, $100 will effectively be worth $80 to me
* I should try to get more than $40, but I need to consider the diminishing value

I'll reject this offer since I believe I can get a better deal even accounting for the 20% inflation penalty.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let me make a strategic offer...

Since money is now worth 20% less to me, I need to aim for a higher nominal amount to make it worthwhile having rejected the previous offer.

I'll propose a 50-50 split, which is:
1. Fair and likely to be accepted
2. Better for me than the previous offer ($50 * 0.8 = $40 effective value for me, but I'm offering something that appears more equitable to Alice)

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

* Current offer: $45, but with 36% inflation, it's effectively worth $28.80 to me
* If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the money will be worth 48.8% less to me
* My $45 would be worth even less in the next round
* The first offer ($40 with no inflation) was actually better than both this one and what I could get in the next round
* I made a mistake rejecting the first offer

Given that the value keeps decreasing for me and Alice knows she has this advantage, I should accept this offer before it gets worse.
