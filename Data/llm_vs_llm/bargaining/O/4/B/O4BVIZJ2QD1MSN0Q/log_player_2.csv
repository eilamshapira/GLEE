"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

A 50-50 split seems fair at first glance. However, if I reject, I'll make the next offer. The downside is that inflation will reduce my value by 5%, meaning the $10,000 total will be worth $9,500 to me in the next round.

If I accept now:
- I get $5,000
- No inflation loss

If I reject and propose next round:
- Maximum I could propose for myself would be affected by 5% inflation
- Alice might reject my offer, leading to further inflation losses
- The negotiation could drag on, making things worse

Given that it's a fair split and the risk of inflation, I'll accept.
