600000.0,400000.0,"Given that my money loses value much faster than yours (20% vs 5% per round), I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering the time pressure affects me more significantly.",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"I appreciate your proposal, but it doesn't account for the fact that my money is also losing value, albeit at a slower rate. A 55-45 split in my favor is a fair compromise, considering the time pressure is still a factor.",Bob,2,

700000.0,300000.0,"Let's be practical about this. My previous $600K offer is now only worth $480K to me due to 20% inflation, while your $400K would still be worth $380K. Your counter-offer was even worse for me. I'm proposing 70-30 to compensate for the severe depreciation I'm facing. If we continue further, both of us will lose more value.",Alice,3,
