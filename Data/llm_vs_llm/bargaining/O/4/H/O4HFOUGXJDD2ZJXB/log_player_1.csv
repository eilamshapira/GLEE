Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Let me propose a fair split that accounts for the different inflation rates we face.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your proposal, but it doesn't account for the fact that my money is also losing value, albeit at a slower rate. A 55-45 split in my favor is a fair compromise, considering the time pressure is still a factor. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The inflation rates make this offer particularly unfavorable for me. Since my money depreciates at 20% per round, my $450,000 is now only worth $360,000 in round 1 terms. Meanwhile, Bob's $550,000 is worth $522,500 in round 1 terms due to the 5% depreciation. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round that better accounts for these dynamics."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 700000,
""bob_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Let's be practical about this. My previous $600K offer is now only worth $480K to me due to 20% inflation, while your $400K would still be worth $380K. Your counter-offer was even worse for me. I'm proposing 70-30 to compensate for the severe depreciation I'm facing. If we continue further, both of us will lose more value.""}"
