"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given that my money loses value much faster than yours (20% vs 5% per round), I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering the time pressure affects me more significantly. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be practical about this. My previous $600K offer is now only worth $480K to me due to 20% inflation, while your $400K would still be worth $380K. Your counter-offer was even worse for me. I'm proposing 70-30 to compensate for the severe depreciation I'm facing. If we continue further, both of us will lose more value. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000
