"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I propose we split it 60-40 in my favor. It's a fair start considering I'm taking the initiative. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $40 while she gets $60. While it's not an even split, if I reject it, we'll lose 20% of the total value in the next round. That means we'll only be dividing $80 instead of $100.

If I reject and propose a more favorable split next round, Alice might reject it too, leading to further depreciation. The $40 I'm being offered now would be worth more than even a larger percentage of a depreciated amount in later rounds.

However, I think I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round, even accounting for the 20% depreciation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be fair and split it 50-50. Due to the 20% inflation, we're already dealing with $80 in real value. An equal split is the most rational choice to avoid further losses for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see your point about fairness, but considering the inflation and the fact that we're now dealing with $64 in real value, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This way, we both get more than a 50-50 split would give us now, and it compensates for my initial offer. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:
1. We're now dealing with effectively $64 due to two rounds of inflation (36% less)
2. Alice is offering me $45, which in real value is worth $28.80 (after 36% inflation)
3. If I reject, the next round will have 48% total inflation, making the pot worth only $52 in real value
4. Even if I could get a better percentage split in the next round, the actual value would likely be lower due to inflation

While Alice's split still favors her slightly, the offer is reasonable given the declining value, and continuing to negotiate would likely result in both of us getting less real value.
