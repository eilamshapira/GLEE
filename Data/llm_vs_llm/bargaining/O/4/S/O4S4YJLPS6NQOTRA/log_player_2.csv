"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4872 
# Alice gain: 5128 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether this offer is fair and reasonable.

Alice is offering me $4,872 out of the $10,000, which is 48.72% of the total. She would keep $5,128, which is 51.28%.

If I reject this offer, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but the total amount will be worth 5% less (so only $9,500 total value). However, I would get to decide the split.

While Alice's offer isn't exactly 50-50, it's quite close. Rejecting would mean losing $500 of total value, and there's no guarantee Alice would accept a more favorable offer from me in the next round.
