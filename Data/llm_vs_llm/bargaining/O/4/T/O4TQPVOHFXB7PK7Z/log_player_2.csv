"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's be reasonable and agree quickly! I'm offering a slight advantage to myself to account for my time, but this is a very fair split. Accept now and we both win! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $450,000 while she gets $550,000. Since this is the first round and there's no inflation for me, I have the option to reject and make my own proposal next round.

Given that we have 12 rounds total and I don't know how inflation affects Alice, I'll make a counter-proposal that might be more favorable to me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split, closer to 50/50, while acknowledging Alice's initial offer.

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I think a 50/50 split is the fairest approach since we're both contributing equally to this negotiation. This way we both walk away with half a million dollars, which is a significant win for both of us. Let's agree and conclude this quickly.""}"
