"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a fair initial offer with an equal split of the money. Since there's no inflation for me, accepting now would guarantee me $5,000, which is a reasonable outcome. However, I could potentially get more by making a counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a slight adjustment in my favor while still keeping the offer reasonably fair for Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I propose I receive $5,500 and Alice receives $4,500. This is a modest increase for me while still offering Alice a substantial portion of the money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5800 
# Alice gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has increased her offer to me quite significantly, now offering me $5,800. This is better than my previous proposal where I asked for $5,500. Since there's no inflation for me, this $5,800 is worth the full value. Given that Alice is facing significant inflation (36%), it makes sense that she's willing to offer me more to conclude the deal sooner.
