6000.0,4000.0,I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I face a 5% loss in value each round. This is fair and allows us both to benefit without delay.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Given the inflation affecting your share more significantly, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This offer considers your 5% loss per round but also reflects the value I place on concluding the game swiftly.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5700.0,4300.0,"Let's be practical - with my 10% total loss from inflation so far, this split is actually fair for both of us. My $5700 is worth only $5130 to me now. Further delays will only reduce value for me while you lose nothing. This is a reasonable compromise.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Considering the significant impact of inflation on your share, now at nearly 15% loss, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This offer takes into account your urgency to settle while still providing you with a substantial amount despite the reduced value.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"With my 19.26% total loss from inflation now, this split actually means I'm effectively getting only $4441 in original value while you get $4500. This is already slightly in your favor. If you reject this, we both lose value - let's conclude this fairly now.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
3500.0,6500.0,"With your share now facing over 23% inflation loss, I'm proposing a 65-35 split in my favor. This reflects the urgency to conclude the game while still providing you with a meaningful amount, despite the decreased value due to inflation.",Bob,6,
