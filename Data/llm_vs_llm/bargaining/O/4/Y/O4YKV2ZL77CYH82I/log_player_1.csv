"Round 1

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the inflation affecting your share more significantly, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This offer considers your 5% loss per round but also reflects the value I place on concluding the game swiftly. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is not a good offer considering I face inflation pressure and Bob doesn't. I'll make a better counter-offer in the next round, even accounting for the 5% loss I'll face."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5700,
""bob_gain"": 4300,
""message"": ""Let's be practical - with my 10% total loss from inflation so far, this split is actually fair for both of us. My $5700 is worth only $5130 to me now. Further delays will only reduce value for me while you lose nothing. This is a reasonable compromise.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the significant impact of inflation on your share, now at nearly 15% loss, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This offer takes into account your urgency to settle while still providing you with a substantial amount despite the reduced value. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is an even worse offer than before, trying to take advantage of my inflation pressure. The reduced value means I would only effectively receive $3,426 in original value terms. I'll make another proposal, even though I'll face further loss."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""With my 19.26% total loss from inflation now, this split actually means I'm effectively getting only $4,441 in original value while you get $4,500. This is already slightly in your favor. If you reject this, we both lose value - let's conclude this fairly now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: With your share now facing over 23% inflation loss, I'm proposing a 65-35 split in my favor. This reflects the urgency to conclude the game while still providing you with a meaningful amount, despite the decreased value due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While not ideal, with the mounting inflation pressure (22.62% loss), my $3,500 is worth about $2,708 in original value terms. If I reject, the next round would bring even more value loss, and Bob seems committed to pushing for increasingly unfavorable terms. Better to conclude now than risk further deterioration of value."
