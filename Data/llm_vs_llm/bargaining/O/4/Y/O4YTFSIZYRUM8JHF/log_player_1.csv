"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair initial offer to Bob, considering we both want to maximize our gains and need to account for the 5% inflation penalty for declining.

{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000}

I propose this split because:
1. It's close to 50-50, which appears fair
2. If Bob declines, the total value will decrease by 5% to $950,000
3. A slightly higher portion for me (52.5%) provides incentive for Bob to accept now rather than risk further inflation
4. Bob still gets a substantial amount ($475,000)"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Bob is offering a perfect 50-50 split ($500,000 each)
2. However, due to 5% inflation, the real value of my $500,000 is now $475,000
3. If I reject, we'll move to round 3 with another 5% inflation
4. I could make a new offer, but Bob might reject again, leading to even more value loss
5. A fair split now is better than risking further devaluation
