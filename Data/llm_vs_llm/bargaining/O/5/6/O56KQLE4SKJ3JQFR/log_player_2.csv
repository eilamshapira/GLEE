"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's keep it fair and simple: we both get an equal share of $500000. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this carefully. Alice is offering me $500,000, which is exactly half of the total amount. However, I need to account for the 20% inflation per round that affects me.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2, the money will be worth 20% less to me, meaning the $1,000,000 pot would effectively be worth $800,000 to me. Even if I could get more than half in the next round, I need to consider if it would exceed the $500,000 I can get now.

This is a fair first offer, and considering the inflation penalty, I should accept it.
