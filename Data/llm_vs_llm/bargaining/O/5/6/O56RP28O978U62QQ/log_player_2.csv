Alice's offer is getting closer to an amount I could accept, but it's still not in my best interest. I need to hold out for a bit more."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 525000, ""alice_gain"": 475000} 

I'm lowering my ask slightly due to the inflation, but I'm still aiming for a larger share. Let's see if Alice is willing to budge a bit more."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5

The effects of inflation are becoming too significant. While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer now is better than risking getting an even lower amount in subsequent rounds."
