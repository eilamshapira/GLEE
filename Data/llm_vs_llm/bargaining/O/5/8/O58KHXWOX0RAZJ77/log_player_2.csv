"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split this fairly. I'm offering you a generous 40$. Let's get this done! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
- Alice is offering me $40 out of $100
- If I reject, the next round will have 5% inflation, so the money will be worth less
- However, I feel I could get a better deal by making a counter-offer
- 40/60 split isn't quite fair when we could do 50/50

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer, acknowledging the time pressure we're both under:

{""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. This way we both win equally, and we avoid losing value to inflation by settling quickly.""}"
