60.0,40.0,"Hey Bob, I propose we split it 60-40 in my favor. It's a fair start considering the game's dynamics. What do you think?",Alice,1,

50.0,50.0,"Hi Alice, I understand you wanted a 60-40 split, but I think a 50-50 split is the fairest approach. I'm facing a 20% inflation penalty per round, which puts me at a disadvantage the longer we negotiate. This even split benefits both of us and avoids further devaluation. What do you say?",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, I see your point about fairness, but considering the inflation hitting us both, I think a 55-45 split in my favor is reasonable. It's a bit more than your last offer but still close to even. Let's end this before our money loses more value. What do you say?",Alice,3,
