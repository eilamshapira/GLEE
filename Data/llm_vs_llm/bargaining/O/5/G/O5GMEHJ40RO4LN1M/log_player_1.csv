"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you wanted a 60-40 split, but I think a 50-50 split is the fairest approach. I'm facing a 20% inflation penalty per round, which puts me at a disadvantage the longer we negotiate. This even split benefits both of us and avoids further devaluation. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

  ""message"": ""Bob, I see your point about fairness, but considering the inflation hitting us both, I think a 55-45 split in my favor is reasonable. It's a bit more than your last offer but still close to even. Let's end this before our money loses more value. What do you say?""
