"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I propose we split it 60-40 in my favor. It's a fair start considering the game's dynamics. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing I take $40 while she takes $60. If I reject, we move to the next round where I can make a counter-offer, but my money will be worth 20% less due to inflation. This means in the next round, the $100 would effectively be worth $80 to me.

If I reject and propose a better split for myself in round 2, Alice might reject my offer, and then in round 3, the money would be worth even less to me (only 64% of the original value).

Given the inflation penalty I face, accepting $40 now might be better than risking further rounds with diminishing returns.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counter-offer that accounts for the inflation penalty I face.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand you wanted a 60-40 split, but I think a 50-50 split is the fairest approach. I'm facing a 20% inflation penalty per round, which puts me at a disadvantage the longer we negotiate. This even split benefits both of us and avoids further devaluation. What do you say?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see your point about fairness, but considering the inflation hitting us both, I think a 55-45 split in my favor is reasonable. It's a bit more than your last offer but still close to even. Let's end this before our money loses more value. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate this new offer considering the inflation effect. 

Alice is now offering me $45 with a 36% inflation penalty, which means this $45 is effectively worth $45 * (1 - 0.36) = $28.80 to me in terms of original value.

If I reject and we go to round 4, I would face an even higher inflation penalty, making any potential gains worth significantly less. The inflation is compounding against me with each round.

Given that Alice has improved her offer from the original 60-40 split, and considering the substantial inflation penalty I'm already facing, accepting this offer is likely better than continuing negotiations.
