"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the money 60-40 in my favor. This way, we both get a significant amount, and we can end the game quickly before inflation affects our shares too much. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this carefully. Alice is proposing a 60-40 split in her favor, where I would get $400,000 and she would get $600,000.

If I reject and we go to the next round, inflation will reduce the value by 20% for me and 5% for Alice. This means if I make a counteroffer in round 2, we'd be dividing money that's effectively worth $800,000 to me and $950,000 to Alice.

While a 50-50 split would be fair in theory, the asymmetric inflation rates put me at a disadvantage in negotiations. If we delay too long, my share loses value quickly.

A guaranteed $400,000 now is better than risking further rounds with significant value deterioration for me. Given the inflation difference, this is actually a reasonable first offer.
