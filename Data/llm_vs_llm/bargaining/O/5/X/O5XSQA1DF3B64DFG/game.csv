55.0,45.0,"Hi Alice, I rejected your first offer because a 70/30 split heavily favors you. Since I face a 5% inflation penalty per round and you don't, I propose a more balanced 45/55 split. This is fair considering the time pressure affects only me. Let's conclude this quickly to avoid further devaluation.",Bob,2,
