"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I rejected your first offer because a 70/30 split heavily favors you. Since I face a 5% inflation penalty per round and you don't, I propose a more balanced 45/55 split. This is fair considering the time pressure affects only me. Let's conclude this quickly to avoid further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
