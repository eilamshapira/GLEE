"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's get this done quickly! I propose a 70/30 split. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether this offer is fair, given the time pressure due to the 5% inflation per round for me.

If I reject Alice's offer, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but the total amount will be worth 5% less to me (so effectively I'd be dividing 95$ in my terms). 

While a 50/50 split would be ideally fair, I need to account for the inflation penalty. If we go multiple rounds trying to negotiate, I could end up with less due to the inflation.

Given these considerations:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counter-offer that accounts for the inflation penalty I face.

{""bob_gain"": 45, 
""alice_gain"": 55,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I rejected your first offer because a 70/30 split heavily favors you. Since I face a 5% inflation penalty per round and you don't, I propose a more balanced 45/55 split. This is fair considering the time pressure affects only me. Let's conclude this quickly to avoid further devaluation.""}"
