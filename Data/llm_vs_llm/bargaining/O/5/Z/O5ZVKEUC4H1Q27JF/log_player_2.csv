"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which is perfectly fair
2. If I reject, I'll get to make a counter-offer, but:
   - There's no guarantee Alice will accept
   - The value stays the same for me but might decrease for Alice
3. This is a reasonable first offer that gives me half the money

I'll accept this fair offer.
