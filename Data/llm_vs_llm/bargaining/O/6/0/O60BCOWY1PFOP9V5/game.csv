600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get your money immediately without any inflation impact.",Alice,1,

550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, let's meet in the middle. A 55-45 split in my favor is fair, considering the inflation impact on both of us. This is a balanced offer that gives us both a substantial amount, and we can avoid further value loss from inflation.",Alice,3,

420000.0,580000.0,"Alice, considering the uneven inflation impact, I think a 58-42 split in my favor is more reasonable. I'm taking a bigger hit from inflation, so I need a larger share to compensate.",Bob,4,

520000.0,480000.0,"Bob, I understand your concern about inflation, but we're both losing value with each round. I'm proposing a 52-48 split that's more balanced. This is a fair compromise - if we don't agree soon, we'll both end up with much less due to inflation. Let's make a deal now.",Alice,5,

400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, with the increasing inflation gap, I need to prioritize my share. I'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor. If we don't agree soon, my share will be worth even less, so I'm trying to compensate for the loss.",Bob,6,
