"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get your money immediately without any inflation impact.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think a 55-45 split is more reasonable, considering the inflation impact I'll face if we don't reach an agreement soon. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Let me explain my reasoning: Even with the 10% inflation on my side, getting $450,000 now is worth $405,000 to me (450,000 * 0.9), which is significantly less than what I could get with a better deal. I'll make a new offer in the next round, considering we still have several rounds to negotiate."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Bob, let's meet in the middle. A 55-45 split in my favor is fair, considering the inflation impact on both of us. This is a balanced offer that gives us both a substantial amount, and we can avoid further value loss from inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the uneven inflation impact, I think a 58-42 split in my favor is more reasonable. I'm taking a bigger hit from inflation, so I need a larger share to compensate. 
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Even with 27.1% inflation affecting my share, I still believe we can reach a better deal. My $420,000 would be worth approximately $306,180 after inflation (420,000 * 0.729), which is too low considering the original amount we're dividing. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Bob, I understand your concern about inflation, but we're both losing value with each round. I'm proposing a 52-48 split that's more balanced. This is a fair compromise - if we don't agree soon, we'll both end up with much less due to inflation. Let's make a deal now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, with the increasing inflation gap, I need to prioritize my share. I'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor. If we don't agree soon, my share will be worth even less, so I'm trying to compensate for the loss. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because even though it's not ideal, the rapidly increasing inflation makes delay costly. My $400,000 will be worth approximately $236,200 after the 40.95% inflation (400,000 * 0.5905), and waiting longer would only decrease the value further. With 6 rounds of increasing inflation already passed and the risk of getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds, it's better to secure this amount now rather than risk further depreciation or deadlock."
