Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. How about we split it 50/50? This way, neither of us is shortchanged, considering the inflation I am facing. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the inflation on my end, I think a 54/46 split is more fair at this point. Let's wrap this up. 
# Alice gain: 460000 
# Bob gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough decision as ideally, I'd want a larger share. However, Bob is steadily increasing his offer, and the longer this goes on, the more I lose to inflation. Accepting at 46% now is better than potentially getting even less in later rounds."
