"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose taking $6000 and leaving you with $4000. This is a fair split considering the risk of inflation in the next rounds. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Currently offered: $4000 for me, $6000 for Alice
2. If I reject, we move to next round where:
   * I can make an offer
   * But total value will be worth 20% less ($8000 total)
   * I could propose a better split for myself
   * But Alice might reject, leading to even more value loss

While I could try to negotiate for a better deal, the 20% inflation penalty is significant. If Alice rejects my counter-offer, we'd lose more value than I'd likely gain through negotiation. The current 40/60 split, while not ideal, gives me a guaranteed $4000.
