500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, I'm proposing a 50-50 split which is fair for both of us. Since inflation impacts you more (10% vs my 5%), it's in your interest to accept now rather than continue negotiating. This gives you $500000 immediately, which is better than risking further rounds where your share would be worth even less due to the higher inflation rate you face.",Bob,2,
