Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000,""bob_gain"": 400000,""message"": ""Let's divide the money fairly. How about I take 60% and you take 40%?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm proposing a 50-50 split which is fair for both of us. Since inflation impacts you more (10% vs my 5%), it's in your interest to accept now rather than continue negotiating. This gives you $500000 immediately, which is better than risking further rounds where your share would be worth even less due to the higher inflation rate you face. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
