"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide the money fairly. How about I take 60% and you take 40%? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. 

Alice is proposing I get 400,000$ (40%) while she gets 600,000$ (60%). While this isn't an equal split, I need to consider the inflation penalties for rejecting:
- If I reject, the total value decreases by 5% for me and 10% for Alice
- If I make a counter-offer in round 2, Alice could reject again, further reducing value

Since inflation hurts Alice more than me (10% vs 5%), I have some strategic advantage in later rounds. I could potentially negotiate a better deal by rejecting this initial offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that acknowledges our different inflation rates while being fair enough that Alice should accept.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I'm proposing a 50-50 split which is fair for both of us. Since inflation impacts you more (10% vs my 5%), it's in your interest to accept now rather than continue negotiating. This gives you $500,000 immediately, which is better than risking further rounds where your share would be worth even less due to the higher inflation rate you face.""}"
