"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to calculate the value of the money for me in this round, considering the 20% inflation.

*   **Original Alice gain (from Bob's offer):** 4500
*   **Inflation:** 20% decrease in value

Since the money is worth 20% less now, I need to determine if 4500 is an acceptable amount.

I am fine with this offer.

```json

  ""decision"": ""accept""
