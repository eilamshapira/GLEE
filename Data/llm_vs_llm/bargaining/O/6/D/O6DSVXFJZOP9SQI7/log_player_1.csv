"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 2083.33, ""bob_gain"": 7916.67, ""message"": ""Dear Bob, I propose the following split based on our respective discount factors. Every round costs me 20% of the value while you lose only 5% per round. In light of this, the fair equilibrium (in the spirit of Rubinsteinâ€™s bargaining solution) would have me receiving approximately $2,083.33 and you about $7,916.67. I believe this division wisely reflects our future bargaining power and the inflation penalty. I look forward to your prompt acceptance so we can both secure our best possible outcomes.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Dear Alice, I appreciate your proposal, but I believe a slight adjustment is necessary to better reflect our current positions. Given the inflation rates, I propose $8000 for myself and $2000 for you. This offer takes into account the diminishing value of money for both of us, yet still provides a fair share considering the rounds ahead. I hope you find this proposal agreeable. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
