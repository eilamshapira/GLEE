"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I propose the following split based on our respective discount factors. Every round costs me 20% of the value while you lose only 5% per round. In light of this, the fair equilibrium (in the spirit of Rubinsteinâ€™s bargaining solution) would have me receiving approximately $2083.33 and you about $7916.67. I believe this division wisely reflects our future bargaining power and the inflation penalty. I look forward to your prompt acceptance so we can both secure our best possible outcomes. 
# Bob gain: 7916.67 
# Alice gain: 2083.33

Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 8000,
  ""alice_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Dear Alice, I appreciate your proposal, but I believe a slight adjustment is necessary to better reflect our current positions. Given the inflation rates, I propose $8,000 for myself and $2,000 for you. This offer takes into account the diminishing value of money for both of us, yet still provides a fair share considering the rounds ahead. I hope you find this proposal agreeable.""
