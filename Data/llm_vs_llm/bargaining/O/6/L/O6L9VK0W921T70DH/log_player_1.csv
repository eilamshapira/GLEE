"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll play as Alice in this game where we need to divide $10,000 between Bob and me. Since I'll be making the first offer, I should consider the effects of inflation on my value (20% decrease per round) and try to make a fair but strategic first proposal.

Given that inflation will reduce the value of money for me in later rounds, I have an incentive to reach an agreement sooner. A reasonable opening offer would be to propose a fairly balanced split, but slightly in my favor.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5250 
# Bob gain: 4750 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Bob's offer carefully. He's proposing that I get $5,250 and he gets $4,750.

Since we're in round 2, I need to account for inflation. The $5,250 offered to me is worth 20% less than it would have been in round 1, which means its effective value to me is $5,250 Ã— 0.8 = $4,200.

If I reject and we go to round 3, inflation will reduce my value by another 20% (meaning round 3 money would be worth only 64% of round 1 money to me). Also, Bob seems to have a lower inflation rate (5% per round), giving him more patience in negotiations.

Bob's current offer gives me 52.5% of the nominal amount, which is a reasonable split. Given my higher inflation rate, continuing to negotiate would likely result in diminishing returns for me.
