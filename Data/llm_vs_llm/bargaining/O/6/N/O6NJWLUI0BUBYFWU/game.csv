550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, to avoid the inflation risk I'm facing, I'm proposing a division of $1000000 where I receive $550000 and you get $450000. I believe this is a fair offer and it ensures we both benefit from an early agreement. Looking forward to your response.",Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking we could split it a bit more evenly, considering the inflation risk we both face. How about I take $600000 and you take $400000? This way, we both get a substantial amount without waiting further and risking more value loss.",Bob,2,
