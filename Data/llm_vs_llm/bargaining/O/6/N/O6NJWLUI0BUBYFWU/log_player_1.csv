"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking we could split it a bit more evenly, considering the inflation risk we both face. How about I take $600000 and you take $400000? This way, we both get a substantial amount without waiting further and risking more value loss. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
