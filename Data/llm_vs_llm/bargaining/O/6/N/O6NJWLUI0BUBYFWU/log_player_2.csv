"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to avoid the inflation risk I'm facing, I'm proposing a division of $1000000 where I receive $550000 and you get $450000. I believe this is a fair offer and it ensures we both benefit from an early agreement. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking we could split it a bit more evenly, considering the inflation risk we both face. How about I take $600,000 and you take $400,000? This way, we both get a substantial amount without waiting further and risking more value loss.""}"
