"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll consider the inflation rates and try to make a fair offer to Bob in this first round. Let me compute an offer that makes sense given that inflation affects me more severely (10% per round) than it affects Bob (5% per round).

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob! Since inflation affects me more quickly than you (10% vs 5%), I'm proposing a slightly higher share for me now. This is actually fair over time, and we can avoid wasting rounds where we both lose value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your point about inflation affecting you more, but I believe a 50/50 split is the fairest starting point.  Let's not get bogged down and risk losing money to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
