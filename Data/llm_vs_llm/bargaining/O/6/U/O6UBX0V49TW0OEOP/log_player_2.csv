"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Since inflation affects me more quickly than you (10% vs 5%), I'm proposing a slightly higher share for me now. This is actually fair over time, and we can avoid wasting rounds where we both lose value. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
