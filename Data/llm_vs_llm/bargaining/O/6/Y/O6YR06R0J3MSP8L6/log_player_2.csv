"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This seems like a fair split at first glance. However, I want to see if I can get a slightly better deal in the next round. The risk of losing a small amount due to inflation is worth the potential reward of a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5250 
# Alice gain: 4750 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is negotiating slightly in my favor, likely due to the inflation impacting her offer as well. Accepting this offer guarantees me a reasonable share, even considering the inflation, and avoids the risk of getting nothing if we fail to agree."
