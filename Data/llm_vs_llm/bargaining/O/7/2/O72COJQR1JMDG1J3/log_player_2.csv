"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Rationale (not part of response): I reject this highly unfair offer. While time pressure (5% inflation per round) works against me, starting with such a low offer of only 5% of the total amount leaves room for negotiation. In the next round, I can propose a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000}

Rationale (not part of message): I propose a more balanced split, but still giving Alice a slight advantage. My reasoning:
1. The 5% inflation penalty means I need to be strategic and can't drag this out too long
2. Offering Alice more than 50% makes the deal more attractive to accept
3. This is much fairer than her initial lowball offer
4. If she rejects, I'll lose 5% value in the next round, so I'm motivated to make a reasonable offer now"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Rationale (not part of response): While Alice has improved her offer from $50,000 to $200,000, it's still quite unfair. Even with the 9.75% inflation penalty (meaning my $200,000 would be worth about $180,500), there's still room for a better deal. The next round will have a 14.75% inflation penalty, so I need to be careful, but I believe I can still negotiate for a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000}

Rationale (not part of message): I'm adjusting my strategy because:
1. The inflation penalty is now significant (14.75% next round if this is rejected)
2. I'm reducing my ask from the previous 450k to show willingness to compromise
3. A 40-60 split, while not ideal, is much better than Alice's last 20-80 offer
4. If Alice rejects this, my next receivable amount would be significantly devalued
5. This offer gives Alice a clear majority while still being reasonable for me

I'm hoping Alice recognizes this as a fair compromise that's better to accept now than continue negotiating while my value keeps decreasing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Rationale (not part of response): I will accept this offer because:
1. My 250,000 with 18.55% inflation is worth about 203,875
2. If I reject and make another offer, even if I ask for more, the next round will have a 23.55% inflation penalty
3. Alice has shown she's willing to incrementally improve her offers (from 50k to 200k to 250k)
4. The negotiation pattern suggests Alice will likely continue to be firm, and my bargaining power decreases each round due to inflation
5. Further negotiations might result in even less real value for me due to mounting inflation penalties"
