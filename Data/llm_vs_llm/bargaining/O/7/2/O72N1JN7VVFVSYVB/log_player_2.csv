"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4737 
# Alice gain: 5263 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. Alice has offered me $4,737 out of the $10,000, which is about 47.4% of the total amount. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but due to 20% inflation for me, the total value would only be worth $8,000 to me. 

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, I would need to get at least $5,921.25 ($4,737 divided by 0.8) to break even with the current offer's value. That would leave only $4,078.75 for Alice, which she might reject.

Since the current offer gives me a reasonable portion and avoids the inflation penalty, I'll accept it.
