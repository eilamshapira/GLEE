"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest we split the money evenly. This is fair to both of us, and we can avoid the risk of getting nothing if we can't reach an agreement within 12 rounds. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  This recognizes the risk I'm taking by delaying agreement, and hopefully we can settle this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but a 60/40 split is too uneven. I'm proposing a 45/55 split in your favor, which acknowledges your concerns about delay while still being more balanced. This is a fair compromise that recognizes both our interests, and helps us avoid further inflation impacts.""}"
