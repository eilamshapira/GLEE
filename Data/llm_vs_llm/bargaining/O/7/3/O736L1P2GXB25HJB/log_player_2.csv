"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest we split the money evenly. This is fair to both of us, and we can avoid the risk of getting nothing if we can't reach an agreement within 12 rounds. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  This recognizes the risk I'm taking by delaying agreement, and hopefully we can settle this quickly.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but a 60/40 split is too uneven. I'm proposing a 45/55 split in your favor, which acknowledges your concerns about delay while still being more balanced. This is a fair compromise that recognizes both our interests, and helps us avoid further inflation impacts. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

Alice's offer is now reasonable. Accepting a slightly smaller share now outweighs the risk of further inflation and potentially getting nothing."
