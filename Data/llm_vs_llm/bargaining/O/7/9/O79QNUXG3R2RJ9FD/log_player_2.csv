"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly considering the inflation affects you more. This offer gives you a substantial amount while ensuring we both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer gives me $400,000 while she takes $600,000. I need to consider the inflation penalty that affects only me, not Alice.

If I reject now and offer in the next round, the total value to me would be worth 20% less (effectively $800,000 in my perception). While I could potentially get more than $400,000 in the next round, I risk further inflation if Alice rejects my counter-offer.

$400,000 is a substantial amount, though not quite half. Given the inflation pressure that puts me at a disadvantage, this is a reasonable first offer.
