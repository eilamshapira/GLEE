"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my offer to divide the $10,000. 

Since inflation doesn't affect me but reduces the value of money for Bob by 20% each round, I should consider that Bob might prefer getting some money now rather than waiting. However, I also want to be fair.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split because it's fair and should be acceptable to Bob. If Bob rejects this offer, the total value will decrease for him in the next round due to inflation, which gives him an incentive to accept now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new offer that considers the inflation effects more carefully.

Since we're now in round 3, if Bob rejects this offer, he'll face another 20% inflation in the next round. The money is still worth the full value to me, but for Bob, it's now worth only 80% of the original value in round 1 (and will be worth only 60% in round 4 if we continue).

Given this asymmetry, I can adjust my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000}

This offer gives Bob $4000, which is worth more to him now than waiting for a potentially larger amount in the future that would be significantly devalued by inflation. Since I'm not affected by inflation, I can strategically ask for a larger share while still making it rational for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more strategic offer considering the increasing inflation pressure on Bob.

We're now in round 5. If Bob rejects this offer, in the next round the money will be worth only about 40% of its original value to him (after another 20% decrease from the current value). This gives me significant leverage in negotiations.

{""alice_gain"": 7500, 
""bob_gain"": 2500}

This offer gives Bob $2500 now, which, given the significant inflation he faces, should be more valuable to him than waiting for a potentially larger but significantly devalued amount in future rounds. Since I don't face any inflation, I can strategically ask for a larger portion while still making it rational for Bob to accept rather than continuing to future rounds where his purchasing power will diminish further."
