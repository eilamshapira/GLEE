"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice has offered a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
2. However, if I reject, I can make my own offer in the next round
3. But due to 10% inflation, the money will be worth less to me in the next round
4. If I reject, the $500,000 I could get now would be equivalent to $550,000 in the next round just to break even
5. It's unlikely I could negotiate a significantly better deal that would overcome the inflation penalty

Given the inflation risk and the fairness of the initial offer, I should accept.
