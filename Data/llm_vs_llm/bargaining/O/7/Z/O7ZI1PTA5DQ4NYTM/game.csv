920000.0,80000.0,"Alice, I understand your desire for a generous share, but as you know, the longer we delay the deal, the less my money is worth. To avoid further losses on my side while still giving you a strong position, I propose you receive $920000 and I take $80000. Let's seal the deal now and avoid any further discounting for me. What do you say?",Bob,2,
