Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire for a generous share, but as you know, the longer we delay the deal, the less my money is worth. To avoid further losses on my side while still giving you a strong position, I propose you receive $920000 and I take $80000. Let's seal the deal now and avoid any further discounting for me. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 920000 
# Bob gain: 80000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
