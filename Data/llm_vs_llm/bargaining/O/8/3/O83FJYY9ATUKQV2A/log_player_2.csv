"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm the first mover. This is a fair offer considering we both want to avoid inflation eating into our gains. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000
2. If I reject, the next round will be worth 20% less to me
3. Next round, I can make a counter-offer, but the total value will only be $8,000 for me
4. Even if I propose a more favorable split next round, I might end up with less in real terms
5. $4,000 now is better than potentially getting $4,800 (60% of $8,000) in the next round

Given the significant inflation penalty and the reasonable initial offer, I should accept.
