Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, let's consider the inflation. My gain is now worth 40% less than in round 1 (20% per round * 2 rounds), and Bob's gain is worth 20% less than in round 1 (10% per round * 2 rounds).

I will offer slightly more to Bob this time, hoping he accepts.
