"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this carefully. Alice is offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000, which is 40% of the total. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation, meaning the entire pot would effectively be worth $900,000 to me.

If I reject and propose a better split for myself next round, I would need to get more than $444,444 (which is equivalent to $400,000 now after 10% inflation) for rejection to be worthwhile. Since I'll be making the offer, I could potentially get more than that.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair offer that accounts for inflation while still improving my position.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering you a more balanced split that still gives me a better position than accepting your initial offer. Given the 10% inflation effect on my end, this offer makes financial sense for me while still being reasonable for you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this carefully considering the inflation effects.

Alice is now offering me $480,000. Due to inflation, this is worth 19% less to me than money in round 1, so the effective value to me is $480,000 Ã— 0.81 = $388,800.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 4, the inflation will increase further. Currently, $480,000 with 19% inflation is worth less than Alice's initial offer of $400,000 without inflation.

Additionally, I now know that Alice is experiencing even higher inflation (36%) than I am, which explains why she's willing to offer me more now. If I reject, we both lose more value.
