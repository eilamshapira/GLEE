Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50-50 split is the fairest division. This way we both get an equal share of the money. Since inflation doesn't affect me, I'm comfortable continuing to negotiate, but I believe this is a fair offer that works for both of us.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, since inflation is affecting your gains but not mine, waiting longer is costly for you but not for me. I'm offering you 45% of the money, which is fair considering the inflation asymmetry. This is a reasonable compromise that acknowledges both our positions.

# Bob gain: 55
