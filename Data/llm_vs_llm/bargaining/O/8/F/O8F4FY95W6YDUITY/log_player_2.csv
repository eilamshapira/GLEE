"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I'm offering you 40%. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether Alice's offer of 40% (40$ for me, 60$ for her) is fair given the constraints of the game.

While a 50-50 split might be considered the fairest division, there are a few considerations:
1. If I reject, I'll get to make an offer next round
2. There's no inflation for me, so waiting doesn't cost me anything
3. I don't know how inflation affects Alice, which could give me leverage

Since there's no cost to me for waiting, and I could potentially make a better offer next round, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Now that I have the opportunity to make an offer, I'll propose a more balanced split that's still reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""I think a 50-50 split is the fairest division. This way we both get an equal share of the money. Since inflation doesn't affect me, I'm comfortable continuing to negotiate, but I believe this is a fair offer that works for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money! I'll take a slight hit and offer you 45. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer in round 3.

Alice has increased her offer to me from 40$ to 45$, which is an improvement. I notice that inflation is affecting Alice (her money is worth 9.75% less than in round 1), but not affecting me. This gives me some negotiating advantage as the game continues.

However, Alice is still asking for more than half (55$), while a 50-50 split would be 50$ each. Since there's no cost to me for continuing to negotiate (no inflation on my side), and I could make another offer in the next round, I'll reject this offer and see if we can reach a more favorable division.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Alice, since inflation is affecting your gains but not mine, waiting longer is costly for you but not for me. I'm offering you 45% of the money, which is fair considering the inflation asymmetry. This is a reasonable compromise that acknowledges both our positions.""}"
