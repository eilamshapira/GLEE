Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose a deal that reflects the cost of delay for both of us. Since waiting further depreciates the value—5% for me and 10% for you—this split (6900 for me and 3100 for you) is fair given our respective discount rates. I believe agreeing now serves both our interests.

# Bob's message: Alice, as the rounds progress your share loses 10% per round while mine loses only 5%. Accepting now means you secure 3200, which—when adjusted for today's value—is considerably better than risking further losses in future rounds. I propose we settle now with these numbers to avoid further depreciation for both of us.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, as we move into round 6 the depreciation is biting hard—my funds are now worth only about 77.4% of their face value while yours are down to roughly 59.0%. Waiting another round would drop your effective value even further. With my offer, you'll secure 5400 nominal (around 3189 in present value for you) compared to a riskier future outcome. Let's avoid further losses and settle now. 
# Alice gain: 5400 
# Bob gain: 4600
