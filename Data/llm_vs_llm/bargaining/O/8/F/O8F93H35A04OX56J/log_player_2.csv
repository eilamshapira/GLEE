Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6900, ""alice_gain"": 3100, ""message"": ""Alice, I propose a deal that reflects the cost of delay for both of us. Since waiting further depreciates the value—5% for me and 10% for you—this split (6900 for me and 3100 for you) is fair given our respective discount rates. I believe agreeing now serves both our interests.""}"

Waiting another round would drop your effective value even further. With my offer, you'll secure 5400 nominal (around 3189 in present value for you) compared to a riskier future outcome. Let's avoid further losses and settle now.""}"
