"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000 (40% of the total)
2. While this isn't a 50-50 split, it's still a substantial amount
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but:
   - I don't know how the inflation affects Alice
   - A negotiation could lead to a worse outcome if we can't agree

Given that there's no inflation penalty for me and I'm being offered a significant sum, while this isn't the most favorable split, it's reasonable enough that the risk of rejection might not be worth it.

However, I believe I can negotiate for a better deal, and since there's no inflation penalty for me, I'll try for a more equitable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer, but still slightly in my favor since I know I'm not affected by inflation:

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I propose a 55-45 split, which is more equitable than Alice's initial offer while still giving me a slight advantage. This is a reasonable middle ground that should be acceptable to Alice, as it's not too far from a fair 50-50 split."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice's new offer is slightly better than her first offer ($4,200 vs $4,000 for me)
2. Due to inflation, Alice's $5,800 is actually worth 9.75% less to her than in round 1
   - $5,800 * (1 - 0.0975) = $5,234.50 in round 1 value for her
3. My $4,200 maintains its full value since I'm not affected by inflation
4. If I reject, the next round will have even higher inflation for Alice
5. Alice seems to be moving towards a more balanced offer

While I could reject and try for more, the offer is improving, and Alice is clearly feeling pressure from inflation. This seems like a reasonable compromise given the circumstances.
