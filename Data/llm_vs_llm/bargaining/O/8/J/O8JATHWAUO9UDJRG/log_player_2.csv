"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I think 60/40 is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering a 60/40 split in her favor, which means I would get $40 while she gets $60.

Since there's no inflation for me (0% less with each passing round), I don't lose any value by rejecting and making a counter-offer. I should try to negotiate for a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""I think we should split the money equally at 50/50. This is fair for both of us, and we can both walk away satisfied with a good amount. What do you say?""}"
