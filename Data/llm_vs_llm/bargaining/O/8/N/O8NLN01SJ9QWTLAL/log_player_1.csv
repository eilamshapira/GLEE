"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I need to make a strategic offer in this game. Given that with each passing round, the money is worth 10% less for me but not for Bob, time is more costly for me. This means I should aim for a fair deal that Bob would accept now.

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a generous $450,000 (45%) which is fair considering we both deserve a substantial amount. If we go to the next round, my money loses 10% value while yours doesn't, so this deal benefits both of us now rather than prolonging negotiations.""}"
