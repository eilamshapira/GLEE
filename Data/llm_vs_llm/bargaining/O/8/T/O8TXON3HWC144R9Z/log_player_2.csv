"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me 4000$ out of 10,000$
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 10% inflation, any amount I get next round will be worth 10% less to me
4. If I get 4000$ now, it's better than getting 4500$ next round (which would be worth 4050$ to me due to inflation)
5. While I could try to negotiate for more, the risk of continued inflation and potential deadlock makes this a reasonable offer
