6000.0,4000.0,Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split reflects a fair division for both of us.,Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, I understand the importance of a fair and timely agreement. Given that each extra round reduces my share's value due to inflation, I'm proposing a 55%-45% split in my favor. Accepting now ensures we both secure significant amounts without further devaluation. What do you say?",Bob,2,

5700.0,4300.0,"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a middle ground. I'm proposing a split of 57/43, which is a fair adjustment considering the time pressure and the fact that we're losing value with each round.",Alice,3,

5800.0,4200.0,"Alice, I understand that you value securing a full, undiminished sum, and I’m aware that any delay only hurts my effective share further. To reach a prompt resolution that respects your strong position while acknowledging our current time pressure, I’m offering you $5800 and taking $4200 myself. This way you receive slightly more than your previous target, and we both avoid the risks of further negotiation rounds. I hope this fair compromise meets your expectations.",Bob,4,
