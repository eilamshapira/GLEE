Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the importance of a fair and timely agreement. Given that each extra round reduces my share's value due to inflation, I'm proposing a 55%-45% split in my favor. Accepting now ensures we both secure significant amounts without further devaluation. What do you say?

# Bob gain: 5500

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you value securing a full, undiminished sum, and I’m aware that any delay only hurts my effective share further. To reach a prompt resolution that respects your strong position while acknowledging our current time pressure, I’m offering you $5800 and taking $4200 myself. This way you receive slightly more than your previous target, and we both avoid the risks of further negotiation rounds. I hope this fair compromise meets your expectations. 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200
