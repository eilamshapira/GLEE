Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand the importance of a fair and timely agreement. Given that each extra round reduces my share's value due to inflation, I'm proposing a 55%-45% split in my favor. Accepting now ensures we both secure significant amounts without further devaluation. What do you say?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a middle ground. I'm proposing a split of 57/43, which is a fair adjustment considering the time pressure and the fact that we're losing value with each round. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4200, ""alice_gain"": 5800, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand that you value securing a full, undiminished sum, and I’m aware that any delay only hurts my effective share further. To reach a prompt resolution that respects your strong position while acknowledging our current time pressure, I’m offering you $5800 and taking $4200 myself. This way you receive slightly more than your previous target, and we both avoid the risks of further negotiation rounds. I hope this fair compromise meets your expectations.""}"
