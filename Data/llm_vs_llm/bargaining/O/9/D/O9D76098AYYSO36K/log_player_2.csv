"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. This gives us both an equal share, which seems like the most fair approach. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to think about Alice's offer carefully considering the inflation effect.

Alice has offered a 50-50 split ($5,000 each). This seems fair at first glance.

However, I need to consider that with each passing round, the money is worth 10% less to me. If I reject now and propose in the next round, the total value to me would be $9,000 (10% less than $10,000). Even if I get more than $5,000 in the next round, I need to account for this inflation.

A 50-50 split in round 1 gives me $5,000 at full value. This is a reasonable offer considering the inflation penalty I face for waiting.
