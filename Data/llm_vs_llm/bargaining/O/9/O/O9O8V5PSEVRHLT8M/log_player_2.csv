"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Let's see if Alice can do better than a 0% advantage. I can do better than a 50/50 split, even with the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

Considering the 10% inflation per round, this offer essentially gives Alice a bit more than what she offered me in the first round. Let's see if she understands the impact of inflation on my share."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Even with the inflation, I can still do better than this. Let's see if Alice can offer something more reasonable in the next round. I am in no rush."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5400, ""alice_gain"": 4600}

This offer gives Alice exactly what she offered me in the previous round if we don't consider the inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Even though the inflation has reduced the value of the money for me, accepting this offer still gives me more value than what Alice is willing to offer in future rounds. If I were to reject all future offers, the value of my share would decrease to 0. So, it's better to secure this amount now."
