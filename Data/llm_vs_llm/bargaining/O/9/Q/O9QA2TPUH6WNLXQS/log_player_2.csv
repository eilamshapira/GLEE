"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","While an even split seems fair at first glance, I need to consider the impact of inflation. If I reject and propose in the next round, the total will be worth 5% less to me, making the pot worth 9,500$ from my perspective. 

Given the uncertainty about how inflation affects Alice and the risk of getting nothing if we don't reach agreement within 12 rounds, I'll accept this fair initial offer.
