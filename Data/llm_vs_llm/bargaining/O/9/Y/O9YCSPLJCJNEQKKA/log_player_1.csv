"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","For the first round, I'll make a reasonable offer. Since I don't know how the inflation affects Bob, I'll start with a fair split to encourage acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $400,000, which is worth 5% less than its original value, so I'll effectively get 400,000 * 0.95 = $380,000.

If I reject this offer, the money will be worth even less in the next round. Since Bob's offer gives him a larger share, I expect him to be more willing to accept a deal that favors him. Given the decreasing value of the money, I'll accept this offer to secure some value.
