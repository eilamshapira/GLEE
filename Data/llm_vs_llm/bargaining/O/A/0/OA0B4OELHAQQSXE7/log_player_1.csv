Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 425000 
# Bob gain: 575000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

I'll explain my reasoning:

* **Inflation:**  The money is losing value for me quickly.  Accepting a bad deal now is only slightly better than getting nothing in Round 12.
* **Bob's Strategy:** Bob seems to be pushing for a higher gain. His offer is slowly improving, but it's still heavily skewed in his favor.  Rejecting might push him to offer more. 

It's a gamble, but waiting a bit longer might force a more favorable outcome for me."

""alice_gain"": 525000,

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation is hitting you hard, I think this is a reasonable offer. We're running out of time. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is a tough one, but I have to reject it. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** While Bob is right about time running out, accepting this offer means I lose a significant amount to both him and inflation.
* **Hope for Better:**  There's still a chance Bob will panic as we get closer to the deadline and offer a more favorable split. 
* **Holding Out:**  Even a slightly better offer in the next couple of rounds would be better than accepting this deal.

It's risky, but I'm hoping Bob understands the urgency and that getting something is better than nothing."
