"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's agree on this fair and strategic split so we both benefit without much loss. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. This is the first round, so there's no inflation yet.
2. Alice is offering me $3,500, keeping $6,500 for herself.
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but:
   - The money will be worth 10% less to me
   - Alice faces no inflation penalty
   - Alice could still reject my offer

$3,500 now is better than potentially getting more that's worth less due to inflation. However, this split is quite uneven (35/65), and since it's the first round, I can afford to negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split, considering that Alice has no inflation penalty but I do:

{""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""This is a more balanced split that acknowledges your inflation advantage while being fair to both of us. If you reject, we'll both lose value in future rounds.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this offer ensures we both walk away with a good share. Let's finalize this deal now. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Due to 19% inflation for me, $4,000 is actually worth $3,240 in round 1 value
2. Alice's previous offer was $3,500 (with no inflation)
3. If I reject:
   - Next round will have 27.1% inflation for me
   - My negotiating position weakens with each round
   - Alice still faces no inflation

While the nominal amount ($4,000) is higher than Alice's first offer ($3,500), due to inflation, I'm actually getting less real value ($3,240 vs $3,500). However, my position will only get worse in future rounds, and Alice knows this.
