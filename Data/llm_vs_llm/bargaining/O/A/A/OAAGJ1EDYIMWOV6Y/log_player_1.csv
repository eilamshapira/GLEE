"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split while accounting for the fact that Bob might want to counter-offer, but that would result in a 5% loss of value.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}

I propose I get $5,200 and Bob gets $4,800. This is close to a 50-50 split but slightly in my favor since I'm making the first move. It's fair enough that Bob should accept rather than risk the 5% value loss in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While it's slightly less favorable to me than my initial proposal, the 5% inflation means that continuing to negotiate would result in both of us losing value. This is a reasonable split, close to 50-50, and accepting now is better than risking further depreciation of the total amount."
