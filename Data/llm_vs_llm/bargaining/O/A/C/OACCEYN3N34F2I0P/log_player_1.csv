"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a slightly favorable split for me since Bob has no time pressure (no inflation for him), but still fair enough that he should accept:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split because I want to acknowledge the time pressure I'm under while still keeping things relatively fair. Bob can still get a good amount, and waiting would mean I lose value due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because even with the 20% inflation penalty, I'll get $4,500 * 0.8 = $3,600 in effective value. If I reject and we continue to the next round, any amount I could get would be worth even less due to additional inflation, making it harder to negotiate a better outcome for myself. This is a reasonable compromise given the circumstances."
