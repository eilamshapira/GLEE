"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let me propose a fair split while considering the inflation risk.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose this split because if Bob rejects it, in the next round the $100 will be worth only $90 to me due to inflation. By offering Bob a reasonable $45, I hope they'll accept rather than risk negotiating further when both of us could lose value."
