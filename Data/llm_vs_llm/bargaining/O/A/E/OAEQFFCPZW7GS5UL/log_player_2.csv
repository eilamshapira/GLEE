"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
- She's offering me $45 out of $100
- While slightly in her favor, it's close to a 50-50 split
- There's no inflation penalty affecting my gains
- If I reject, I get to make the next offer, but there's no guarantee Alice will accept
- $45 is a reasonable amount that avoids the risk of further negotiation

Based on this analysis, I'll accept the offer since it's fairly reasonable and avoids any risk.
