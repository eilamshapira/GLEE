"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I'll make the first offer. Considering the inflation, I want to secure as much as possible in the first round.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this offer.

*   **My Perspective (Alice):**  My $10,000 is now worth 10% less due to inflation.

    *   Original value: $10,000
    *   Round 2 Value: $10,000 * 0.90 = $9,000 (This is the real value of money for me)
    *   Offer: I get $5,000, which is about half of the original value.
*   **Bob's Perspective:** Bob's share remains the same as original value.

Given that I'm at a disadvantage, I should accept the offer as I am getting half of the value.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
