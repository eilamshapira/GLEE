"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer carefully. While I would receive $1000, which is better than nothing if we can't reach an agreement within 12 rounds, it represents only 10% of the total amount. Since there's no inflation for me, I don't lose value by continuing to negotiate, and I have many rounds remaining to potentially secure a more equitable distribution.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more equitable distribution while acknowledging that Alice made the first move.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I propose an even 50-50 split, which would give us both $5,000. This is a fair division that maximizes our collective welfare."
