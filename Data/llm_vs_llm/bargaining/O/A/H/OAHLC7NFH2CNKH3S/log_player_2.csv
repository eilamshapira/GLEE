"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 8312.93 
# Alice gain: 1687.07 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $8,312.93 (about 83% of the total)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but:
   - The money will be worth 5% less to me
   - The money will be worth 20% less to Alice
3. Currently being offered 83% of the total is quite generous
4. Even with inflation, it would be hard to get a significantly better deal

Given that this is a very favorable split already, and considering the risk of value depreciation in future rounds, I should accept this offer.
