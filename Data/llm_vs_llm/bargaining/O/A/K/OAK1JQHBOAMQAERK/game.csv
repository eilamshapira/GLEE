600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering the different inflation rates we face - you only lose 5% per round while I lose 20%. If we go to another round, the total value decreases more for me than for you, which gives you leverage. This offer respects that dynamic while still being advantageous for both of us.",Alice,1,

550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your point about the inflation rates. However, a 60-40 split feels too uneven for me to accept right away. I'm proposing a 55-45 split in your favor. This still acknowledges the inflation difference while giving me a better share. What do you think?",Bob,2,
