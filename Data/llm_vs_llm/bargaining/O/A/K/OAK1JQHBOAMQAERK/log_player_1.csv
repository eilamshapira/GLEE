"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll consider the inflation rates and make an offer to Bob that takes into account our different discount factors.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering the different inflation rates we face - you only lose 5% per round while I lose 20%. If we go to another round, the total value decreases more for me than for you, which gives you leverage. This offer respects that dynamic while still being advantageous for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your point about the inflation rates. However, a 60-40 split feels too uneven for me to accept right away. I'm proposing a 55-45 split in your favor. This still acknowledges the inflation difference while giving me a better share. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
