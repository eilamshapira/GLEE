"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering the different inflation rates we face - you only lose 5% per round while I lose 20%. If we go to another round, the total value decreases more for me than for you, which gives you leverage. This offer respects that dynamic while still being advantageous for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000
