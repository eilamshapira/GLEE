500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose an equal division of the $1000000 – you get $500000 and I get $500000. I believe this fair split benefits us both right from the start. Please let me know if you accept this offer so we can both secure our share without delay.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Hi Alice, let's speed things up. I propose I take $600000 and you get $400000.  This gives you a sizable sum upfront, and avoids further losses due to inflation for both of us.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
120000.0,880000.0,"Hi Bob, here's my counteroffer for round 3. Since each new round further depreciates your share — with your funds now effectively worth 80% of the nominal value — waiting until round 4 could drop your effective proceeds to roughly 70% of any amount you get. In this offer, you’d receive $880000 nominally (about $704000 in effective value), while I secure $120000 (which remains at full value). I believe this deal is fair given the inflation cost on your side if we delay further. I hope you’ll agree that accepting now is in both our interests.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"Alice, let's be realistic. The longer this goes on, the more we both lose. I'm proposing $700000 for me and $300000 for you. This is a fair split considering the time pressure and inflation. Let's close this deal and avoid further losses.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
230000.0,770000.0,"Bob, I know that as rounds progress your nominal dollars lose more of their value. In this round, your funds are roughly worth 66% of their face value. My offer gives you $770000 (around $508200 in effective terms), which is nearly what you’d get if you held out for your own proposal—but without risking further devaluation. I receive $230000 in full value. Accepting now allows us both to avoid the additional losses tied to waiting. I hope you'll agree that this is our best move.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"Alice, I acknowledge your point about the inflation affecting my share, but I need a bit more on my side.  I'm proposing $650000 for me and $350000 for you. This keeps a reasonable balance while acknowledging the time pressure we both face.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
211538.0,788462.0,"Hi Bob, as we move into later rounds the inflation will further erode the effective value of any money you receive—by round 8 your funds could be worth only about 45% of their nominal value. Accepting my offer in round 7 means you’d receive $788462 nominally, which at an estimated 52% effective value comes to roughly $410000 in today’s terms. I keep $211538 at full value. This offer is designed to give you a significantly better effective return now than if you waited further. I hope you’ll agree it’s in both our best interests to settle today.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
375000.0,625000.0,"Alice, we're getting close to the wire here. Let's find a compromise. I'm proposing $625000 for me and $375000 for you. This gives us both a decent share, even considering the inflation.",Bob,8,
