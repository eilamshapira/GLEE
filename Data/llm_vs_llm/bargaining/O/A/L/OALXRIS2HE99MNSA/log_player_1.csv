Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's speed things up. I propose I take $600000 and you get $400000.  This gives you a sizable sum upfront, and avoids further losses due to inflation for both of us.

# Bob gain: 600000

Since each new round further depreciates your share — with your funds now effectively worth 80% of the nominal value — waiting until round 4 could drop your effective proceeds to roughly 70% of any amount you get. In this offer, you’d receive $880,000 nominally (about $704,000 in effective value), while I secure $120,000 (which remains at full value). I believe this deal is fair given the inflation cost on your side if we delay further. I hope you’ll agree that accepting now is in both our interests.""}"

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic. The longer this goes on, the more we both lose. I'm proposing $700000 for me and $300000 for you. This is a fair split considering the time pressure and inflation. Let's close this deal and avoid further losses.

I receive $230,000 in full value. Accepting now allows us both to avoid the additional losses tied to waiting. I hope you'll agree that this is our best move.""}"

This offer is designed to give you a significantly better effective return now than if you waited further. I hope you’ll agree it’s in both our best interests to settle today.""}"
