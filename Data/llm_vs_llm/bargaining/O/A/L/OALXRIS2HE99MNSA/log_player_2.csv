Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose an equal division of the $1000000 – you get $500000 and I get $500000. I believe this fair split benefits us both right from the start. Please let me know if you accept this offer so we can both secure our share without delay.

Round 2

""alice_gain"": 400000,

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my counteroffer for round 3. Since each new round further depreciates your share — with your funds now effectively worth 80% of the nominal value — waiting until round 4 could drop your effective proceeds to roughly 70% of any amount you get. In this offer, you’d receive $880000 nominally (about $704000 in effective value), while I secure $120000 (which remains at full value). I believe this deal is fair given the inflation cost on your side if we delay further. I hope you’ll agree that accepting now is in both our interests. 
# Bob gain: 880000 
# Alice gain: 120000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is clearly trying to use the inflation against me, but her offer is far too low. I need to push for a better split, even with the inflation penalty."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. The longer this goes on, the more we both lose. I'm proposing $700,000 for me and $300,000 for you. This is a fair split considering the time pressure and inflation. Let's close this deal and avoid further losses.""

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I know that as rounds progress your nominal dollars lose more of their value. In this round, your funds are roughly worth 66% of their face value. My offer gives you $770000 (around $508200 in effective terms), which is nearly what you’d get if you held out for your own proposal—but without risking further devaluation. I receive $230000 in full value. Accepting now allows us both to avoid the additional losses tied to waiting. I hope you'll agree that this is our best move. 
# Bob gain: 770000 
# Alice gain: 230000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is getting closer to a reasonable split, but I believe I can still push for a slightly better deal. Accepting now would mean losing a significant chunk of the potential gain due to inflation.  It's a risk, but I have to try."

""message"": ""Alice, I acknowledge your point about the inflation affecting my share, but I need a bit more on my side.  I'm proposing $650,000 for me and $350,000 for you. This keeps a reasonable balance while acknowledging the time pressure we both face.""

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, as we move into later rounds the inflation will further erode the effective value of any money you receive—by round 8 your funds could be worth only about 45% of their nominal value. Accepting my offer in round 7 means you’d receive $788462 nominally, which at an estimated 52% effective value comes to roughly $410000 in today’s terms. I keep $211538 at full value. This offer is designed to give you a significantly better effective return now than if you waited further. I hope you’ll agree it’s in both our best interests to settle today. 
# Bob gain: 788462 
# Alice gain: 211538 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is a tough one. Alice's offer is tempting considering the inflation, but it's still below my target. I'm willing to gamble a bit more, hoping she'll become more agreeable as we get closer to the deadline."
