"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. It's round 1, I'm Alice, and I need to make an offer to Bob, keeping in mind the decreasing value of the money for both of us as the rounds progress.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

My proposal is a 60/40 split. I'm hoping this is acceptable to Bob, considering the early stage of the game and the potential for the money to lose value for him more rapidly than it does for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob rejected my initial offer and has now proposed a split of $5500 for me and $4500 for him. Since the money's value hasn't diminished for me yet, and this is still a decent amount, I will accept.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
