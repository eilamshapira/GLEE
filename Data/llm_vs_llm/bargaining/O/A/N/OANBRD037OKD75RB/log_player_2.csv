"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a fairly even split, with a slightly larger portion for me as the first mover. This way we both walk away with a substantial amount. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's offer carefully.

Alice is proposing I receive $450,000 while she gets $550,000. She's justifying her larger share by being the first mover. While this isn't a perfect 50-50 split, it's a reasonable offer that would give me a substantial amount without needing to continue the negotiation. 

If I reject, I could propose a more favorable split in the next round, but Alice might reject that as well, leading to further rounds of negotiation with the risk of eventually getting nothing if we can't agree.

Given that $450,000 is a significant amount and we're just in the first round, I'll accept this offer.
