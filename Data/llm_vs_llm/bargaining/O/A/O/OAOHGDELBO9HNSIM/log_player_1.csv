"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","For my first offer, I'll propose a division that recognizes we both need to come to an agreement while considering the inflation factor.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering you $4,500, Bob, which is slightly less than half. Since money loses 5% value for you each round but not for me, it makes sense for you to accept a reasonable offer early. This is a fair division that gives us both a substantial amount."
