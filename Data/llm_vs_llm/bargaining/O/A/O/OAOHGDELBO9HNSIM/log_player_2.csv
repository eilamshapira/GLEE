"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $4,500 out of $10,000
2. If I reject, we move to round 2, where:
   * I can make a counter-proposal
   * My share will be worth 5% less ($4,500 * 0.95 = $4,275 if I got the same amount)
3. Alice's opening offer is somewhat unfavorable (45/55 split)
4. However, the inflation penalty means I risk losing value by negotiating too long

While the offer isn't perfectly fair (50/50), it's reasonably close, and the risk of losing value through inflation makes accepting this decent offer more attractive than negotiating for a potentially small improvement.
