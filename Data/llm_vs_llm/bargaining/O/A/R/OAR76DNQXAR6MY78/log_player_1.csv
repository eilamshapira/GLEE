Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand we both want a fair deal. Due to the 20% inflation penalty I face each round, this offer gives us both a substantial amount while recognizing the time pressure. If we continue negotiating, my buying power decreases significantly, so I hope you'll find this reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
