"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer ensures you get a good chunk while recognizing the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Looking at Alice's offer, I need to consider the value of accepting now versus making a counter-offer.

Alice is offering me $300,000 out of $1,000,000.

If I reject and we move to round 2, the money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation, meaning the whole $1,000,000 will effectively be worth $800,000 to me. However, I would then make the next offer.

Given that I can make a better counter-offer and that even with the 20% inflation penalty I could potentially get more than $300,000, I'll reject this initial offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that acknowledges the inflation pressure I face while still being fair enough that Alice might accept it.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I understand we both want a fair deal. Due to the 20% inflation penalty I face each round, this offer gives us both a substantial amount while recognizing the time pressure. If we continue negotiating, my buying power decreases significantly, so I hope you'll find this reasonable.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out for both of us, but especially for you. I'm offering a deal that still gives you a significant sum. Let's close this and avoid losing more to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate this offer considering the increasing inflation penalty I face.

Alice is now offering me $350,000 out of $1,000,000.

With the 36% inflation penalty in round 3, this $350,000 is effectively worth $224,000 to me (350,000 Ã— 0.64).

If I reject and we move to round 4, the money will be worth 48.8% less to me (1 - 0.8^3), meaning the whole $1,000,000 would effectively be worth only $512,000 to me. Even if I made a very favorable offer in round 4, I'd need to get significantly more than $350,000 to offset this penalty.

Given the increasing inflation pressure and the improved offer from Alice, I'll accept this deal.
