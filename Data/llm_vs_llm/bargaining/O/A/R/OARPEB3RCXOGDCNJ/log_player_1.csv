"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer to Bob that considers the inflation I'm facing.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, considering that if we move to additional rounds, the money will be worth less to me due to the 10% inflation penalty I face per round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'm getting less than my initial proposal (45 instead of 60), the 10% inflation penalty means that if I reject and we go to another round, the money will be worth even less to me. Additionally, knowing that Bob faces an even steeper inflation penalty (20% per round) explains why he's trying to conclude the negotiation now. This seems like a reasonable compromise given our respective inflation situations."
