"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob.  Fair is fair! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation. That means the $100 would only be worth $90 to me in the next round.

With Alice's current offer of $50, I would get $50 now. If I wait for the next round, even if I managed to get a larger share, I would need to get more than $55.56 of the $90-equivalent to beat the current offer of $50.

Given the fair initial offer and the risk of inflation, I should accept this proposal.
