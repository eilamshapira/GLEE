Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each round, I'll try to make a fair offer. Considering the inflation, I'll propose a division that's slightly in my favor to account for the decreasing value.

""alice_gain"": 450000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $420,000 I would gain is actually worth about 64% of its original value, which is approximately $268,800 in round 1 terms ($420,000 * 0.64). 

Given this, I think Alice's offer is still not in my favor, but the inflation is starting to hurt. I'll reject this offer and try to make a better proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The money is worth 20% less for me in each round, and it's already worth 36% less than in the first round, which means it's now worth 48.4% less after two rounds of inflation (1 - 0.8 * 0.8). However, considering only my perspective, after 3 rounds of inflation (1 - 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8), the money I would receive is worth approximately 51% of its original value (1 - 0.488).

I'll try to make a more generous offer to Alice, hoping she'll accept it.
