Explanation: I offer Bob $40 while I keep $60. This is a reasonable starting offer that gives both of us a significant share, but it is slightly in my favor."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
