"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 46 
# Alice gain: 54 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

Even with inflation, getting $46 now is better than risking getting a worse offer in the next round. The longer the game goes on, the less favorable the outcome will be for me."
