4694.41,5305.59,"Hi Bob, here’s my first‐round proposal. I’d like to take $4694.41 and offer you $5305.59. Given that if you reject you’d propose next round—but with a 10% per round discount on your money—this deal gives you roughly what you’d expect later. I believe it’s a fair division considering the future devaluation you’d face. Let’s settle now!",Alice,1,
