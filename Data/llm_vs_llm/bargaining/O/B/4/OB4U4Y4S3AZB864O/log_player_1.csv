"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 4694.41, ""bob_gain"": 5305.59, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here’s my first‐round proposal. I’d like to take $4,694.41 and offer you $5,305.59. Given that if you reject you’d propose next round—but with a 10% per round discount on your money—this deal gives you roughly what you’d expect later. I believe it’s a fair division considering the future devaluation you’d face. Let’s settle now!""}"
