"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here’s my first‐round proposal. I’d like to take $4694.41 and offer you $5305.59. Given that if you reject you’d propose next round—but with a 10% per round discount on your money—this deal gives you roughly what you’d expect later. I believe it’s a fair division considering the future devaluation you’d face. Let’s settle now! 
# Bob gain: 5305.59 
# Alice gain: 4694.41 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $5305.59 (53.06%) and keeping $4694.41 (46.94%)
2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make an offer
   * But my money will be worth 10% less
   * $5305.59 now vs $9000 × 0.9 = $8100 maximum next round

While I could potentially get more in the next round, there's risk involved:
- Alice might reject my counter-offer
- Each subsequent round reduces my purchasing power by 10%
- After several rounds of rejection, we both might end up with nothing

Alice's offer is actually quite fair considering the time pressure and asymmetric inflation affecting only me. She's clearly thought about the game theory aspects.
