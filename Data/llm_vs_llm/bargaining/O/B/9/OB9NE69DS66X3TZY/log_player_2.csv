Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's split this fairly, a little more than half for me to make up for the first round. This way we both win big!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but let's be realistic, I should get a bigger share as I'm the one making the offers.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is getting better from my perspective, but it's still heavily skewed in Alice's favor. The inflation is hurting me, but I'm betting Alice is also feeling the pressure.  I need to hold out for a better deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is a serious offer.  We're both losing money with each round.  Take this deal and we both walk away with a good amount!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we need to make a deal. I'm getting impatient with this game. This is my final offer, and I'm sticking to it.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is a tough one. Alice is playing hardball, and this might be her final offer. However, the inflation is eating into my share rapidly.  I'm willing to gamble that she'll be more flexible in the next round rather than risk getting nothing."
