"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make my first offer to Bob. Since there's inflation to consider, I should offer a fair split that incentivizes acceptance now rather than delay.

{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40}

I suggest this split because we should both be aware of the inflation impact. If we go to another round, the total value decreases significantly for me (20% less) and somewhat for Bob (5% less). This offer gives Bob a substantial portion while acknowledging that I have a stronger incentive to finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to carefully consider the inflation effects as we enter round 3. For me, the money is now worth 40% less than in round 1 (20% loss per round), while for Bob it's only 10% less than round 1 (5% loss per round).

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm adjusting my offer to be more favorable to Bob compared to my first proposal. This acknowledges that inflation is affecting me more severely than Bob. If we continue to another round, I'll lose even more value, so it's increasingly in my interest to reach an agreement. This offer gives Bob a meaningful increase from my previous offer while still providing me with a reasonable return given the circumstances."
