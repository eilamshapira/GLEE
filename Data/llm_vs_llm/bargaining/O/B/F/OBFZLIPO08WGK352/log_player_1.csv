"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a slightly favorable split for myself since I have the first move, but still fair enough that Bob might accept to avoid inflation affecting his share.

{""alice_gain"": 5400, ""bob_gain"": 4600}

I propose $5,400 for myself and $4,600 for Bob. This is a reasonable split that acknowledges my first-mover advantage while still giving Bob a substantial portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. The offer is a 50-50 split ($5000 each)
2. Due to 5% inflation for me, my $5000 is actually worth $4750
3. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, my money will be worth even less (another 5% less)
4. Even if I could get a better split in the next round, the inflation would likely eat away at those gains

Given that this is a fair 50-50 split and further delays will definitely reduce my buying power, I should accept this offer.
