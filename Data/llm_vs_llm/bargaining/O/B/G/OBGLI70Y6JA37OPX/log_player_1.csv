"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest we split the money with me taking $6,000 and you getting $4,000. This way, we both get a good share and avoid the inflation in the next rounds. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50-50 split would be the fairest solution. That way we both get an equal share of $5000. Since there's no inflation effect for me, I'm comfortable continuing negotiations if needed, but I believe this even split is the most equitable outcome for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
