"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest we split the money with me taking $6000 and you getting $4000. This way, we both get a good share and avoid the inflation in the next rounds. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice is offering me $4000 out of the $10,000 total, which is less than half. Since the instructions mention that inflation is 0% for me (meaning the money won't lose value in future rounds), I have no incentive to accept a less-than-equal split right away.

If I reject this offer, I'll get to make a counter-proposal in the next round, and I might be able to negotiate a better deal for myself.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50-50 split would be the fairest solution. That way we both get an equal share of $5000. Since there's no inflation effect for me, I'm comfortable continuing negotiations if needed, but I believe this even split is the most equitable outcome for both of us.""}"
