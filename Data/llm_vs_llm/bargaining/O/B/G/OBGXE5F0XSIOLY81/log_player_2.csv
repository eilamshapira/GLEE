"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm proposing a fair split that favors me slightly since I have less inflation pressure (10% vs your 20%). This way we both walk away with a good amount without risking value loss in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:

1. She's offering me $450,000 and taking $550,000
2. If I reject:
   - Next round I can make an offer
   - But my money will be worth 20% less
   - Her money will be worth 10% less
   - My $450,000 now > $480,000 after 20% loss
3. She makes a valid point about having less inflation pressure
4. This is a reasonable first offer that gives me a significant amount
5. Prolonging negotiations will reduce both our gains

Given the high inflation rate I'm facing and the reasonable nature of the offer, I should accept now rather than risk further devaluation.
