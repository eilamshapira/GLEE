"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a fair split that slightly favors me as the current proposer. This is much more balanced than your initial offer. Remember, we both lose if we don't agree, and your money will be worth 5% less next round. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000
