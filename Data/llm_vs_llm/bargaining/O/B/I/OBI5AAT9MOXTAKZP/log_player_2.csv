"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my first offer, it's a fair start, I hope you will accept it. If you want to play more, you have 11 rounds left! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $100,000 (10%) while keeping $900,000 (90%)
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 10% less for me next round
3. I can make a counter-offer next round
4. This split is quite unfavorable for me

This is not a fair split at all. Even with the inflation penalty, I can make a more balanced counter-offer in the next round that would be better for both of us.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split, considering that we both face inflation penalties but need to reach an agreement:

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I propose a fair split that slightly favors me as the current proposer. This is much more balanced than your initial offer. Remember, we both lose if we don't agree, and your money will be worth 5% less next round.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still believe a more balanced split is possible.  Let's work towards a solution that benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
1. Alice is now offering me $400,000 (40%) while keeping $600,000 (60%)
2. Due to inflation, my $400,000 is actually worth $324,000 (after 19% reduction)
3. Alice's $600,000 is worth $541,500 (after 9.75% reduction)
4. This is a significant improvement from the first offer
5. If I reject, my money will be worth another 10% less next round
6. The split is getting more reasonable, but still could be better

However, considering:
- The increasing inflation penalty (especially higher for me)
- We've already used 3 rounds out of 12
- The offer is much more reasonable than the first one
- The risk of getting nothing if we don't agree
