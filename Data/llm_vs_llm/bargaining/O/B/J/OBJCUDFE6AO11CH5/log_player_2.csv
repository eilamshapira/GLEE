"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40, a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer considering the inflation effect if I reject it. If I reject now, the money will be worth 20% less for me in the next round. If I make a counter-offer, I'll need to propose something better than what I can get now.

Currently, Alice is offering me 400,000 out of 1,000,000 (40%). If I reject, the next round will have the same amount but it's worth 20% less to me, meaning the entire pot is effectively worth 800,000 to me.

Even if I could get 50% in the next round, that would be 500,000 of the nominal amount, but with 20% inflation, it's effectively 400,000 in today's value - the same as what Alice is offering now.

Given the inflation risk and that 40% is a reasonable share, I'll accept this offer.
