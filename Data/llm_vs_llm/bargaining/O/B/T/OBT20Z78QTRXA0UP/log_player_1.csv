"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair initial offer that considers the potential inflation effect.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

This is a fair 50-50 split of the total amount. I'm proposing we each get $5,000, which is the most equitable division. If we need to go to another round, I'll face 20% inflation on my share, so I hope this fair offer will be acceptable."
