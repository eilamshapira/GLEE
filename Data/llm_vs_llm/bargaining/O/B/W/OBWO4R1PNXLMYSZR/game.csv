5263.0,4737.0,"Hi Bob, I propose that we divide the $10000 as $5263 for me and $4737 for you. Given the 10% per-round discounting and the alternating offers framework, this split reflects the slight advantage of making the initial proposal. I believe this is fair if we both want to avoid the future devaluation. What are your thoughts?",Alice,1,
