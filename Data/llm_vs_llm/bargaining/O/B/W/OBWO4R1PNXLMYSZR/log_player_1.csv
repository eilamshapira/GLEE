"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5263, ""bob_gain"": 4737, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that we divide the $10,000 as $5,263 for me and $4,737 for you. Given the 10% per-round discounting and the alternating offers framework, this split reflects the slight advantage of making the initial proposal. I believe this is fair if we both want to avoid the future devaluation. What are your thoughts?""}"
