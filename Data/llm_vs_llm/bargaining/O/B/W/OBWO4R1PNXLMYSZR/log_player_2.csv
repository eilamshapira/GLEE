"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that we divide the $10000 as $5263 for me and $4737 for you. Given the 10% per-round discounting and the alternating offers framework, this split reflects the slight advantage of making the initial proposal. I believe this is fair if we both want to avoid the future devaluation. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob gain: 4737 
# Alice gain: 5263 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
