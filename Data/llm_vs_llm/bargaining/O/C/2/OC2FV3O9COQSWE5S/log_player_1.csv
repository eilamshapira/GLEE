"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make my offer in the first round. Given the information about inflation, I want to propose a fair division while considering that delaying would decrease the value for me.

{""alice_gain"": 50,
""bob_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""I'm proposing an equal split of $50 each. This is fair for both of us, and since inflation affects me by 20% each round, it's in my interest to settle now, and you avoid the uncertainty of future rounds.""}"
