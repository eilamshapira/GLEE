"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm proposing an equal split of $50 each. This is fair for both of us, and since inflation affects me by 20% each round, it's in my interest to settle now, and you avoid the uncertainty of future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the rules. Alice proposes $50 for me, and $50 for her. My gain is $50. Inflation affects me by 5% per round.

Let's consider the alternatives if I reject. If I reject, it's my turn to propose. Even if I propose $99 for myself and $1 for Alice, she might reject it knowing she can propose next round. The key factor here is that Alice also experiences inflation, but at a higher rate of 20% each round. Since she mentions the high inflation rate affecting her, it's believable that she wants to settle quickly.

Therefore, accepting $50 now, which is worth $50 * 0.95 = $47.50 next round if i reject and propose the round after, is a reasonable offer given the circumstances.
