"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, by accepting now you secure $4000 before further devaluation sets in. Waiting to propose next round means you'll face an 80% value multiplier later, and I risk losing more value as well. Let's seal the deal now for a fair, efficient outcome for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
