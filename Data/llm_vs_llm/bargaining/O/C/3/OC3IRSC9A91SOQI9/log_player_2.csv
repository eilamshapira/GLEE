Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Alice, by accepting now you secure $4000 before further devaluation sets in. Waiting to propose next round means you'll face an 80% value multiplier later, and I risk losing more value as well. Let's seal the deal now for a fair, efficient outcome for both of us.""}"
