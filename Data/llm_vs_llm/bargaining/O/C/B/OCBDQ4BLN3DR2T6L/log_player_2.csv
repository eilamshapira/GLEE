"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this logically:

1. Current offer: $30 for me, $70 for Alice
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
   * The money will be worth 20% less to me
   * $100 will effectively be worth $80 to me
   * Alice has no time pressure (no depreciation)
   * Alice could still reject my offer, leading to further depreciation

While $30 is not a great offer, if I reject it, I'll be negotiating with less leverage in the next round due to the 20% depreciation. Any amount I get in future rounds will be worth less to me, while Alice can afford to wait.

$30 now is better than a potentially higher nominal amount that's worth less due to depreciation.
