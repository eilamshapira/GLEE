Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand we both want to resolve this quickly. Your initial offer was quite unbalanced. I'm proposing a much fairer split where you still get the majority (55%) given your inflation advantage. This is reasonable and respects both our interests. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
