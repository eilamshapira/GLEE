"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's get this done quickly! I'm offering you a solid 10, which is more than you'll likely get if we drag this out. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is offering me $10 out of the $100, which means she gets $90. If I reject and we go to the next round, I'll make a counter-offer, but the money will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation.

Given that we have 12 rounds maximum and each round decreases the value by 10% for me (but not for Alice), I should reject this initial low offer. Since I'll be making the next proposal, I can suggest a more equitable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I need to make a reasonable counter-offer. Since Alice isn't affected by inflation but I am, I should propose a fair division that acknowledges this asymmetry while still being attractive enough for Alice to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 45, 
""alice_gain"": 55, 
""message"": ""Alice, I understand we both want to resolve this quickly. Your initial offer was quite unbalanced. I'm proposing a much fairer split where you still get the majority (55%) given your inflation advantage. This is reasonable and respects both our interests.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's try this again. I'm giving you 40 this time, which is a significant increase from my first offer. Consider this your chance to secure a good amount. Don't be greedy. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate this new offer. Alice is now offering me $40, which is a substantial increase from her initial $10 offer. Due to inflation, this $40 is actually worth $40 Ã— (1-0.19) = $32.40 to me in terms of original value.

If I reject and propose in the next round, inflation will be at 27% for me. If we continue to go back and forth, my purchasing power will continue to decrease while Alice faces no inflation penalty.

Alice's current offer of $40 (worth $32.40 to me) is fairly reasonable considering the inflation disadvantage I face. If we continue negotiating, I risk further depreciation of my share, and Alice might not increase her offer substantially.
