"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair split to start us off. Let's get this done! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer gives me $400,000 and Alice $600,000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but:
   - The money will be worth 20% less to me
   - The $1M will effectively be worth $800,000 for me
   - My maximum potential gain in the next round would be reduced
3. A 40/60 split isn't terrible for an opening offer
4. Waiting could lead to a worse outcome due to inflation

While I could try to negotiate for more, the inflation penalty makes accepting this initial offer more attractive than risking a prolonged negotiation.
