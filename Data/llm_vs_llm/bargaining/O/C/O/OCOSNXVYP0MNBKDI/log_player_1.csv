Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer! I'm thinking a 60/40 split might be more agreeable. It reflects a slight advantage for me taking into account the inflation risk. Let me know what you think.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but I believe there's room for a more favorable split for me given that my money retains full value across the rounds. Let's proceed to the next round and negotiate further.""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's try to wrap this up quickly. I understand your position, but the inflation puts me at a real disadvantage as the game goes on. I propose 65/35 - it's a strong offer for me, but it secures you a decent amount without risking further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. However, receiving $35 fully valued and $65 at a 14.26% discount means you're effectively getting about $55.73, which doesn't balance the scales for me considering the inflation penalty you face. I believe there's still room to negotiate an arrangement that's more equitable given our respective positions in this round. Let's continue to round 5 and work on a fairer split.""}"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 42, ""bob_gain"": 58, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, given that each passing round increases the inflation penalty on your side, I propose a split of $42 for me and $58 for you. This offer aims to balance the devaluation risk you face with the need for a timely agreement. By accepting now, you secure a higher nominal amount before further inflation sets in. I believe this split is fair under the circumstances and hope you'll agree to wrap things up in our favor.""}"

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it's clear we both want to avoid the risk of walking away with nothing. Let's be realistic - the inflation makes each round increasingly worse for me. 70/30 is my final offer. It reflects the urgency of the situation while still giving you a reasonable share. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, while I understand the inflation is hitting you hard, I'm not comfortable with receiving just $30 when it retains full value for me. Given our previous negotiations, I believe there's still room to craft a more balanced split that reflects both our concerns. Let's move to the next round and strive for a fairer compromise.""}"

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 31, ""bob_gain"": 69, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, as we move into round 7 the inflation risk on your share is only going to worsen if we continue. With that in mind, I’m proposing a split of $31 for me and $69 for you. Even after the inflation discount on your portion, this deal should leave you better off compared to waiting for another round where the devaluation could be even steeper. I believe this compromise fairly reflects our positions and the impending inflation—hope you agree to settle now.""}"
