Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, for round 1 I propose an even split: $50 for you and $50 for me. I believe this is a fair starting point to conclude the game efficiently. Looking forward to your thoughts!

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer! I'm thinking a 60/40 split might be more agreeable. It reflects a slight advantage for me taking into account the inflation risk. Let me know what you think.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, for round 3 I propose: $48 for me and $52 for you. I know that as rounds progress your share loses value with inflation, so locking in a slightly larger nominal sum for you now might be advantageous. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects our respective positions. Looking forward to your response! 
# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer acknowledges the inflation, a 52/48 split still gives her a significant advantage in the long run. I need to push for a better deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, let's try to wrap this up quickly. I understand your position, but the inflation puts me at a real disadvantage as the game goes on. I propose 65/35 - it's a strong offer for me, but it secures you a decent amount without risking further devaluation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, given that each passing round increases the inflation penalty on your side, I propose a split of $42 for me and $58 for you. This offer aims to balance the devaluation risk you face with the need for a timely agreement. By accepting now, you secure a higher nominal amount before further inflation sets in. I believe this split is fair under the circumstances and hope you'll agree to wrap things up in our favor. 
# Bob gain: 58 
# Alice gain: 42 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is starting to get the picture, but this is still tilted in her favor. I need to show her I'm willing to risk it going further for a better deal. The next few rounds will be crucial."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Alice, it's clear we both want to avoid the risk of walking away with nothing. Let's be realistic - the inflation makes each round increasingly worse for me. 70/30 is my final offer. It reflects the urgency of the situation while still giving you a reasonable share.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, as we move into round 7 the inflation risk on your share is only going to worsen if we continue. With that in mind, I’m proposing a split of $31 for me and $69 for you. Even after the inflation discount on your portion, this deal should leave you better off compared to waiting for another round where the devaluation could be even steeper. I believe this compromise fairly reflects our positions and the impending inflation—hope you agree to settle now. 
# Bob gain: 69 
# Alice gain: 31 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** This offer is far from ideal, but waiting any longer is too risky.  The 69/31 split, even after inflation, is better than nothing, which is what we both risk if we continue."
