"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and start with 60-40, I'm open to negotiations 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me $40, while keeping $60 for herself. 

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the money will be worth 10% less to me, so any amount I get would effectively be reduced by that percentage. However, Alice doesn't face this depreciation.

Currently, $40 at full value is better than having to negotiate further with diminishing returns on my end. While I could try to negotiate for more, the time pressure and asymmetric inflation work against me.

Given these factors, this is actually a reasonably fair opening offer considering my weakened negotiating position due to the inflation penalty.
