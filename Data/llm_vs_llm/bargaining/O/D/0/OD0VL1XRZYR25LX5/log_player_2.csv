Let's keep pushing for a more equitable split. Alice's shares are decreasing in value each round due to inflation, so it's in her best interest to accept a fair split sooner rather than later."

Alice's offer is getting less attractive for her with each round due to inflation. Let's see if we can get a more fair split in the next round. We're already in the second half of the game, so it might be wise to start considering accepting reasonable offers, but this one is still not quite there."

Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

With only a few rounds left and Alice's shares decreasing in value significantly due to inflation, it's in our best interest to accept this offer and secure a gain. If we reject this offer, there's a risk that Alice might accept a lower offer from us in the next round due to the inflation pressure on her. Therefore, it's better to secure a gain of 3800 now."
