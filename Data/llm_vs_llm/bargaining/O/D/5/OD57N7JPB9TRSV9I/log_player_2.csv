"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this... 

Alice has offered a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance. However, if I reject, I could propose a better deal for myself in the next round. But I need to consider:

1. The 5% inflation penalty per round means that if I reject, the $5000 would be worth $4750 to me in the next round
2. There's no guarantee Alice would accept a more favorable offer from me
3. This is a reasonable starting offer that gives me half of the total amount
4. We have limited rounds, and prolonging negotiations could lead to worse outcomes

Given these factors, especially the inflation penalty, I believe accepting this fair split is the best strategic choice.
