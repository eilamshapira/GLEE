"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll propose an offer to Bob for the division of $1,000,000, taking into account the inflation factor that affects Bob more than me.

{""alice_gain"": 760000,
""bob_gain"": 240000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing you get $240,000 while I get $760,000. This is actually fair because if you reject and we go to the next round, the total value to you decreases by 20%. So your $240,000 now is worth more than any amount you could reasonably propose in the next round that I would accept.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest option and avoids any further risk of losing value. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 800000,
""bob_gain"": 200000,
""message"": ""Bob, consider the inflation effect carefully. If you reject this offer, in the next round the money will be worth another 20% less to you. My offer of $200,000 to you now is actually worth more than what you'd get if we continue negotiating. This is mathematically your best option at this point, as any further rounds will significantly reduce the real value for you.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we are both losing value with each round. I'm willing to give you a larger share, but this is my final offer. If we keep going, the value will only continue to drop. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 850000,
""bob_gain"": 150000,
""message"": ""Bob, the inflation is severely impacting your position. At this point, your $150,000 is worth only about $77,000 compared to round 1 value, but it's still better than what you'd get if we continue. If you reject and we go to round 6, any amount would be worth even less to you. This is a mathematically optimal offer based on our situation.""}"
