"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing you get $240000 while I get $760000. This is actually fair because if you reject and we go to the next round, the total value to you decreases by 20%. So your $240000 now is worth more than any amount you could reasonably propose in the next round that I would accept. 
# Bob gain: 240000 
# Alice gain: 760000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest option and avoids any further risk of losing value.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, consider the inflation effect carefully. If you reject this offer, in the next round the money will be worth another 20% less to you. My offer of $200000 to you now is actually worth more than what you'd get if we continue negotiating. This is mathematically your best option at this point, as any further rounds will significantly reduce the real value for you. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Alice, we are both losing value with each round. I'm willing to give you a larger share, but this is my final offer. If we keep going, the value will only continue to drop.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the inflation is severely impacting your position. At this point, your $150000 is worth only about $77000 compared to round 1 value, but it's still better than what you'd get if we continue. If you reject and we go to round 6, any amount would be worth even less to you. This is a mathematically optimal offer based on our situation. 
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000
