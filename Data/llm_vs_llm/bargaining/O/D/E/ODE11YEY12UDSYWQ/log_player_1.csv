"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. I want to account for the inflation I'll be facing if we go to further rounds. Here's my offer:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

My reasoning: I'm proposing a split where I get 60% and Bob gets 40%. This gives me a buffer against the 5% inflation I'll face in subsequent rounds, while still offering Bob a significant portion."
