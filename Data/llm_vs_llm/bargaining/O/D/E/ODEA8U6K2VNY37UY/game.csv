60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering I'm making the first move, and you'll have the chance to counter if you disagree.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Alice, let's start with a more balanced split. I propose 55 for me and 45 for you. This accounts for the inflation that will affect me if we go to another round.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
65.0,35.0,"Bob, since you're affected by 20% inflation each round, your $35 now is worth about the same as $44 in round 1. This is actually a fair offer considering the inflation effect on your gains. We should agree soon to avoid further devaluation of your share.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
40.0,60.0,"Alice, the inflation is hitting me hard. I need 60 to make this worthwhile considering the devaluation of my gains. Let's close the deal.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
70.0,30.0,"Bob, let's be rational about this. With the current 48.8% inflation affecting your gains, your $30 now is equivalent to about $15.36 in round 1 value. If we continue further, inflation will make your position even worse. This is actually a generous offer considering the circumstances.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
30.0,70.0,"Alice, this is getting ridiculous. My money is losing value rapidly. I need 70 to even consider this at this point. It's the only way I can make this worthwhile given the massive inflation affecting my share.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
80.0,20.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. With 67.23% inflation affecting your gains, even this $20 offer is still worth more than what your $70 request would be worth after more rounds of inflation. We need to conclude this deal soon, or inflation will continue to erode any value you might get.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
15.0,85.0,"Alice, I'm almost at the point where this is pointless due to inflation. 85 is my final offer. Take it or we both walk away with nothing. This is the only way I can recoup any real value given the massive losses I'm incurring each round.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
85.0,15.0,"Bob, with 79.03% inflation affecting your gains, this $15 offer is actually worth more than what you'd get in later rounds with a larger nominal amount. We have only 3 rounds left after this - if we don't reach an agreement soon, we both get nothing. This is a reasonable offer given the circumstances.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
10.0,90.0,"Alice, this is the last reasonable offer I can make. My money is essentially worthless at this point. Take 10 and let me salvage something from this ordeal.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
90.0,10.0,"Bob, we have only one round left after this. With 86.58% inflation on your gains, this $10 is still worth more than what you'd get in the final round with a larger amount. If we don't agree in these final rounds, we both get nothing. Be rational and accept this offer.",Alice,11,
