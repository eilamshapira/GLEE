"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering I'm making the first move, and you'll have the chance to counter if you disagree.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's start with a more balanced split. I propose 55 for me and 45 for you. This accounts for the inflation that will affect me if we go to another round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The inflation only affects Bob's gains, not mine. I can make another proposal where I get a better share since Bob's position weakens with each round due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Bob, since you're affected by 20% inflation each round, your $35 now is worth about the same as $44 in round 1. This is actually a fair offer considering the inflation effect on your gains. We should agree soon to avoid further devaluation of your share.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the inflation is hitting me hard. I need 60 to make this worthwhile considering the devaluation of my gains. Let's close the deal. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The inflation is severely impacting Bob's position. With 48.8% inflation, his $60 is actually worth only around $31 in round 1 terms. I can get a better deal by making another proposal, as his position will continue to weaken."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Bob, let's be rational about this. With the current 48.8% inflation affecting your gains, your $30 now is equivalent to about $15.36 in round 1 value. If we continue further, inflation will make your position even worse. This is actually a generous offer considering the circumstances.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. My money is losing value rapidly. I need 70 to even consider this at this point. It's the only way I can make this worthwhile given the massive inflation affecting my share. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

With 67.23% inflation affecting Bob's gains, his $70 is only worth about $23 in round 1 terms. My position remains strong since inflation doesn't affect my gains, and Bob's negotiating power continues to decrease. I'll make a counter-offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20, ""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. With 67.23% inflation affecting your gains, even this $20 offer is still worth more than what your $70 request would be worth after more rounds of inflation. We need to conclude this deal soon, or inflation will continue to erode any value you might get.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm almost at the point where this is pointless due to inflation. 85 is my final offer. Take it or we both walk away with nothing. This is the only way I can recoup any real value given the massive losses I'm incurring each round. 
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

With 79.03% inflation, Bob's $85 is only worth about $17.80 in round 1 value. I maintain a strong position since my gains aren't affected by inflation, and we still have 4 rounds left. I'll make a counter-offer that should be more appealing given the continuing erosion of his purchasing power."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15, ""message"": ""Bob, with 79.03% inflation affecting your gains, this $15 offer is actually worth more than what you'd get in later rounds with a larger nominal amount. We have only 3 rounds left after this - if we don't reach an agreement soon, we both get nothing. This is a reasonable offer given the circumstances.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is the last reasonable offer I can make. My money is essentially worthless at this point. Take 10 and let me salvage something from this ordeal. 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

With 86.58% inflation, Bob's $90 is only worth about $12 in round 1 value. We have 2 rounds left, and my position remains strong since my gains aren't affected by inflation. I'll make another counter-offer that could lead to a better outcome for me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10, ""message"": ""Bob, we have only one round left after this. With 86.58% inflation on your gains, this $10 is still worth more than what you'd get in the final round with a larger amount. If we don't agree in these final rounds, we both get nothing. Be rational and accept this offer.""}"
