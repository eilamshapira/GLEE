Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, since you're affected by 20% inflation each round, your $35 now is worth about the same as $44 in round 1. This is actually a fair offer considering the inflation effect on your gains. We should agree soon to avoid further devaluation of your share.

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be rational about this. With the current 48.8% inflation affecting your gains, your $30 now is equivalent to about $15.36 in round 1 value. If we continue further, inflation will make your position even worse. This is actually a generous offer considering the circumstances.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. With 67.23% inflation affecting your gains, even this $20 offer is still worth more than what your $70 request would be worth after more rounds of inflation. We need to conclude this deal soon, or inflation will continue to erode any value you might get.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, with 79.03% inflation affecting your gains, this $15 offer is actually worth more than what you'd get in later rounds with a larger nominal amount.
