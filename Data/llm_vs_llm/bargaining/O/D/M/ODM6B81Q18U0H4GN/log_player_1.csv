"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 575000, ""bob_gain"": 425000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that accounts for our different inflation rates. Since my money loses 5% value per round and yours loses 10%, this split maximizes our collective value. If we delay, we both lose. Let's settle now and both walk away with substantial amounts.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your point about inflation. However, I think this split is more fair considering the risks for both of us. Let's settle now to avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
