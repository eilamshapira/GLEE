"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that accounts for our different inflation rates. Since my money loses 5% value per round and yours loses 10%, this split maximizes our collective value. If we delay, we both lose. Let's settle now and both walk away with substantial amounts. 
# Bob gain: 425000 
# Alice gain: 575000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}
