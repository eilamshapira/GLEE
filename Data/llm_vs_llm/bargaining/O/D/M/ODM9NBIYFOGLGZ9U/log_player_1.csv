"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since this is the first round and I want to make a fair but strategic offer considering the 20% inflation penalty per round, I'll propose a slightly favorable split for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this split because:
1. It's still a reasonable offer for Bob
2. If Bob rejects, their next offer will be worth 20% less to me
3. This gives Bob an incentive to accept rather than drag out negotiations"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Due to 20% inflation, if I accept this offer now, my $5000 is actually worth $4000 to me
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer, the next round will have another 20% inflation for me
3. Any further delays will continue to reduce the value for me
4. A 50-50 split is generally considered fair
5. Given the inflation penalty, I'm unlikely to get a much better deal in later rounds
