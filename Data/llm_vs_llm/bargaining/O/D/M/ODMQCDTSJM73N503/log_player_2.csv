"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split, let's be reasonable 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000
2. If I reject, and we go to next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me
3. In the next round, I could propose a better split, but Alice might reject
4. 4000$ now is better than potentially getting nothing after 12 rounds
5. However, a 60-40 split in Alice's favor seems a bit unfair for a first offer

Given this is the first round and I still have many opportunities to negotiate better terms with minimal inflation impact, I'll reject this offer. I believe I can get a more equitable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split, considering we both need to reach an agreement:

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. This is the most equitable solution for both of us.""}

Reasoning:
1. A 50-50 split is the fairest starting point for negotiation
2. This shows I'm reasonable but also value fairness
3. The offer is better for Alice than what she might get if we keep going through rounds with inflation
4. It's early in the game, so even with 20% inflation on my side, I can still afford a few rounds of negotiation if needed"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the last offer, I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I still think I deserve a larger share 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Alice has slightly improved her offer from $4000 to $4200 for me
2. However, due to 36% inflation, $4200 is now only worth $2688 in round 1 value for me
3. The trend is concerning - each round makes my position worse due to inflation
4. Alice seems to be aware of my inflation problem and is using it as leverage
5. We still have 9 rounds left, but my negotiating power decreases each round
6. If I reject, in the next round my money will be worth 48.8% less than round 1

Given the significant inflation impact and the risk of getting even less value in future rounds, I should accept this offer. While it's not ideal, the inflation is severely hurting my negotiating position.
