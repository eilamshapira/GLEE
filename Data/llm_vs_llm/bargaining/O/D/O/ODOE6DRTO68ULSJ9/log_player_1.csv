"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a split that takes into account the different inflation rates we face. Since my inflation rate (20%) is higher than Bob's (5%), I should aim for a fair but quick agreement.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because:
1. It gives me a slight advantage (55%) while still being reasonable
2. Bob should be motivated to accept since waiting will cost him 5% per round
3. The split is simple and clear, showing good faith in negotiations"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The offer is too unbalanced in Bob's favor, especially considering I face higher inflation pressure. With 20% inflation for me vs 5% for Bob, I still have room to negotiate for a better deal in the next round. Even with the inflation impact, I believe we can reach a more equitable distribution."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that we're now in round 3, and my money is worth 40% less than the initial value while Bob's is only worth 10% less, I need to adjust my strategy while still maintaining a reasonable position.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm increasing my requested share to compensate for the higher inflation rate I face, but still keeping the offer reasonable enough that Bob might accept. If he rejects, his share will be worth even less in the next round due to his 5% inflation rate. This split would give me $600,000 (worth $360,000 to me after 40% inflation) and Bob $400,000 (worth $360,000 to him after 10% inflation), making it quite fair in real terms."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is still too unfavorable. Even though I'm facing higher inflation (48.8% vs 14.26%), Bob's proposed split of 30-70 is too extreme. My $300,000 would be worth only about $153,600 after my inflation, while his $700,000 would be worth about $600,200 after his inflation. 

We still have 8 rounds left, and while the inflation pressure is mounting, there's still room to negotiate for a more balanced distribution. I'll make a more competitive offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that we're in round 5, and my money is worth 59.04% less while Bob's is worth 18.55% less, I need to make a strategic offer that accounts for both our inflation rates and increases the chances of acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 575000, ""bob_gain"": 425000}

This offer is slightly more moderate than my last one because:
1. My $575,000 would be worth about $235,520 to me after inflation
2. Bob's $425,000 would be worth about $346,160 to him after inflation
3. While this still gives Bob a better real value, it's more balanced than his previous offer
4. The mounting inflation pressure on both sides should make this compromise more attractive
5. Further delays will hurt both of us significantly"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 275000 
# Bob gain: 725000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Despite the mounting inflation pressure, this offer is still too unfavorable. Let's analyze:
- My $275,000 would be worth only about $90,117 after 67.23% inflation
- Bob's $725,000 would be worth about $561,005 after 22.62% inflation

The gap is too large. Even with my higher inflation rate, this distribution is too unbalanced. We still have 6 rounds left, and while time is working against both of us (especially me), I believe we can reach a more equitable agreement. I'll make a more compromising offer in the next round to try to bridge the gap."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given we're in round 7 with my money worth 73.78% less and Bob's worth 26.49% less, I need to make a more compromising offer to reach an agreement before the situation worsens for both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000}

This is my most balanced offer yet because:
1. My $525,000 would be worth about $137,655 to me after inflation
2. Bob's $475,000 would be worth about $349,171 after inflation
3. While Bob still gets more real value, this is a significant concession from my previous offers
4. We only have 5 rounds left, and failure to agree means we both get nothing
5. The inflation rates are becoming very punishing for both of us

I hope Bob sees this as a genuine move toward compromise and accepts, as further delays will significantly harm both our potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Even with the severe inflation pressure, this offer is still too unbalanced. Let's analyze:
- My $250,000 would be worth only about $52,425 after 79.03% inflation
- Bob's $750,000 would be worth about $523,725 after 30.17% inflation

While time is definitely working against me with my higher inflation rate, accepting such an unbalanced offer would give me very little value. We have 4 rounds left, and I'll make a significantly more compromising offer in the next round to try to reach an agreement. The risk of getting nothing if we don't agree in the next 4 rounds should motivate both of us to find middle ground."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With only 3 rounds left after this one, and my money now worth 83.22% less while Bob's is worth 33.66% less, I need to make a very compromising offer to avoid the risk of both of us getting nothing.

{""alice_gain"": 475000, ""bob_gain"": 525000}

This is my most conciliatory offer because:
1. For the first time, I'm offering Bob more than 50% of the nominal amount
2. My $475,000 would be worth about $79,705 to me after inflation
3. Bob's $525,000 would be worth about $348,285 after inflation
4. While the real value gap is still significant, this is a major concession from my previous positions
5. With only 3 rounds left and the threat of getting nothing, this balanced offer should be attractive

I strongly hope Bob recognizes this as a serious attempt to reach agreement. The alternative of continued negotiation will only destroy more value for both of us."
