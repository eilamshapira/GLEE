This is a tough one. Alice is clearly getting desperate, but her offers are still heavily skewed in her favor. I'm banking on her cracking under the pressure of the rapidly devaluing money."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 725000, ""alice_gain"": 275000} 

I'm increasing my demand slightly. The devaluation hurts Alice significantly more than me, so the pressure is on her to accept a less favorable deal."

I'm holding firm.  It's getting close to the point where accepting a less favorable offer might make sense due to the rapid devaluation, but I think Alice will crack soon."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 750000, ""alice_gain"": 250000}

I'm raising my demand again, but just slightly. The goal is to signal firmness but also a willingness to negotiate. Alice is running out of time."

Finally! It's about time Alice got real. While I'd prefer a larger share, the devaluation is becoming significant. This offer is better than risking getting nothing in the final rounds."
