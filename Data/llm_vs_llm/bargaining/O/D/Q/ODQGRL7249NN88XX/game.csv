47.5,52.5,"I appreciate your fair starting offer. However, due to the 5% inflation penalty I face each round, I would lose value if negotiations continue. This slight adjustment compensates for one round of inflation risk (52.5 is approximately 50 plus 5% of 50). This way we both get fair value considering the time penalty I face.",Bob,2,
