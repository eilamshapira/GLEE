Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"":50,""bob_gain"":50,""message"":""Let's start equally and see how we can negotiate further.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fair starting offer. However, due to the 5% inflation penalty I face each round, I would lose value if negotiations continue. This slight adjustment compensates for one round of inflation risk (52.5 is approximately 50 plus 5% of 50). This way we both get fair value considering the time penalty I face. 
# Alice gain: 47.5 
# Bob gain: 52.5 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
