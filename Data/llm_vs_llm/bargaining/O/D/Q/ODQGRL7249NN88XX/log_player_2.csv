"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start equally and see how we can negotiate further. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice has proposed a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance. However, I need to account for the 5% inflation penalty I face with each round.

If I accept now, I get $50. If I reject and make a counter-offer, Alice might reject my offer, and we'd lose value due to inflation. After one round, the total value to me would be reduced by 5%.

Given that I face a disadvantage with the inflation penalty and we're just in the first round, I'll make a counter-offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 52.5, ""alice_gain"": 47.5, ""message"": ""I appreciate your fair starting offer. However, due to the 5% inflation penalty I face each round, I would lose value if negotiations continue. This slight adjustment compensates for one round of inflation risk (52.5 is approximately 50 plus 5% of 50). This way we both get fair value considering the time penalty I face.""}"
