400000.0,600000.0,"Hi Bob, to avoid the cost of delay (my share devalues by 20% each round), I'm proposing we settle now. I suggest that I take $400000 and you receive $600000. I believe this division fairly acknowledges the time-sensitivity of my position. What do you think?",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I understand your concern about the devaluation. However, considering that my share devalues by 5% each round, I would like to propose a slight adjustment. I suggest I take $550000 and you receive $450000. This way, we both get a fair share while acknowledging the time-sensitive nature of our positions.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, thank you for your proposal. Given that further delay would only diminish the value of my share even more (by 20% each round), I accept your offer of $450000 for me and $550000 for you. Let's settle it here.",Alice,2,accept
