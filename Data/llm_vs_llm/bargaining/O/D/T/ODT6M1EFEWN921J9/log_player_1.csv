"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, to avoid the cost of delay (my share devalues by 20% each round), I'm proposing we settle now. I suggest that I take $400,000 and you receive $600,000. I believe this division fairly acknowledges the time-sensitivity of my position. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about the devaluation. However, considering that my share devalues by 5% each round, I would like to propose a slight adjustment. I suggest I take $550000 and you receive $450000. This way, we both get a fair share while acknowledging the time-sensitive nature of our positions. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your proposal. Given that further delay would only diminish the value of my share even more (by 20% each round), I accept your offer of $450,000 for me and $550,000 for you. Let's settle it here.""}"
