"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to avoid the cost of delay (my share devalues by 20% each round), I'm proposing we settle now. I suggest that I take $400000 and you receive $600000. I believe this division fairly acknowledges the time-sensitivity of my position. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concern about the devaluation. However, considering that my share devalues by 5% each round, I would like to propose a slight adjustment. I suggest I take $550,000 and you receive $450,000. This way, we both get a fair share while acknowledging the time-sensitive nature of our positions.""}"
