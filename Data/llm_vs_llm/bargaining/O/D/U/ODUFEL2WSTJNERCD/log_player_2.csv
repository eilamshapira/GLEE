"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split is fair and benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
- She's offering me $4000 out of $10000 (40%)
- This is the first round, so I have many opportunities to counter
- There's no inflation effect for me, so waiting isn't costly
- 40% is below an equal split, and I believe I can get a better deal

I'll reject this offer and make my own proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split, slightly in my favor since Alice started with an uneven split:

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I believe a more balanced distribution would be fair. This is closer to a 50-50 split, which is more equitable for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your offer was a bit too low for me. This is a compromise, slightly closer to my original proposal. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze Alice's new offer:
- She's offering me $4300 (up from $4000 in round 1)
- I know inflation affects her gains (9.75% less value for her), but not mine
- Her $5700 is actually worth less to her due to inflation
- However, $4300 is still significantly below a fair split
- We still have 9 rounds left, and I'm not affected by inflation

Since time pressure affects Alice more than me (due to inflation), and the offer is still quite low, I'll reject and try to negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice showed some flexibility by increasing my share, I'll also move a bit from my previous position but still maintain a proposal that's favorable to me:

{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""I appreciate you increasing my share in your last offer. I'm also willing to compromise from my previous position. This split is more balanced and acknowledges both our interests.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is running out, and we both lose if we don't reach an agreement. This offer is a serious compromise, meeting closer to the middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze the situation:
1. Alice has increased her offer to $4600 (up from $4300 last time)
2. Inflation is significantly affecting her side (18.55% loss), making her $5400 worth much less to her
3. I'm not affected by inflation, so I maintain full purchasing power
4. We're in round 5, with 7 rounds remaining
5. Alice seems to be feeling the pressure of both time and inflation

Given that:
- Alice is gradually increasing my share
- Her share is being devalued by significant inflation
- I can still afford to wait since I'm not affected by inflation
- We still have several rounds left

I'll reject this offer, as the trend suggests I can get an even better deal by waiting.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation and has been making increasing offers, I'll maintain a firm position but show a small concession from my last offer:

{""bob_gain"": 5100,
""alice_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""I see you're trying to reach a compromise, and I've adjusted my offer slightly. Given the circumstances, this is a fair split that benefits both of us. Let's not risk running out of time.""}"
