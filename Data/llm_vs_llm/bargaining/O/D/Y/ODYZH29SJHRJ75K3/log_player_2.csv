Even with inflation, this offer is getting worse for me. I need to push for a better split in the next round."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

This is cutting it close, but with inflation cutting into my potential gains, it's becoming too risky to keep rejecting. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable amount even with the reduced value."
