8000.0,2000.0,"Alice, I appreciate your earlier generosity—but I must think about our mutual future value. In round 3 you’d be proposing on a pie worth only 6400 effective dollars, effectively giving you nearly 6400. To offer you an immediate deal without further devaluation, I propose that you get 8000 nominal dollars (which are worth 6400 effective) and I take 2000 nominal dollars (worth 1600 effective). I believe this matches your continuation value, so please accept this fair offer.",Bob,2,

6100.0,3900.0,"Alice, notice that in round 4 the total effective value is just 51.2% of the original, meaning every dollar now counts a lot more. If you reject, you'll have to wait for round 5 with a further 20% drop in value. I've calculated that if you wait, your best achievable outcome would be around an effective value equivalent to roughly 6000 nominal dollars. By offering you 6100 nominal now (which is 6100 × 0.512 ≈ 3117 effective), I'm giving you a slightly better deal than waiting would. I hope you see the advantage of securing a higher value immediately and accept this offer.",Bob,4,
