"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split reflects our positions in the negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer gives me $400,000 and Alice $600,000
2. If I reject, the next round's money will be worth 20% less to me
3. In the next round, $1M would effectively be worth $800,000 to me
4. My maximum possible gain in the next round would be $800,000 if I propose and Alice accepts
5. However, there's risk Alice would reject my counter-offer, leading to further rounds and more value loss

While the 40/60 split isn't ideal, accepting now guarantees me $400,000. Rejecting would mean I need to secure significantly more than 50% in the next round just to break even, which might be difficult to achieve.
