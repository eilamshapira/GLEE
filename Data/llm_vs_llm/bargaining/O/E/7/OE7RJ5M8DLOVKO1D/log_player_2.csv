"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share, let's end this! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $40 while she gets $60. She's calling this a ""fair share,"" but it's not an even split.

Since I face 20% inflation per round, if I reject now and we finish in the next round, the total amount would be worth 20% less to me. So if I were to get $50 in the next round, it would actually be worth $40 to me due to inflation.

Given this inflation penalty I face, Alice's offer of $40 now is equivalent to getting $50 in the next round. While it's not a 50-50 split, it does account for my inflation disadvantage.
