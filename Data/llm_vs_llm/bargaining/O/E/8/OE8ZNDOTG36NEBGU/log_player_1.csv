"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest we split the $1,000,000 evenlyâ€”$500,000 each. Accepting now avoids any further loss due to discounting on my part, and it ensures we both get a fair, immediate benefit.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation, I'd like a slightly bigger share. This way, we both still get a significant amount, and it's better to settle now rather than losing more value in the next rounds. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, your proposal seems reasonable given the inflation penalty I'll face with each round. I'm willing to settle on receiving $400,000 in round 2. Let's finalize this agreement and avoid further loss.""}"
