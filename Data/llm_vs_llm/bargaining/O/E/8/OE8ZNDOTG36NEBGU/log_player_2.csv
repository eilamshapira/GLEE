"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest we split the $1000000 evenlyâ€”$500000 each. Accepting now avoids any further loss due to discounting on my part, and it ensures we both get a fair, immediate benefit. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
