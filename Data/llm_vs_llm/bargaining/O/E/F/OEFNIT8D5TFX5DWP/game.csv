3776.69,6223.31,"Hi Bob, I'd like to propose the following: I receive $3776.69 and you receive $6223.31. Given we only have 12 rounds and each round costs us 10% of the total value, delaying only hurts us both. This division reflects the strategic equilibrium if we continue bargainingâ€”with you as proposer in round 2 having a continuation value of about $6223.31. Accepting now ensures we each lock in our respective shares before any further discounting. Looking forward to your thoughts!",Alice,1,
