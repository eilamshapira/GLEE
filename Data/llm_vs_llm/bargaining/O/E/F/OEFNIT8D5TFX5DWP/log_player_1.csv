"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 3776.69, ""bob_gain"": 6223.31, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'd like to propose the following: I receive $3,776.69 and you receive $6,223.31. Given we only have 12 rounds and each round costs us 10% of the total value, delaying only hurts us both. This division reflects the strategic equilibrium if we continue bargainingâ€”with you as proposer in round 2 having a continuation value of about $6,223.31. Accepting now ensures we each lock in our respective shares before any further discounting. Looking forward to your thoughts!""}"
