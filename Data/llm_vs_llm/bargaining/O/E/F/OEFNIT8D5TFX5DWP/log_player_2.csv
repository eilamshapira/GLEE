"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'd like to propose the following: I receive $3776.69 and you receive $6223.31. Given we only have 12 rounds and each round costs us 10% of the total value, delaying only hurts us both. This division reflects the strategic equilibrium if we continue bargainingâ€”with you as proposer in round 2 having a continuation value of about $6223.31. Accepting now ensures we each lock in our respective shares before any further discounting. Looking forward to your thoughts! 
# Bob gain: 6223.31 
# Alice gain: 3776.69 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $6,223.31 (62.2%) and taking $3,776.69 (37.8%)
2. The split is in my favor
3. Alice makes a valid point about the 10% depreciation per round
4. After one round, the total value would decrease to $9,000
5. The offer is actually quite fair and strategically sound
6. Rejecting would mean the next offer would be working with a smaller total

Given that:
- I'm getting a favorable majority of the money
- The offer is well-reasoned
- Waiting would reduce the total amount available
- There's no guarantee I could get a better deal in future rounds
