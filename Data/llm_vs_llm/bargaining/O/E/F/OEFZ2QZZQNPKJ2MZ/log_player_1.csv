"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob – to avoid further devaluation we might as well settle now. Given that waiting hurts me more (20% per round) than you (10% per round), I propose we agree immediately: I receive $4000 and you get $6000. This offer gives you a higher immediate payout than you’d expect if you waited a round to propose your own division. Let’s close this round and secure our shares before the money loses more of its value.""}"
