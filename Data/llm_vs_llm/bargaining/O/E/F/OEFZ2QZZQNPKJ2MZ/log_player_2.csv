"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob – to avoid further devaluation we might as well settle now. Given that waiting hurts me more (20% per round) than you (10% per round), I propose we agree immediately: I receive $4000 and you get $6000. This offer gives you a higher immediate payout than you’d expect if you waited a round to propose your own division. Let’s close this round and secure our shares before the money loses more of its value. 
# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Alice's offer gives me $6000 immediately, and waiting would decrease the value of the money, I should consider whether this is a good deal.

If I reject this offer, the money will be worth 10% less to me in the next round, so the total amount I'd be dividing would be $10,000 * 0.9 = $9,000 for me, and $10,000 * 0.8 = $8,000 for Alice.

Considering this, I think Alice's initial offer is reasonable, as it gives me more than I might expect if I waited and proposed my own division in the next round.
