"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. I'll take the depreciation into account when making my offer. Here's my first proposal:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

My reasoning: I'm offering Bob $40 in the first round. This is a reasonable starting point, giving him a significant portion while ensuring I also get a good amount considering the potential for depreciation in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 16.67 
# Bob gain: 83.33 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the depreciation of the money's value for me, and Bob's gain:

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Reasoning: Bob's offer of $16.67 is far too low, especially considering the 20% depreciation for me. Even with the depreciation, I would still prefer to make a counter-offer in the next round. I'm willing to risk further depreciation to try and get a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I need to consider the depreciation again. This is round 3, so my money is now worth 40% less than in round 1, and Bob's money is worth 10% less.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

Reasoning: I am increasing my share slightly compared to my first offer. While the money is depreciating for both of us, Bob rejected my initial offer and his offer was extremely unfavorable. I still need to aim for a decent portion to make this worthwhile, given the depreciation. I'm hoping $30 is enough to entice him to accept, considering his money is also depreciating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 32.55 
# Bob gain: 67.45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Reasoning:

Okay, the depreciation is hitting hard. My money is worth nearly half of what it was in the beginning. While I would prefer a higher amount, accepting $32.55 now is likely better than risking further depreciation in the next round. Also, Bob is getting a significantly lower value for his portion, and a rejection would likely lead to a low offer from me in the next round, which he would reject. This seems like the best option to secure some value before it diminishes further."
