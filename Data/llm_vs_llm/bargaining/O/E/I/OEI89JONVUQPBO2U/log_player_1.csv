I propose that I get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. I figure this is a fair starting point, given I'm taking the risk of going first."

I'm still willing to negotiate.  This offer gives Bob $300,000, which is a significant amount, but still favors me due to the ongoing inflation."

This isn't ideal, but I'm getting nervous about the rapid inflation. It's better to take what I can get at this point."
