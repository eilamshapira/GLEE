Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose a fair 50-50 split of the money, with each of us receiving $500,000. This is an equitable division that recognizes both of our positions in this negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I propose a slightly adjusted split where I receive $550,000 and Alice receives $450,000. Given that inflation is affecting me at 10% per round, I need to account for this decreasing value. This is still a reasonable and fair division that acknowledges both our positions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split where I receive $600,000 and Alice receives $400,000. We're now in round 6 with inflation increasingly affecting both of us. This offer acknowledges that we need to reach an agreement soon before inflation further reduces the value for both of us. This is a reasonable compromise given our current situation."
