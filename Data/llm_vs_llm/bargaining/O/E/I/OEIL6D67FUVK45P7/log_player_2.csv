I'm rejecting this offer because it's still heavily skewed in Alice's favor, even with the inflation working against her.  I need to push for a more equitable split."

A 50/50 split seems fair, especially since inflation is working against Alice. It's better to take this deal now than risk getting a worse offer later."
