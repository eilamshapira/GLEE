"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. 60/40 split, take it or leave it. Remember, inflation is eating away at our potential gains! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
1. She's offering me $40 out of $100
2. If I reject, next round I can make an offer, but the money will be worth 20% less
3. $40 now is better than $50 worth only $40 (after 20% inflation) in the next round
4. There's risk in rejection as Alice might not accept my counter-offer

While 60/40 isn't perfectly equal, it's a reasonable first offer considering the inflation pressure. The risk of losing value through inflation and potential future rejections outweighs the potential gain from negotiating for a slightly better deal.
