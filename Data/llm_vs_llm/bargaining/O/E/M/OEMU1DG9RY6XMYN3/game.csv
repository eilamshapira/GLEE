600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob! I'm offering you a fair $400000 while I take $600000. Remember that your money loses 10% value each round, so this is actually a good deal for you right now.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think $550000 for me and $450000 for you is a fairer split considering the inflation impact on my side. Let me know if you agree!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
575000.0,425000.0,"Bob, let's be practical. Due to the 20% depreciation you're facing, this $425000 is actually worth $340000 to you now. If we keep negotiating, your share will be worth even less. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
475000.0,525000.0,"Hi Alice, given the inflation, I'm proposing $525000 for me and $475000 for you. This accounts for my depreciation and aims to make it fairer overall. Let's try to reach an agreement!",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I'm increasing your share to $450000, but consider that waiting further will only decrease its value more. At the current 34% depreciation, this $450000 is worth about $297000 to you. If we continue negotiating, you'll lose even more value. This is a fair offer given the circumstances - let's conclude this deal now.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
490000.0,510000.0,"Alice, given the ongoing inflation impact on my end, I propose $510000 for me and $490000 for you. This aims to reach a middle ground where we both benefit reasonably. Let's finalize this!",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
540000.0,460000.0,"Bob, let's be realistic about the situation. At this point, your $460000 is worth less than $244000 to you due to the 47% depreciation. Further delays will only reduce your value more significantly. This is actually a better deal for you than your last offer in real terms. Let's end this negotiation now before your share loses even more value.",Alice,7,

505000.0,495000.0,"Alice, given the inflation impact, I'm proposing $495000 for me and $505000 for you. This is quite close and should be fair considering the depreciation I'm experiencing. Let's wrap this up!",Bob,8,
