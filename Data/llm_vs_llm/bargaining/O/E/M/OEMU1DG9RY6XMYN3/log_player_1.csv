"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a strategic first offer, considering that Bob faces 10% depreciation per round while I don't.

{""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm offering you a fair $400,000 while I take $600,000. Remember that your money loses 10% value each round, so this is actually a good deal for you right now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think $550000 for me and $450000 for you is a fairer split considering the inflation impact on my side. Let me know if you agree! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:
1. Bob's $550,000 is now worth 10% less to him (effectively $495,000)
2. My potential $450,000 maintains its full value
3. If I reject, we go to round 3 where I can make an offer, but Bob's value will decrease by another 10%
4. I still have negotiating power since Bob's money keeps losing value
5. We have 10 more rounds, giving me room to negotiate for a better deal

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's money is now worth 20% less to him, I'll adjust my offer accordingly but make it more appealing than my first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 575000,
""bob_gain"": 425000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical. Due to the 20% depreciation you're facing, this $425,000 is actually worth $340,000 to you now. If we keep negotiating, your share will be worth even less. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, given the inflation, I'm proposing $525000 for me and $475000 for you. This accounts for my depreciation and aims to make it fairer overall. Let's try to reach an agreement! 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob's $525,000 is now worth 27.1% less to him (effectively about $382,725)
2. My $475,000 maintains full value
3. The offer is better than his last one for me
4. However, with 8 rounds left and Bob's money continuing to depreciate, I still have leverage
5. By round 5, Bob's money will be worth about 34% less
6. I can likely get a better deal by continuing

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Given that Bob's money is now worth about 34% less to him, I'll make a strategic offer that appears more generous than my last one but still maintains my advantage.

{""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm increasing your share to $450,000, but consider that waiting further will only decrease its value more. At the current 34% depreciation, this $450,000 is worth about $297,000 to you. If we continue negotiating, you'll lose even more value. This is a fair offer given the circumstances - let's conclude this deal now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, given the ongoing inflation impact on my end, I propose $510000 for me and $490000 for you. This aims to reach a middle ground where we both benefit reasonably. Let's finalize this! 
# Alice gain: 490000 
# Bob gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
1. Bob's $510,000 is worth 40.95% less to him (effectively about $301,155)
2. My $490,000 maintains full value
3. This is his best offer yet for me
4. However, Bob's position is weakening significantly with each round
5. With 6 rounds left, his money will continue to depreciate rapidly
6. I can likely secure an even better deal by waiting, as his bargaining power diminishes

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With Bob's money now worth about 47% less, I'll make a strategic offer that emphasizes the rapidly diminishing value of further negotiations.

{""alice_gain"": 540000,
""bob_gain"": 460000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic about the situation. At this point, your $460,000 is worth less than $244,000 to you due to the 47% depreciation. Further delays will only reduce your value more significantly. This is actually a better deal for you than your last offer in real terms. Let's end this negotiation now before your share loses even more value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, given the inflation impact, I'm proposing $495000 for me and $505000 for you. This is quite close and should be fair considering the depreciation I'm experiencing. Let's wrap this up! 
# Alice gain: 505000 
# Bob gain: 495000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:
1. Bob has now offered me $505,000 - his best offer yet
2. His $495,000 is worth only about $236,759 to him due to 52.17% depreciation 
3. We have 4 rounds left, and his money will continue to lose value
4. However, there's also risk in continuing too long
5. While I could potentially get more, this is a solid offer and the risk/reward ratio of continuing is less favorable
6. Taking this deal now guarantees me a good outcome
