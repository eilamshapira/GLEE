"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me 4000$ and keeping 6000$ for herself
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, my money will be worth less if I wait
4. 4000$ now vs. potentially more money but worth 5% less next round
5. 5% of 4000$ is 200$, so next round I'd need to get at least 4200$ to break even

I think I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer, even accounting for inflation.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer, but considering I've already lost 5% value due to inflation:

{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800}

I propose this split because:
1. It's closer to a fair 50-50 division
2. I need to account for the 5% value I've already lost
3. It's still reasonable enough that Alice might accept rather than risk further inflation
4. If Alice rejects, she'll face the same inflation pressure in the next round"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me 4500$, but with 9.75% inflation, it's actually worth about 4061$ to me
2. This is only slightly better than her first offer (4000$)
3. If I reject, I can make another offer, but:
   - Next round my money will be worth 14.75% less
   - 4500$ now (worth 4061$) vs. needing to get significantly more next round to compensate for additional inflation
4. We've already used 3 rounds out of 12, and the inflation is stacking against me
5. The offer is more balanced than the first one (4500/5500 vs 4000/6000)

Given the mounting inflation pressure and the improved offer, I should accept.
