"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has offered an equal split of the $10,000, giving each of us $5,000.

I need to consider that with each passing round, the money is worth 10% less to me due to inflation. If I reject now and make a counter-offer, even if I ask for more, the total value will be reduced by 10%.

Let's analyze:
- Current offer: $5,000 for me
- If I reject and we go to round 2, the maximum I could get (even if I asked for all $10,000) would be worth only $9,000 to me due to 10% inflation

Since $5,000 now is better than potentially getting slightly more in a depreciated state, and the offer is fair to begin with, I'll accept.
