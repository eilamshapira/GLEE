450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Alice, thanks for your initial offer. Given the inflation penalty that affects me (losing 10% value each round), I'm proposing a more balanced split where I get $550000 and you get $450000. This still gives you a substantial amount while acknowledging the time pressure I'm under. I hope we can agree and conclude the negotiation now.",Bob,2,
