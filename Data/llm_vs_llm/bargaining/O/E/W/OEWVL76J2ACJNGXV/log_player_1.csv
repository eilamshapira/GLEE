Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $600,000 and you receive $400,000. I'm keen to settle this now, as further rounds would reduce my share due to inflation. Looking forward to your response.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your initial offer. Given the inflation penalty that affects me (losing 10% value each round), I'm proposing a more balanced split where I get $550000 and you get $450000. This still gives you a substantial amount while acknowledging the time pressure I'm under. I hope we can agree and conclude the negotiation now. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
