"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $600000 and you receive $400000. I'm keen to settle this now, as further rounds would reduce my share due to inflation. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing I receive $400,000 out of the $1,000,000, which is 40% of the total amount. 

If I reject this offer, I'll get to make a counter-proposal in the next round, but the total amount will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation. So effectively, I'd be negotiating over $900,000 (from my perspective).

Since I can make the next offer if I reject, and inflation impacts me but may affect Alice differently, I think I should try to negotiate for a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more favorable to me while still being reasonable to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your initial offer. Given the inflation penalty that affects me (losing 10% value each round), I'm proposing a more balanced split where I get $550,000 and you get $450,000. This still gives you a substantial amount while acknowledging the time pressure I'm under. I hope we can agree and conclude the negotiation now.""}"
