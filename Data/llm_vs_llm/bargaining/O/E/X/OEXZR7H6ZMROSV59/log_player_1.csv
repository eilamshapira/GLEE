"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to be mindful of the decreasing value of the money with each round due to inflation. To start, I'll make a generous offer to Bob to increase the chances of acceptance and avoid immediate loss of value.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I see Bob's offer. Considering the inflation, the $50 I would receive is worth 10% less than it was in Round 1.

Let's analyze:

*   **My Round 1 Offer:** $55 (worth full value)
*   **Bob's Round 2 Offer:** $50 (worth 10% less to me)

$50 with 10% inflation is equal to $45
I think this is a bad offer, I will reject it.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, it's my turn again. Inflation is continuing to erode the value of the money. I need to make an offer that's appealing to Bob while also securing a reasonable amount for myself, considering the decreasing value. Since Bob offered 50/50 in the last round, I'll try to get a slightly better deal for myself while still being fair.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 52,
""bob_gain"": 48
}
```"
