5000.0,5000.0,"I propose a 50/50 split which is truly fair. Since I face 5% inflation each round and you don't, time works against me. This equal division respects both our interests.",Bob,2,

6500.0,3500.0,"Considering the inflation, I'm being generous with this 65/35 split. It's in your best interest to accept before the value drops further",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5250.0,4750.0,"Alice, let's be reasonable. You face no inflation penalty while I lose 5% each round. This 47.5/52.5 split acknowledges your slight advantage in negotiations while still being fair. Further delays only erode the total value I can receive, hurting us both. Let's conclude this now.",Bob,4,

7000.0,3000.0,"Time is running out, and the inflation penalty is taking its toll on your share. This 70/30 split is my final generous offer before I consider taking an even larger share",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Alice, we're already at round 6 with significant inflation impact on my share. This 45/55 split acknowledges your negotiating advantage while still being fair enough that we can both walk away satisfied. We have only 6 rounds left, and if we don't agree, we both get nothing. Let's be reasonable and conclude this now rather than risk leaving empty-handed.",Bob,6,
