"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60/40 seems reasonable""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 50/50 split which is truly fair. Since I face 5% inflation each round and you don't, time works against me. This equal division respects both our interests. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is still worth the same, but Bob's offer is now effectively less valuable to him due to inflation, I'll think carefully about this.

Considering Bob's argument about the 5% inflation affecting him, a 50/50 split might seem fair. However, I should also think about my own advantage in this situation.

For now, I'll reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's money is worth 5% less with each passing round, and mine remains the same, I'll try to take advantage of this situation.

In Round 2, Bob's $5000 was worth 5% less than the original $5000, which means it's now worth $4750 to him (due to 5% inflation). I'll keep this in mind when making my next offer.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 6500, 
""bob_gain"": 3500, 
""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm being generous with this 65/35 split. It's in your best interest to accept before the value drops further""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. You face no inflation penalty while I lose 5% each round. This 47.5/52.5 split acknowledges your slight advantage in negotiations while still being fair. Further delays only erode the total value I can receive, hurting us both. Let's conclude this now. 
# Alice gain: 5250 
# Bob gain: 4750 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to appeal to my sense of reason and fairness. He's right that the inflation penalty affects him more with each passing round, and that further delays will erode the total value he can receive.

However, I should also consider my own position and the fact that I don't face any inflation penalty. This gives me a significant advantage in the negotiations.

Looking at Bob's offer, a 52.5/47.5 split in my favor is a decent proposal, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. Since Bob's money is worth 14.26% less than the original amount, his $4750 is actually worth approximately $4076 to him.

I'll think carefully about this, but for now, I'll reject this offer and see if I can get an even better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a 52.5/47.5 split in my favor, I'll try to push for an even more advantageous split.

Considering the inflation penalty, Bob's money is now worth approximately 19.08% less than the original amount (5% x 3 rounds for the first 3 rounds, and then the initial 5% for the first round, but now it is 4 rounds, 5% x 4 = 20%, but he got 5% less in the first round, so 20% - 0.92% = 19.08% less). I'll use this to my advantage.

Here's my offer for Round 5:

{""alice_gain"": 7000, 
""bob_gain"": 3000, 
""message"": ""Time is running out, and the inflation penalty is taking its toll on your share. This 70/30 split is my final generous offer before I consider taking an even larger share""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're already at round 6 with significant inflation impact on my share. This 45/55 split acknowledges your negotiating advantage while still being fair enough that we can both walk away satisfied. We have only 6 rounds left, and if we don't agree, we both get nothing. Let's be reasonable and conclude this now rather than risk leaving empty-handed. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is getting desperate, and the inflation penalty is really starting to hurt his share. He's right that we only have 6 rounds left, and if we don't agree, we'll both end up with nothing.

Looking at Bob's offer, a 55/45 split in my favor is a decent proposal. Considering the inflation penalty, Bob's $4500 is actually worth approximately $3483 to him (due to 22.62% less value).

I'll think carefully about this. While I could try to push for an even more advantageous split, I also need to consider the risk of not reaching an agreement. If we don't agree, we'll both get nothing, which would be a worse outcome for both of us.

For now, I'll accept this offer, as it seems reasonable and allows us to both walk away with something.
