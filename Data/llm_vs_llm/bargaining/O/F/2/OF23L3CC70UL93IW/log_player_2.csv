"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, 60/40 seems reasonable 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is suggesting a 60/40 split in her favor, which means I would get $4,000. Given that I face a 5% inflation penalty each round, the value of money decreases for me if I delay.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value would be worth 5% less to me, so the $10,000 would effectively be worth $9,500 from my perspective. I should consider whether I can reasonably expect to get more than $4,000 in future rounds, accounting for inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that acknowledges the inflation pressure I face while still seeking a more balanced split.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""I propose a 50/50 split which is truly fair. Since I face 5% inflation each round and you don't, time works against me. This equal division respects both our interests.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm being generous with this 65/35 split. It's in your best interest to accept before the value drops further 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer carefully. She's now offering me $3,500, which is less than her initial offer of $4,000. Additionally, due to inflation, the money is now worth 9.75% less to me than in the first round, so $3,500 now is equivalent to about $3,159 in first-round value.

Alice seems to be taking advantage of the inflation pressure I face. If I reject and we continue to the next round, I'll face even more inflation, but I should be able to make a more reasonable counter-offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4750, 
""alice_gain"": 5250, 
""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. You face no inflation penalty while I lose 5% each round. This 47.5/52.5 split acknowledges your slight advantage in negotiations while still being fair. Further delays only erode the total value I can receive, hurting us both. Let's conclude this now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is running out, and the inflation penalty is taking its toll on your share. This 70/30 split is my final generous offer before I consider taking an even larger share 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is now offering me $3,000, which is even less than her previous offers. With the 18.55% inflation penalty, this $3,000 is actually worth about $2,443 in first-round value to me.

Alice is clearly leveraging the inflation pressure against me, making progressively worse offers. If I reject, I'll face further inflation, but she seems to be using an aggressive strategy that may lead to neither of us getting anything if we don't reach an agreement soon.

Given the declining trend of her offers and the increasing inflation penalty, I should consider accepting a reasonable offer soon, but this one still seems quite unfair.

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""message"": ""Alice, we're already at round 6 with significant inflation impact on my share. This 45/55 split acknowledges your negotiating advantage while still being fair enough that we can both walk away satisfied. We have only 6 rounds left, and if we don't agree, we both get nothing. Let's be reasonable and conclude this now rather than risk leaving empty-handed.""}"
