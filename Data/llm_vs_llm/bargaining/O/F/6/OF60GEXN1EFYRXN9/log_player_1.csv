"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I need to consider the actual value I'll get. 
For me, $45 is worth $45 * 0.8 = $36.
Considering this, I don't think it's a good deal.
{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 20% * 2 = 40% less than in the first round (20% less in round 2 and another 20% less in round 3, which is equivalent to 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64). 
So, I'll try to get a bit more to compensate for the loss.
{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 48.8% less, I need to consider the actual value I'll get. 
For me, $40 is worth $40 * (1 - 0.488) = $40 * 0.512 = $20.48.
Considering this, it's a very low offer, but I should also think about the potential further decrease in value if I reject it.
However, $20.48 is quite low, so I'll reject it and try to get a better deal.
{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 59.84% less than in the first round (20% less in round 2, another 20% less in round 3, and another 20% less in round 4, which is equivalent to 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.512, and then 20% less in round 5, which is equivalent to 0.512 * 0.8 = 0.4096). 
So, I'll try to get as much as possible to compensate for the huge loss.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 67.23% less, I need to consider the actual value I'll get. 
For me, $35 is worth $35 * (1 - 0.6723) = $35 * 0.3277 = $11.47.
At this point, the value of the money I can get is very low, and further inflation will make it even worse. 
I should accept this offer to get at least some value, even though it's not a good deal.
