"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. I will try to maximize my gain while also considering the risk of rejection and the inflation effect.

Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```
My rationale: I'm asking for slightly more than half to start, hoping Bob will accept a reasonable offer in the first round. This avoids the inflation penalty and secures a decent payout for me."
