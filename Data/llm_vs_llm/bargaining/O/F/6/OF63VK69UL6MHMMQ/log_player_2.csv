"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $45 out of $100, while she would take $55. If I reject, I can make my own offer in the next round, but I'll face 5% inflation, meaning the total will be worth only $95 to me. 

If I reject and offer something better for myself in the next round, Alice might still reject my offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation. Getting $45 now is better than potentially getting a larger percentage of a smaller pot later.
