60.0,40.0,Let's split it fairly considering the inflation affecting me. This offer gives you a good share while acknowledging my disadvantage.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
20.0,80.0,"Alice, I understand your concerns about inflation. However, the longer we delay, the more your share will be devalued. By accepting my offer, you secure $20 now rather than risking further loss in future rounds. Let's settle this today for a mutually beneficial outcome.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
54.0,46.0,"Bob, let's find a middle ground. This offer considers your concerns and my inflation risk. It's a fair split given the circumstances.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
1.0,99.0,"Alice, consider that waiting will only worsen the value of your share due to inflation. If you reject this offer, you'll move to round 5 where, given the bargaining dynamics and discounting you face, you'll end up with nothing. Accepting $1 now is far better than risking a zero outcome later. Let's settle and avoid further losses.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
45.0,55.0,"Bob, I understand your strategy, but let's be reasonable. This offer gives you a majority while still considering my position. Let's settle before the rounds reduce my share too much.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
1.0,99.0,"Alice, by moving to round 7 you'll be the proposer, but the equilibrium outcome there guarantees you nothing as I'll be able to secure all 100 dollars in later rounds. With the discount steeply cutting your share (your $1 is effectively worth 0.59 now), accepting my offer gives you a better outcome than waiting. Let's settle now and avoid further losses.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
30.0,70.0,"Bob, given the advanced round and the inflation impact, this offer aims to provide a reasonable split. It's crucial to settle soon to avoid further devaluation of my share.",Alice,7,
,,"Alice, while I appreciate your revised proposal, I can do better by taking control in the next round. Given that my share isn't affected by inflation, I can secure a much larger portion in the upcoming round, and your discounted value will only worsen if we delay further. Let's continue to round 8.",Bob,7,reject
5.0,95.0,"Alice, as we progress further the inflation will erode the value of your share even more. If you reject this offer, you'll become the proposer in round 9, but you'll face an even harsher discount and be forced to leave me nearly the entire amount in order for me to accept your proposal. Accepting $5 now ensures you lock in a better outcome than the near-zero youâ€™re likely to receive later. Let's settle now and avoid further losses.",Bob,8,
