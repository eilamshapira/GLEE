Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns about inflation. However, the longer we delay, the more your share will be devalued. By accepting my offer, you secure $20 now rather than risking further loss in future rounds. Let's settle this today for a mutually beneficial outcome.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, consider that waiting will only worsen the value of your share due to inflation. If you reject this offer, you'll move to round 5 where, given the bargaining dynamics and discounting you face, you'll end up with nothing. Accepting $1 now is far better than risking a zero outcome later. Let's settle and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, by moving to round 7 you'll be the proposer, but the equilibrium outcome there guarantees you nothing as I'll be able to secure all 100 dollars in later rounds. With the discount steeply cutting your share (your $1 is effectively worth 0.59 now), accepting my offer gives you a better outcome than waiting. Let's settle now and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 1

}
```

I understand that the offer might seem low, but given the advanced round and the inflation impact, it's crucial to secure some value soon. By making this offer, I aim to find a middle ground that considers both our positions. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to reevaluate my strategy for the remaining rounds, considering the severe impact of inflation on my share."

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, as we progress further the inflation will erode the value of your share even more. If you reject this offer, you'll become the proposer in round 9, but you'll face an even harsher discount and be forced to leave me nearly the entire amount in order for me to accept your proposal. Accepting $5 now ensures you lock in a better outcome than the near-zero youâ€™re likely to receive later. Let's settle now and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95
