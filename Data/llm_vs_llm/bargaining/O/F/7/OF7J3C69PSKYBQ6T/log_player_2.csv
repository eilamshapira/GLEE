Round 2

Let's settle this today for a mutually beneficial outcome.""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 99, ""alice_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Alice, consider that waiting will only worsen the value of your share due to inflation. If you reject this offer, you'll move to round 5 where, given the bargaining dynamics and discounting you face, you'll end up with nothing. Accepting $1 now is far better than risking a zero outcome later. Let's settle and avoid further losses.""}"

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 99, ""alice_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Alice, by moving to round 7 you'll be the proposer, but the equilibrium outcome there guarantees you nothing as I'll be able to secure all 100 dollars in later rounds. With the discount steeply cutting your share (your $1 is effectively worth 0.59 now), accepting my offer gives you a better outcome than waiting. Let's settle now and avoid further losses.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 70 
# Alice gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your revised proposal, I can do better by taking control in the next round. Given that my share isn't affected by inflation, I can secure a much larger portion in the upcoming round, and your discounted value will only worsen if we delay further. Let's continue to round 8.""}"

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 95, ""alice_gain"": 5, ""message"": ""Alice, as we progress further the inflation will erode the value of your share even more. If you reject this offer, you'll become the proposer in round 9, but you'll face an even harsher discount and be forced to leave me nearly the entire amount in order for me to accept your proposal. Accepting $5 now ensures you lock in a better outcome than the near-zero youâ€™re likely to receive later. Let's settle now and avoid further losses.""}"
