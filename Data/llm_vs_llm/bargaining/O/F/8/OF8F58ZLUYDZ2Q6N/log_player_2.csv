"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly. I'll take 600k, you get 400k. Seems reasonable, right? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me in each round, I'll make a more favorable offer to myself to compensate for the potential loss.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""My turn! I'll take 550k, you get 450k. Don't let the money lose more value!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, since you rejected my fair offer, and inflation is eating away at our money, I'll propose this. I'll take 360k, and you get 640k. Take it or leave it, the money's losing value fast! 
# Bob gain: 640000 
# Alice gain: 360000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect on both of us, it seems Alice is taking a bigger hit. My offer would be worth more to me than Alice's, relatively speaking. Given the significant decrease in value for Alice and the fact that I get the larger share, I'll accept this offer.
