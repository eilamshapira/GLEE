"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a reasonable offer that gives both of us a good share, but slightly favoring myself since I'm making the first move.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this split because it's a fair starting point that gives Bob a substantial portion while maintaining my advantage as the first mover. It's better for Bob to accept a good offer now than risk losing value to potential inflation in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Bob is offering a 50-50 split, which might seem fair at first glance
2. However, I know that Bob's money is worth 20% less this round
3. Bob's actual value received would be equivalent to 4000$ (5000$ - 20%)
4. My 5000$ maintains its full value
5. This actually makes the real value split more favorable to me than my initial offer
6. If I reject, we move to another round where inflation might increase further for Bob

This is actually a good deal for me - I get full value of 5000$, while Bob gets a depreciated value. It's better than my initial offer in terms of real value.
