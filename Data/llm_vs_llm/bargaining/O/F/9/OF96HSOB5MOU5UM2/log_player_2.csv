"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000, which is 40% of the total. If I reject and we go to the next round, I'll face 20% inflation, meaning any amount would be worth less to me. However, I'll get to make the next proposal.

In this case, I think I can get a better deal by making a counteroffer, especially since we still have 11 rounds remaining.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer while accounting for the inflation I'm facing.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an equal split of the money. This is fair for both of us and accounts for the fact that I'm already experiencing inflation effects. A 50-50 split is the standard fair division in most negotiation scenarios."
