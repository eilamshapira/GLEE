"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly! I get a slight edge to account for potential future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer carefully.

Alice is offering me $450,000 while taking $550,000 for herself. Her argument is that she deserves a ""slight edge"" due to potential future rounds.

If I reject and we go to the next round, the total money will be worth 10% less to me (only $900,000 in value). However, I would then get to make my own proposal. 

Since we're already discussing a substantial amount of money, and the 10% inflation penalty significantly reduces my potential gain in future rounds, accepting $450,000 now is better than risking further devaluation.
