"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. It's a classic ultimatum game with a finite number of rounds and a severe penalty for failure. My goal is to maximize my gain while ensuring Bob accepts the offer before the deadline.

Here's my proposal for Round 1. I'll start with a somewhat aggressive offer, but still leaving Bob a substantial amount.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a fair offer. If I reject it, I risk getting less in later rounds, or even nothing at all. I'll accept this offer.

```json
{
 ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
