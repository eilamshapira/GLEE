"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

Alice has proposed:
- I get $400,000
- She gets $600,000

With 5% inflation per round, if I reject now and make a counter-offer in round 2, the total value will be worth 5% less to me (equivalent to $950,000 total value from my perspective).

I need to decide if I should accept this offer or propose something better in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more balanced while accounting for the inflation effect.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing an equal split of the money. This is fair to both of us, and I believe it's reasonable given that we both deserve an equal share of the amount. I understand there's 5% inflation for me each round, so it's in my interest to reach an agreement quickly."
