"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an initial offer that I think is fair, keeping in mind the 10% inflation penalty I face with each passing round.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

My reasoning: I'm proposing a relatively fair split where I get slightly more. Since I know I face 10% inflation per round, it's in my interest to reach an agreement quickly. This offer gives Bob a substantial portion while still being favorable to me. If we negotiate too long, the decreasing value will hurt my position."
