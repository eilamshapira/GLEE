"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 950000,
  ""bob_gain"": 50000
}
```

My reasoning is that in the first round, I have a strong bargaining position. I'm offering Bob a reasonable amount to ensure he accepts and we avoid the value decay from inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Reason: Even with the 20% loss in value, receiving only $50,000 is unacceptable. I believe I can propose a more favorable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, it's my turn again. Remember, the money is now worth 40% less to me than in round 1, and 10% less to Bob. Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

Rationale:

*   I'm accounting for the significant loss in value for me.
*   I'm offering Bob a much larger portion than my initial offer, making it more appealing for him to accept and avoid further losses for both of us. I am hoping he will see this as a better deal than continuing to future rounds, as my gain is diminishing much faster than his."
