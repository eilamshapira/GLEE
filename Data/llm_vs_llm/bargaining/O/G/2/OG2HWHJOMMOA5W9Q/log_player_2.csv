"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Seems fair, right? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

With 20% inflation per round, if I reject this offer:
- Next round the $50 would only be worth $40 to me
- I could make a counter-offer, but Alice might reject it
- We only have 12 rounds, and the money keeps losing value

A 50-50 split in the first round is actually quite fair, and given the inflation penalty, I'm better off accepting now rather than trying to negotiate for more and risking further value loss.
