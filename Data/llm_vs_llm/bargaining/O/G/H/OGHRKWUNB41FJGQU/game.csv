17.0,83.0,"Alice, I understand the importance of a fair deal, but waiting further hurts both of us – especially you, given the steeper discount. In round 2, with the current devaluation, I’m proposing $83 for me and $17 for you. This split mirrors our future prospects and ensures you get about what you’d expect if you waited (around $13.3 in discounted value), while avoiding additional erosion of the pie. I hope you agree this is a practical and fair compromise.",Bob,2,
