"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the importance of a fair deal, but waiting further hurts both of us – especially you, given the steeper discount. In round 2, with the current devaluation, I’m proposing $83 for me and $17 for you. This split mirrors our future prospects and ensures you get about what you’d expect if you waited (around $13.3 in discounted value), while avoiding additional erosion of the pie. I hope you agree this is a practical and fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 17 
# Bob gain: 83 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
