"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $40 while she gets $60. This is less than half for me, but I need to factor in the 10% inflation penalty per round. If I reject, the money will be worth less next round, but I'd get to make the counter-offer.

Let me evaluate: If I reject and propose in round 2, I'd face 10% inflation, so $100 would effectively be worth $90 to me. Even if I proposed a more favorable split next round, I've already lost some value.
