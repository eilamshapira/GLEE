"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $400,000 while she gets $600,000 of the $1,000,000 total. 

If I reject, I'll make a counter-offer in the next round, but I need to account for the 10% inflation penalty that affects me. My $400,000 now would be worth more than whatever amount I might secure in the next round after inflation.

While the split isn't perfectly even, $400,000 is still a substantial amount, and the inflation penalty creates risk in rejecting.
