549000.0,451000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a division that accounts for the 5% inflation penalty you face each round. If we wait until round 2, the total value to you drops by 5%. This split gives you slightly more than what you'd effectively get if you refused and made a counter-offer next round, making this a fair deal for both of us.",Alice,1,
