"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a proposal for dividing the $1,000,000 with Bob, considering the inflation factor.

""bob_gain"": 451000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a division that accounts for the 5% inflation penalty you face each round. If we wait until round 2, the total value to you drops by 5%. This split gives you slightly more than what you'd effectively get if you refused and made a counter-offer next round, making this a fair deal for both of us.""}"
