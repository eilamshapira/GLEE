"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a division that accounts for the 5% inflation penalty you face each round. If we wait until round 2, the total value to you drops by 5%. This split gives you slightly more than what you'd effectively get if you refused and made a counter-offer next round, making this a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 451000 
# Alice gain: 549000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
