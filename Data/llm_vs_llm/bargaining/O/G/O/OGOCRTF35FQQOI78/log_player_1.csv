Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first move and taking initiative. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the inflation and the fact that we're now in round 2, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This accounts for the decreased value of money and still offers you a significant share. Let's settle this quickly before the value drops further. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The reasoning behind accepting: Bob's offer is quite reasonable. While it's slightly in his favor, accepting now means we avoid further value loss from inflation. If I reject, we move to round 3 where the money would be worth another 5% less, and we risk getting into a back-and-forth that could leave us both with nothing. A guaranteed $45 now is better than risking further negotiations with decreasing value."
