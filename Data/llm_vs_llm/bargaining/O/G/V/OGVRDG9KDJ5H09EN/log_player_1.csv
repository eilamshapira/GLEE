"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a reasonable first offer that accounts for the 5% inflation penalty if we need additional rounds. A fair split with a slight advantage to me seems appropriate.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this division where I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000. This is a reasonable split that gives both of us a substantial amount while leaving room for negotiation if needed, though we'd both lose value due to inflation in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 487180 
# Bob gain: 512820 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
1. Bob is offering me $487,180 while taking $512,820
2. Due to 5% inflation, my $487,180 is actually worth $462,821 in original value
3. If I reject, we'll go to round 3 with another 5% inflation hit
4. My next offer would need to be very appealing to Bob to get accepted, and would be worth even less due to inflation

While this isn't as much as my initial offer, it's still a substantial amount, and rejecting would likely lead to both of us losing more value due to inflation. It's better to accept a slightly lower amount now than risk further depreciation.
