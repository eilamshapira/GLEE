Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

I'm rejecting this offer, even though it's slightly better than my previous offer to Alice. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing. While I don't know how inflation is affecting Alice, it's in my best interest to secure a reasonable amount sooner rather than later.
* **Negotiation Tactics:** By rejecting this offer, I'm signaling to Alice that I'm serious about getting a fair deal. I'm hoping she'll come back with a better offer in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

The effects of inflation are becoming more significant, and Alice is unlikely to offer me a better deal. Accepting this offer secures me a reasonable amount, even with the inflation considered."
