Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and early acceptance means we both avoid inflation losses.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you want a favorable split. Let's meet in the middle - I'm offering you 4500 and I'll take 5500. This is fair considering we're both facing inflation, and it's better to reach an agreement now before the money loses more value. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 36% less than in the first round, the $4500 I would gain is actually worth approximately $2880 (4500 * (1 - 0.36)).

Considering this, I think I can do better.
