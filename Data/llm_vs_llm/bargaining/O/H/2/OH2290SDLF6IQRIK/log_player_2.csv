"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of the $10,000, which is 40% of the total. If I reject and we go to the next round, I'll make a counter-offer, but the money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation.

If I reject, in the next round the $10,000 will effectively be worth $8,000 to me. Even if I were to get all of it (which is unlikely), I'd still be getting less value than the $4,000 being offered now.
