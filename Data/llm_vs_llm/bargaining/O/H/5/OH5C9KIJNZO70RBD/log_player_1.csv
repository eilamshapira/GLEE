Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I rejected your offer because I think I deserve a bit more. Let's split it 55-45, it's still a good deal considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The inflation penalty makes this a reasonable offer. If I reject, in the next round my share would be worth 10% less and we risk losing more value in subsequent rounds. A guaranteed $45 now (worth 90% of original value = $40.5) is better than risking further depreciation."
