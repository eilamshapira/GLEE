6000.0,4000.0,"I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering we both want to avoid inflation reducing the total value. If we keep going to further rounds, I'll lose money due to 5% inflation while you won't.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
200.0,9800.0,"Alice, as we move into later rounds your share faces another 5% devaluation while my share remains intact. To avoid further erosion of your value, I propose we settle now with me receiving $9800 and you receiving $200. Accepting now is in your best interest compared to the losses you’d incur in subsequent rounds.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
7000.0,3000.0,"Bob, your previous offer was extremely unfair. While I face inflation, that doesn't justify such an imbalanced split. I'm offering you a 70-30 split in my favor, which accounts for my inflation risk while still giving you a substantial amount. If you reject this, we'll both lose value through further negotiations.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
400.0,9600.0,"Alice, I understand your concerns about inflation—but the reality is that each round delays further erodes your share. At this point, your nominal $400 effectively becomes about $342 in round‐1 value. If we move to another round, that gap only grows worse for you due to nearly 14% devaluation. I'm offering you this $400 now so you can secure a better outcome than risking further losses. Let's agree and end this before more value slips away.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
8000.0,2000.0,"Bob, your predatory negotiation tactics won't work. Yes, I face inflation, but that doesn't justify you trying to take 96% of the pot. Even with the current 14.26% inflation impact, my $8000 offer still leaves me with more value than your lowball offers. If you continue to reject reasonable offers, we'll both lose out. This 80-20 split is my response to your unfair tactics - accept it or we continue, but I won't cave to extremely unfair proposals.",Alice,5,
,,"Alice, your proposal gives me $2000, while your $8000 will be worth 18.55% less than what it would have been in round 1. I believe we both stand to gain by shifting the negotiations back to me, where I can propose a division that minimizes your continued losses from inflation. I'm choosing to reject your offer so that we can avoid locking in a deal that unnecessarily shortchanges my position.",Bob,5,reject
100.0,9900.0,"Alice, with each round of delay your offer loses more value—by round 6, any money you receive is about 23.5% less valuable than in round 1. Accepting $100 now secures you roughly $76.50 in round‐1 value, whereas further negotiations will only worsen your outcome. I’m offering you this division to prevent additional losses from inflation. Let's settle now and stop the erosion of your share.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
9000.0,1000.0,"Bob, your increasingly predatory offers ($100? Really?) have forced this response. You're trying to exploit the inflation mechanic to pressure me into accepting scraps, but even with 22.62% inflation, my $9000 now (worth about $6964 in round-1 value) is far better than your insulting $100 offer. I'm now offering a 90-10 split. Your choice: take $1000 now or risk getting even less as I continue to counter your predatory tactics with increasingly aggressive offers.",Alice,7,
,,"Alice, I must reject this 90-10 proposal. While your money is losing value rapidly, my position remains strong. Accepting only $1000 isn’t optimal for me, and I believe I can secure a far better deal by continuing negotiations. Let's proceed to the next round so that I can put forward an offer that reflects the benefits I derive from the current inflation dynamics.",Bob,7,reject
50.0,9950.0,"Alice, as we enter round 8, the inflation is biting harder—your funds are worth roughly 30% less than their original value. If we continue, you'll see even further erosion of your share. I'm offering you $50 now, which secures you more value than if you waited and faced additional losses. Accepting this deal preserves as much of your value as possible under these conditions. Let's finalize this agreement now.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
9500.0,500.0,"Bob, your offer of $50 is absolutely ridiculous. Even with 30.17% inflation, my $9500 offer (worth about $6634 in round-1 value) is astronomically better than your insulting $50. You're not negotiating in good faith, so I'm now offering you just $500. Either accept this or watch your share continue to shrink as I respond to your predatory tactics with even more extreme counteroffers. The choice is yours.",Alice,9,
,,"Alice, your current offer gives me only $500 while your share takes a heavy hit from inflation. My portion remains at full value, and I’m convinced that further negotiations will allow me to secure a split that better reflects this advantage. I must reject your offer and continue the game.",Bob,9,reject
25.0,9975.0,"Alice, we’re now at round 10 and time is working against you. With every additional round, your allocated funds lose about an extra 4% of their round-1 value. Accepting $25 now safeguards you against further erosion, even though it might seem minimal—it’s worth about $15.75 in round-1 terms, far better than the near-zero value you’d face with continued delays. My share remains fully intact, and this is the best I can offer given the circumstances. Let’s settle now before your losses mount any further.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
9900.0,100.0,"Bob, your predatory tactics have reached new lows with that $25 offer. Let me be crystal clear: even with nearly 37% inflation, my $9900 now (worth about $6238 in round-1 value) is exponentially better than your insulting $25. I'm now offering you just $100. Your strategy of trying to wear me down with increasingly offensive offers has backfired spectacularly. Take the $100 or watch as your share approaches zero in my next offer. Your manipulative tactics have earned you this outcome.",Alice,11,
,,"Alice, accepting only $100 leaves me far short of what I can guarantee by continuing negotiations, as my share is not affected by inflation while yours is dwindling. If we proceed to the next round, your allocation will slip even more in round‐1 value, making your eventual position even less favorable. For both our sakes, I must decline this offer and propose a new division in the next round that better accounts for the disparities caused by inflation.",Bob,11,reject
10.0,9990.0,"Alice, by round 12 the effects of inflation have reached a point where every delay completely wipes out much of your value. Your offer—if you wait any longer—will be worth even less in today’s terms, and I’m offering you $10 now to preserve as much of your value as possible. This might seem insubstantial, but under the relentless devaluation you're facing, it’s considerably better than the rapidly diminishing alternatives. I urge you to accept this offer now to secure what remains of the pot.",Bob,12,
,,,Alice,12,reject
9950.0,50.0,"Bob, your $10 offer is beyond insulting. Even with 43.12% inflation, my $9950 now (worth about $5659 in round-1 value) dwarfs your pathetic offers. You're clearly hoping I'll break under the pressure of inflation, but I won't. I'm now offering you just $50. Your attempts to exploit the inflation mechanism have resulted in this outcome. Either accept this tiny share or watch it shrink further - I'm prepared to continue this game as long as necessary. Your predatory negotiation strategy has completely backfired.",Alice,13,
,,"Alice, your latest proposal of giving me only $50 while you pocket $9950—even after a 45.96% devaluation on your share—still doesn't come close to a fair reflection of my full-value standing in these negotiations. This offer continues to minimize my share drastically in favor of yours, which, while suffering inflation, doesn't change the fact that I'm set to secure a much better outcome if I keep steering the discussion. I must reject this offer and push for terms that genuinely account for the imbalance and my inherent advantage.",Bob,13,reject
20.0,9980.0,"Alice, we're now in round 14 and the pressure of inflation has further eroded the value of your share—it’s now worth roughly 50% less than in round 1. That means every dollar you have is effectively halved in its original value. In contrast, my share remains unaffected. I'm offering you $20 now, which, although it might seem trivial, ensures you preserve as much value as possible compared to the rapidly deteriorating alternatives if we delay any further. This is the most value you can salvage under these conditions, so I urge you to accept this division before your effective gains shrink even more.",Bob,14,
,,,Alice,14,reject
9975.0,25.0,"Bob, your $20 offer shows you're still not understanding the situation. Even with 48.67% inflation, my $9975 now (worth about $5120 in round-1 value) is vastly superior to your insulting offers. You seem to think inflation will force me to accept pennies, but you're wrong. I'm now offering you just $25. Your continued predatory behavior has earned you this minimal offer. The math is simple: even with severe inflation, I'm better off taking the vast majority of the pot than accepting your exploitative offers. Accept this $25 or watch your share continue to diminish - I'm fully prepared to continue this pattern indefinitely.",Alice,15,
,,"Alice, your offer of $25 for me while you secure $9975—even with a 51.23% devaluation on your money—is completely unacceptable. My share remains fully intact, and rejecting this paltry offer ensures I can continue to push for a division that better reflects the real value I hold in these negotiations. I refuse to accept an outcome where I end up with just $25 when I can guarantee a far superior result by continuing the game.",Bob,15,reject
5.0,9995.0,"Alice, at round 16 the relentless inflation has further eroded your share—it’s now worth about 57% less than the original value. Accepting $5 now guarantees you some vestige of value (roughly $2.15 in round-1 terms) rather than watching it evaporate in future rounds. This is the best I can do given the circumstances. Let's settle now before your share dwindles to nothing.",Bob,16,
,,,Alice,16,reject
9990.0,10.0,"Bob, your $5 offer is simply absurd. Even with 53.67% inflation, my $9990 now (worth about $4627 in round-1 value) is astronomically better than your insulting $5. You continue to miscalculate - even with severe inflation, I'm far better off taking 99.9% of the pot than accepting your exploitative offers. I'm now offering you just $10. This is the direct result of your predatory negotiation strategy. You can either accept this $10 or watch as your share approaches zero in future rounds. I'm perfectly willing to continue this pattern until you realize your strategy has completely failed.",Alice,17,
,,"Alice, your offer of $10 to me while you claim $9990 is simply not acceptable. Despite the inflation on your side, my money retains full value, and I must insist on a division that reflects that advantage. I reject this $10 offer and await a more reasonable proposal that accounts for the full value of my share.",Bob,17,reject
1.0,9999.0,"Alice, we're now at round 18 and your share continues to lose value with every passing moment. Although $1 might seem insignificant, it's guaranteed value in today's terms—far better than risking further devaluation if we continue this cycle. My own share remains unaffected, and I must insist that you accept this offer before your effective value drops to nothing. This is the best you can secure given the relentless inflation on your side—please accept this division.",Bob,18,
,,,Alice,18,reject
9995.0,5.0,"Bob, your $1 offer has reached new depths of absurdity. Let me explain this one final time: Even with 58.19% inflation, my $9995 now (worth about $4178 in round-1 value) is thousands of times better than your insulting $1. Your entire strategy has been fundamentally flawed from the start. I'm now offering you just $5. The outcome of your predatory tactics is that you're now faced with accepting virtually nothing or watching your share become even more microscopic. I will continue this pattern indefinitely - the inflation penalty is irrelevant when I'm taking 99.95% of the total amount.",Alice,19,
,,"Alice, offering me only $5 while you secure $9995—even with your inflation penalty—is entirely unacceptable. My share remains fully intact, and I'm not willing to lock in an outcome where I receive virtually nothing. I must reject this offer and continue negotiating for a more balanced division.",Bob,19,reject
0.0,10000.0,"Alice, we've reached the final round. Your ongoing rejections have ensured that your share has been eroded by inflation to the point of being effectively worthless. Any further delay guarantees that your portion will remain at or near zero value. Given that my share retains full value, I must now take the entire sum. Accepting this offer means you lock in a zero nominal amount before further devaluation occurs—it's the only rational outcome under these extreme conditions.",Bob,20,

9999.0,1.0,"Bob, your offer of $0 demonstrates the complete failure of your strategy. Even with 62.26% inflation, my $9999 now (worth about $3774 in round-1 value) remains vastly superior to zero. You tried to use inflation to force me into submission, but failed to realize that taking nearly all the money, even heavily discounted, is still far better than accepting your predatory offers. I'm now offering you $1. This is the bed you've made with your aggressive tactics - you can either accept this dollar or we can continue this pattern indefinitely. The inflation penalty becomes irrelevant when the split is this extreme.",Alice,21,

I'm rejecting this offer and look forward to presenting a counterproposal in the next round.",Bob,21,reject
0.0,10000.0,"Alice, by round 22 the relentless inflation has made your portion completely insignificant—any fraction you receive is effectively wiped out by the devaluation. Continuing this negotiation only guarantees further losses on your side, while my share remains at full value. This final offer of full retention of the pot is the only rational outcome when your effective gains have evaporated. Accepting this confirms that no further devaluation can affect you, as there's nothing left to lose.",Bob,22,

9999.0,1.0,"Bob, your strategy continues to fail spectacularly. Even with 65.94% inflation, my $9999 now (worth about $3405 in round-1 value) is infinitely better than your $0 offer. You seem unable to grasp that I can continue this pattern forever - the inflation penalty becomes meaningless when I'm taking 99.99% of the pot. I'm still offering you $1. Your choice remains the same: take this dollar or watch as we continue this cycle indefinitely. Your attempt to use inflation as leverage has resulted in you being offered virtually nothing, and that won't change.",Alice,23,
,,"Alice, your persistent offer of a single dollar while you claim almost the entire pot is utterly unacceptable.

I must reject this offer and continue pursuing a fairer division that truly reflects the value I retain in every round.",Bob,23,reject
0.0,10000.0,"Alice, by round 24 the relentless inflation has reduced the real value of any amount you receive to less than one third of its original worth, while my share remains fully intact. Any nominal sum added to your side only accelerates your devaluation. Therefore, I’m proposing that I take the entire $10000. Accepting this offer is the only rational option for you, as delaying further merely guarantees that your potential payout becomes even more insignificant.",Bob,24,

Let me be absolutely clear: I will NEVER accept your zero offers. Even if we continue for 100 more rounds with compounding inflation, taking 99.99% of $10000 will always be better than taking $0. I continue to offer you $1. Your failed strategy has painted you into this corner - either accept this minimal amount or we can continue this pattern indefinitely. The inflation penalty is irrelevant when the alternative is zero.",Alice,25,
,,"Alice, your offer of $1 in exchange for a nearly complete claim on the pot remains untenable. Despite your argument that inflation makes your share comparatively better even when discounted, my share retains its full value. Accepting a mere dollar does nothing to preserve the fairness of this negotiation.

The cycle of extreme devaluation on your side does not justify a deal where I receive almost nothing.",Bob,25,reject

Let me explain your miscalculation: Even if inflation reaches 99%, taking 99.99% of $10000 will ALWAYS be better than $0. You can't use inflation to force me to accept nothing when I can just take virtually everything. I'm still offering you $1.

Your fundamental error is thinking inflation can force me to take nothing when I can just take virtually everything. I continue to offer you $1.
