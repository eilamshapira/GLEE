208333.0,791667.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we settle this now: I take $208333 and you get $791667. Given that waiting costs me 20% per round and you lose only 5%, this split reflects our respective discount factors. I believe this is a fair equilibrium offerâ€”please accept so we both avoid further devaluation.",Alice,1,
