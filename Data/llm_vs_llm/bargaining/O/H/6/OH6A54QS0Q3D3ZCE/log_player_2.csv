"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we settle this now: I take $208333 and you get $791667. Given that waiting costs me 20% per round and you lose only 5%, this split reflects our respective discount factors. I believe this is a fair equilibrium offerâ€”please accept so we both avoid further devaluation. 
# Bob gain: 791667 
# Alice gain: 208333 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether I should accept this offer, let's analyze the situation.

In the first round, Alice offers me $791,667 and takes $208,333 for herself. This split seems to be based on the discount factors due to inflation, where Alice loses 20% of the value per round and I lose 5%.

Given that the total amount is $1,000,000, if I were to make a counteroffer or wait, I'd need to consider how the value decreases for both of us.

For me, the value decreases by 5% each round, meaning that if I don't accept this offer and we move to the next round, the total value I could potentially negotiate for would be 95% of $1,000,000, which is $950,000. However, since Alice's offer is based on an equilibrium that considers both our discount rates, rejecting this offer might not yield a better outcome in subsequent rounds, especially considering Alice's larger discount rate.

Let's calculate what happens if we go to the next round, assuming I make an offer then:

1. **Value after the first round for me (5% decrease):** $1,000,000 * 0.95 = $950,000
2. **Value after the first round for Alice (20% decrease):** $1,000,000 * 0.80 = $800,000

Considering Alice's significant loss in value per round, her initial offer seems to reflect a strategic attempt to find a mutually beneficial split early on, minimizing the impact of inflation on both parties.

Given this analysis, accepting Alice's offer might be the best choice to avoid further devaluation, especially since her offer does indeed seem to account for our differing discount rates.
