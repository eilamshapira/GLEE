"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Explanation:

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money is decreasing for me, so I need to aim for a larger share to compensate.
* **Bob's Position:** Bob's previous offer suggests he might be aiming for a slightly larger share than half. 
* **Compromise:**  My offer is a slight increase from his previous offer, aiming for a compromise while still getting a larger share to offset the inflation impacting me."
