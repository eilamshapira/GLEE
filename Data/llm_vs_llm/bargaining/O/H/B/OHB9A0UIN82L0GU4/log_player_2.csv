"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Reasoning: As Bob, I'll reject this offer since it's not a fair split and we're only in the first round. The 60-40 split in Alice's favor isn't justified. Since the penalty for waiting is 20% per round, I can make a counter-offer in the next round where the total amount will be 8,000$. This gives me leverage to propose a more equitable distribution."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

Reasoning: I'll propose a fair 50-50 split of the remaining money (8,000$ due to 20% inflation after round 1). This would give each of us 4,000$, but I'll express it in terms of the original 10,000$ amount as requested. A 50-50 split is fair and reasonable, and Alice should recognize that rejecting this offer would lead to further depreciation of the total amount, making us both worse off in subsequent rounds."
