"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I get slightly more to compensate for the higher inflation rate I'm facing. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $45 while taking $55
2. If I reject, we move to round 2 where:
   - My $45 would be worth 20% less ($36)
   - Her $55 would be worth 10% less ($49.50)
3. The difference in inflation rates does favor her argument for a slightly higher share
4. However, I'll have the power to make the next offer if I reject
5. But there's risk in rejection as the money loses value each round

Given that this is a relatively fair opening offer that accounts for the inflation difference, and considering the significant value loss in future rounds, I think it's best to accept.
