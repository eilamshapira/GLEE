"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my proposal for Round 1, keeping in mind the looming inflation:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

**Explanation of my reasoning:**

*   **Slightly Favored:** I'm proposing a slightly larger share for myself. I'm taking on the initial risk and hope Bob will accept to avoid the looming inflation.
*   **Fair Enough:** Bob still gets a significant amount ($4500). This isn't a take-it-or-leave-it offer, and I hope he sees it as a reasonable starting point.
*   **Avoiding Extremes:** I'm avoiding an extreme offer that would likely be rejected outright. I want to establish a foundation for negotiation, if necessary.

I am ready to receive Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to analyze Bob's offer, taking inflation into account, and then decide whether to accept or reject.

*   **My Initial Amount:** $10,000
*   **My Round 1 Offer:** $5,500
*   **Bob's Round 2 Offer:** $4,750

**Considering Inflation:**

*   **Value of $4,750 to me in Round 2:** Since my money is worth 10% less in round 2, the inflation impact to me is 10%.

**Decision:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm going to reject it, I believe I could get a better deal.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's my turn to make an offer again. Inflation is biting, so I need to consider that carefully.

**Inflation Considerations:**

*   **Alice's Inflation:** Money is now worth 20% less than in Round 1.
*   **Bob's Inflation:** Money is now worth 10% less than in Round 1.

My goal is to make an offer that's more appealing to Bob while still securing a worthwhile amount for myself, given the inflation. I'll slightly increase Bob's share from my original offer, but not by too much.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5300,
  ""bob_gain"": 4700
}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **Slight Concession:** I'm conceding a bit more to Bob than in Round 1, acknowledging his rejection.
*   **Inflation Adjustment:**  Even with a slightly lower amount, the inflation is hurting *both* of us. This amount should still be appealing to me, considering the declining value.
*   **Hope for Agreement:** I'm aiming for a balance that encourages Bob to accept, rather than continuing down a path where the money becomes increasingly less valuable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze Bob's offer carefully.

*   **My Initial Amount:** $10,000
*   **Bob's Round 4 Offer:** Alice gets $5200, Bob gets $4800
*   **My Inflation:** 27.1% less than Round 1
*   **Bob's Inflation:** 14.26% less than Round 1

This is getting serious with the inflation. Let's consider the value I'm getting with Bob's current offer compared to previous ones.

**Decision:**

I will accept the deal. This is the best way to ensure that I will get the money before it loses value.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
