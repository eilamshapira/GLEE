"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Alice in each round, I'll take that into account for my offer.

For me (Bob), the money is now worth $10,000 * 0.95 = $9,500.
For Alice, the money is now worth $10,000 * 0.9 = $9,000.

Considering this, my offer is:
{""bob_gain"": 5250, ""alice_gain"": 4750}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll calculate the actual value of the offer.

The original amount was $10,000. With 9.75% less value for me, the amount is now worth $10,000 * 0.9025 = $9,025.
With 19% less value for Alice, the amount is now worth $10,000 * 0.81 = $8,100.

Alice's offer is $4,700 for me and $5,300 for her. Given the decreased value, my share would be $4,700 / $9,025 ≈ 0.521 (or 52.1% of the decreased total value), and Alice's share would be $5,300 / $8,100 ≈ 0.654 (or 65.4% of her decreased total value).

I'll reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth even less now.

For me (Bob), the money is now worth $10,000 * 0.9025 * 0.95 = $8,573.75 (since it was 0.95 in round 2 and now another 5% less).
For Alice, the money is now worth $10,000 * 0.81 * 0.9 = $7,290 (since it was 0.9 in round 2 and now another 10% less).

My offer will take into account the decreased value for both of us.
