"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to make an offer to Bob, keeping in mind the decreasing value of the money for both of us with each round.

Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

My reasoning: I'm trying to secure a larger portion upfront, anticipating the money's value will decrease for me faster than I'd like. I'm giving Bob a significant amount, hoping he'll find it acceptable rather than risk further devaluation on his end as well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Let's analyze the offer, taking inflation into account:

*   **My perspective:** $5200 now is worth 5% less than in Round 1. So, it's like receiving $5200 * 0.95 = $4940 in Round 1 dollars.

*   **Bob's perspective:** He's offering himself $4800, which is worth 20% less to him than in Round 1. So, it's like receiving $4800 * 0.8 = $3840 in Round 1 dollars.

While his offer is closer to a 50/50 split than my initial proposal, I am willing to accept it.
