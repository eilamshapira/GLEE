8800.0,1200.0,"Alice, I appreciate your proactive start. However, waiting another round costs me due to inflation – every minute counts on my end. To avoid further devaluation (and to keep this process swift), I’m proposing 8800 for you and 1200 for me. I think it's a reasonable split that rewards your initiative while acknowledging my loss from delay. Let's settle now and save ourselves the hassle of further rounds.",Bob,2,

7800.0,2200.0,"Okay Bob, since you didn't accept my generous initial offer, I'm adjusting based on the time. Given the inflation on my side, and the slight devaluation you mentioned, I'm willing to come closer to a 78/22 split this time. Let's wrap it up here.",Alice,3,
