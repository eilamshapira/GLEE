"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your proactive start. However, waiting another round costs me due to inflation – every minute counts on my end. To avoid further devaluation (and to keep this process swift), I’m proposing 8800 for you and 1200 for me. I think it's a reasonable split that rewards your initiative while acknowledging my loss from delay. Let's settle now and save ourselves the hassle of further rounds. 
# Alice gain: 8800 
# Bob gain: 1200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
