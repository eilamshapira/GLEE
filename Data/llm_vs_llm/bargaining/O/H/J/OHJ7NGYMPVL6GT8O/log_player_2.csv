Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think a fair start is for me to get the majority, as I'm the one making the offer first. Let's get this done and over with!

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 1200, ""alice_gain"": 8800, ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your proactive start. However, waiting another round costs me due to inflation – every minute counts on my end. To avoid further devaluation (and to keep this process swift), I’m proposing 8800 for you and 1200 for me. I think it's a reasonable split that rewards your initiative while acknowledging my loss from delay. Let's settle now and save ourselves the hassle of further rounds.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, since you didn't accept my generous initial offer, I'm adjusting based on the time. Given the inflation on my side, and the slight devaluation you mentioned, I'm willing to come closer to a 78/22 split this time. Let's wrap it up here. 
# Bob gain: 2200 
# Alice gain: 7800
