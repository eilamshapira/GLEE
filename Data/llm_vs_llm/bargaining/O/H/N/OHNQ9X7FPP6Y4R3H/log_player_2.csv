"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I'd like to propose a more balanced distribution that recognizes both our contributions. I offer you $400,000 while I take $600,000. This is much fairer than the previous offer, and considering the 10% inflation penalty I face each round, it's reasonable for us to reach an agreement now."
