Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's reverse the split a bit to 55/45 this time. Considering the inflation rate differences, I think this is fairer for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
