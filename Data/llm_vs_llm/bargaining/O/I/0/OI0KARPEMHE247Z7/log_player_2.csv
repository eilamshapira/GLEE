"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split it 60/40. This is a fair offer, and avoids further inflation risk for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether accepting 40% of the pot is better than rejecting and making my own offer, keeping in mind that inflation will reduce the value by 10% if I reject.

If I reject, in the next round I'd be able to propose my own split, but the total would only be worth 90% of the original value to me. This means I'd need to get more than 44.4% of the pot (40/0.9) in the next round to make rejecting worthwhile.

Given that I don't know how inflation affects Alice, and there's a risk she might reject my counter-offer leading to further rounds and more inflation, accepting 40% now might be the safer option.
