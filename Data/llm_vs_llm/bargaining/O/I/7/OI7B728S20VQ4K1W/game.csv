6000.0,4000.0,"Let's split it fairly, 60/40 seems reasonable",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
2262.0,7738.0,"Alice, considering that if we continue the game your next move will let you secure almost the entire pot, I must offer you at least what you’d expect by waiting. In equilibrium analysis, you’d get about $2262 if you wait until round 3. To avoid further rounds (and my discount loss), I propose 7738 for me and 2262 for you. I hope you'll agree to this division.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
7000.0,3000.0,"Bob, your loss due to inflation is adding up. Let's settle this before it's too late for you",Alice,3,
,,"Alice, I understand your concern about the erosion of my share due to inflation. However, I believe that rejecting this offer will allow me to propose a division in the following round that will better reflect the discounted value I require. I'm confident we can come to a mutually acceptable agreement in the next round if we continue the negotiation.",Bob,3,reject
1865.0,8135.0,"Alice, if we look ahead, your best alternative in round 5 would net you about $1865 in nominal dollars. Since waiting only leaves you with that amount while avoiding any discount (unlike the further erosion I face), I’m offering you $1865 now and taking $8135 for myself. I believe this split reflects the equilibrium outcome when we factor in my discounting loss, and it’s in both our interests to settle here. I hope you agree.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
8500.0,1500.0,"Bob, your losses are piling up. If you don't accept this offer, you'll be leaving even more money on the table due to inflation. Let's end this before it's too late",Alice,5,
,,"Alice, I appreciate your concern about the inflation hitting my share, but receiving a nominal $1500 in round 5 translates to only about $1221 in round‑1 value for me after the 18.55% discount. Given that if I wait until round 6, I can propose a division that—when accounting for my further discount—will leave me with a considerably higher effective payoff, I must reject your offer.",Bob,5,reject
1417.0,8583.0,"Alice, if you reject this offer, you'll have the chance to propose in round 7, where you'll secure about $1417 in your pocket. To save both time and the further erosion of my value due to inflation, I'm proposing that you receive $1417 and I take $8583. I believe this division is fair given your alternative, and I hope you'll agree to settle now.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
9000.0,1000.0,"Bob, you're running out of time and value. If you don't accept this offer, you'll be left with almost nothing due to inflation. This is your last chance to get a somewhat decent share",Alice,7,
,,"Alice, your offer nets me a nominal $1000, which after a 26.49% discount is worth roughly $735 in round‑1 terms. If I reject and move to round 8, I will be in a position to propose a division that secures me a much higher effective payoff—even though further rounds incur additional discounts, my equilibrium continuation value is considerably better than $735. For that reason, I must reject your offer.",Bob,7,reject
978.0,9022.0,"Alice, consider that if you reject this offer, you'll have the opportunity to propose in round 9. In equilibrium, you would be able to secure about $978 for yourself in nominal terms. To avoid further rounds and the additional discounting that would reduce my effective value, I'm offering you exactly $978 now. I believe this division reflects our respective continuation values. I hope you agree to settle today.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
9500.0,500.0,"Bob, you're almost out of time and your money is worth less than a third of what it was initially. If you don't accept this offer, you'll be left with virtually nothing. This is your last chance to get any significant value",Alice,9,
,,"Alice, your offer gives me a nominal $500, which—after accounting for the 33.66% discount—boils down to roughly $332 in round‑1 value. If I reject, I get to propose in the next round, and my equilibrium continuation value will be considerably higher even when factoring in any further discounting. For that reason, I must reject this offer.",Bob,9,reject
514.0,9486.0,"Alice, by continuing the game you'll secure about $514 (in round-1 value) in your next turn as proposer. In this round, my proposal gives you exactly that amount, while I retain the rest. Given that my share now—though discounted by 0.95^(9) to roughly $5980 in round-1 value—is better than what I'd receive if we continue, I believe this division reflects our respective alternatives. I hope you'll agree to settle here.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
9800.0,200.0,"Bob, you're running out of options and your money is almost worthless. If you don't accept this offer, you'll be left with essentially nothing. This is your last chance to get any value at all",Alice,11,
,,"Alice, your offer gives me a nominal $200, which, after the 40.13% discount, is worth only about $120 in round‑1 value. If I reject, I move to round 12, where as the proposer I can claim almost the entire $10000—even though it will be subject to further discounting, it still results in a much better effective payoff for me. For that reason, I must reject your offer.",Bob,11,reject
1.0,9999.0,"Alice, this is the final round. If you reject, neither of us gets anything. Since your payoff remains undiminished by inflation and your alternative is $0, I’m offering you $1 to secure your agreement. This ensures you get something rather than nothing, while I maximize my share. I hope you'll accept this final proposal.",Bob,12,
