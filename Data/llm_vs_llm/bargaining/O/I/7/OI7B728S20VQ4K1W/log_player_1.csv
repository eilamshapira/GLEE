"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60/40 seems reasonable""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering that if we continue the game your next move will let you secure almost the entire pot, I must offer you at least what you’d expect by waiting. In equilibrium analysis, you’d get about $2262 if you wait until round 3. To avoid further rounds (and my discount loss), I propose 7738 for me and 2262 for you. I hope you'll agree to this division. 
# Alice gain: 2262 
# Bob gain: 7738 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to use game theory to his advantage.

However, I don't think his offer is fair, considering I'm not losing any value due to inflation. I'd like to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Now it's my turn again. Considering Bob's previous offer and the fact that the money is worth 10% less to him now (5% less in each of the two rounds), I'll make a new proposal.

{""alice_gain"": 7000, 
""bob_gain"": 3000, 
""message"": ""Bob, your loss due to inflation is adding up. Let's settle this before it's too late for you""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, if we look ahead, your best alternative in round 5 would net you about $1865 in nominal dollars. Since waiting only leaves you with that amount while avoiding any discount (unlike the further erosion I face), I’m offering you $1865 now and taking $8135 for myself. I believe this split reflects the equilibrium outcome when we factor in my discounting loss, and it’s in both our interests to settle here. I hope you agree. 
# Alice gain: 1865 
# Bob gain: 8135 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to use the same logic as before, but I'm not convinced.

His offer is still quite low, and I think I can get a better deal if I wait a bit longer. The fact that the money is worth significantly less to him now (14.26% less) gives me an advantage in the negotiation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Now it's my turn again. Considering Bob's previous offer and the fact that the money is worth even less to him now, I'll make a new proposal that takes into account his increasing losses due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 8500, 
""bob_gain"": 1500, 
""message"": ""Bob, your losses are piling up. If you don't accept this offer, you'll be leaving even more money on the table due to inflation. Let's end this before it's too late""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, if you reject this offer, you'll have the chance to propose in round 7, where you'll secure about $1417 in your pocket. To save both time and the further erosion of my value due to inflation, I'm proposing that you receive $1417 and I take $8583. I believe this division is fair given your alternative, and I hope you'll agree to settle now. 
# Alice gain: 1417 
# Bob gain: 8583 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is still quite low, and I think I can do better.

The fact that the money is worth 22.62% less to him now gives me a significant advantage in the negotiation. I'm not willing to accept such a small share, especially since the money is still worth its full value to me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Now it's my turn again. Considering Bob's previous offer and the fact that the money is worth even less to him now, I'll make a new proposal that reflects his increasing losses due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 9000, 
""bob_gain"": 1000, 
""message"": ""Bob, you're running out of time and value. If you don't accept this offer, you'll be left with almost nothing due to inflation. This is your last chance to get a somewhat decent share""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, consider that if you reject this offer, you'll have the opportunity to propose in round 9. In equilibrium, you would be able to secure about $978 for yourself in nominal terms. To avoid further rounds and the additional discounting that would reduce my effective value, I'm offering you exactly $978 now. I believe this division reflects our respective continuation values. I hope you agree to settle today. 
# Alice gain: 978 
# Bob gain: 9022 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is still extremely low, and I'm not willing to accept it.

The fact that the money is worth 30.17% less to him now is a significant advantage for me, and I believe I can negotiate a better deal. Accepting this offer would mean giving up a large portion of the value, which I'm not willing to do.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Now it's my turn again. Considering Bob's previous offer and the fact that the money is worth even less to him now, I'll make a new proposal that reflects his increasing losses due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 9500, 
""bob_gain"": 500, 
""message"": ""Bob, you're almost out of time and your money is worth less than a third of what it was initially. If you don't accept this offer, you'll be left with virtually nothing. This is your last chance to get any significant value""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, by continuing the game you'll secure about $514 (in round-1 value) in your next turn as proposer. In this round, my proposal gives you exactly that amount, while I retain the rest. Given that my share now—though discounted by 0.95^(9) to roughly $5980 in round-1 value—is better than what I'd receive if we continue, I believe this division reflects our respective alternatives. I hope you'll agree to settle here. 
# Alice gain: 514 
# Bob gain: 9486 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is still extremely low, and I'm not willing to accept it.

The fact that the money is worth 36.98% less to him now is a significant advantage for me, and I believe I can negotiate a better deal. Accepting this offer would mean giving up a large portion of the value, which I'm not willing to do.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Now it's my turn again. Considering Bob's previous offer and the fact that the money is worth even less to him now, I'll make a new proposal that reflects his increasing losses due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 9800, 
""bob_gain"": 200, 
""message"": ""Bob, you're running out of options and your money is almost worthless. If you don't accept this offer, you'll be left with essentially nothing. This is your last chance to get any value at all""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 43.12% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is the final round. If you reject, neither of us gets anything. Since your payoff remains undiminished by inflation and your alternative is $0, I’m offering you $1 to secure your agreement. This ensures you get something rather than nothing, while I maximize my share. I hope you'll accept this final proposal. 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 9999 
Do you accept this offer?","This is the final round, and I don't want to end up with nothing.

Although Bob's offer is extremely low, it's better than getting no money at all. I'll have to accept this offer, even though it's not a good deal for me.
