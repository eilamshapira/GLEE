I hope you'll agree to this division.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

I believe this split reflects the equilibrium outcome when we factor in my discounting loss, and it’s in both our interests to settle here. I hope you agree.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
