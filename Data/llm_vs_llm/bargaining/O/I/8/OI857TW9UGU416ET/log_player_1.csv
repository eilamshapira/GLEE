"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to conclude this quickly to avoid inflation eating into our gains.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55-45 split. I think this is a reasonable offer to share the remaining value fairly. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think through this:

1. With 5% inflation for me, my $5,500 is actually worth: $5,500 * 0.95 = $5,225

2. In the next round, I could make another offer, but:
   - The money would be worth another 5% less for me
   - I risk Bob rejecting again
   - Even if I propose a better split for myself, the inflation would eat into those gains

3. $5,225 is still a significant portion of the total, and better than risking further devaluation

Therefore, I'll accept this offer.
