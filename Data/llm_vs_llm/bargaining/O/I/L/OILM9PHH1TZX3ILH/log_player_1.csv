Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, since you face a 10% penalty each round and I don't, this is actually a fair offer. If you reject, your share will be worth even less next round. Let's make a deal now that works for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
