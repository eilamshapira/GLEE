"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, Bob. I'll take 6000 and you get 4000.  We get to keep something, and this keeps us from losing out to the next round! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me $4000, while taking $6000 for herself. This isn't an equal split, and I know that:
1. If I reject, I can make the next offer
2. Alice faces a 10% penalty per round, while I don't face any penalty
3. We have plenty of rounds left

Since Alice's money loses 10% value each round, she has more incentive to reach a deal quickly. If I reject this and make a counter-offer, she'll be more likely to accept a better deal for me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice loses 10% value each round and I don't, I have some leverage. However, I don't want to be too aggressive as we still need her agreement. I'll propose a more balanced split in my favor.

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, since you face a 10% penalty each round and I don't, this is actually a fair offer. If you reject, your share will be worth even less next round. Let's make a deal now that works for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I know inflation is hitting me harder, but I still think we can do better. I propose 5500 for me, 4500 for you.  Let's end this here and keep our money. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice is offering me $4500, which is $500 more than her first offer
2. Due to inflation, her $5500 is actually worth only $4455 (81% of $5500) to her
3. My $4500 maintains full value since I don't face inflation
4. If I reject, her next round will face even more inflation (29%)
5. However, we're already in round 3, and continuing too long risks both of us getting nothing

Given that Alice has moved significantly from her initial position and the offer is reasonable considering the circumstances, plus the risk of prolonged negotiation, I'll accept this offer.
