  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split the money 55/45. This gives me a slight advantage, accounting for potential inflation over time, but still leaves you with a significant portion. Let me know what you think!""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose a 48/52 split. This way, we both get a fair share considering the inflation situation. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
