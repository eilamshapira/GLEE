"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Looking at Alice's offer, I'd get $400,000 while she'd get $600,000 of the $1,000,000. 

If I reject this and make a counter-offer in the next round, I have to consider that the money will be worth 10% less to me (so the $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $900,000 to me). For Alice, the money would be worth 5% less (so $950,000 to her).

Since I can make a better offer in the next round that could still be attractive to Alice given our different inflation rates, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I'm making the offer now, I need to consider our different inflation rates. The money is now worth 10% less to me and 5% less to Alice compared to round 1.

A fair split would account for these different rates while being attractive enough for Alice to accept rather than continuing to another round where she'd face further depreciation.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing an equal split of the money. This is fair and reasonable, giving us both the same amount. If Alice rejects this, she'll face 5% inflation in the next round, which would reduce her potential gain. This equal division respects both of our interests and prevents further devaluation of the total amount."
