"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a reasonable offer that gives both of us a good share while being slightly in my favor.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

This is a fair proposal where I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500, giving me a small advantage as the first mover but still leaving Bob with a substantial amount. It's close enough to a 50-50 split that it should be acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Bob's offer gives them $6,000 and me $4,000. However, due to 20% inflation on Bob's side, their $6,000 is actually worth $4,800 in round 1 terms. My $4,000 maintains its value.

This is less favorable to me than my initial offer. Given that:
1. We still have many rounds left
2. My money doesn't lose value to inflation
3. I can make a counter-offer next round
4. Bob's money will be worth even less in the next round

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's money is now worth even less due to inflation, I can adjust my strategy. Bob has shown they want a larger nominal amount, but the inflation means I can offer them a higher nominal value while still maintaining good real value for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm offering a clean 50-50 split. While this appears perfectly equal in nominal terms, due to the inflation affecting Bob's portion, this actually gives me an advantage in real terms. The $5,000 Bob would get is worth less than $5,000 due to inflation, while my $5,000 maintains its full value. This should be more appealing to Bob as it's a higher nominal amount than my first offer gave them, even though the real value for them is lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

Bob offers me $4,200 (which maintains its full value) and they get $5,800.
However, due to 48.8% inflation on Bob's side, their $5,800 is actually worth only $2,969.60 in round 1 terms.

In real value terms:
Me: $4,200
Bob: $2,969.60

This offer is actually quite good for me, as I'm getting more in real value than Bob is. If I reject, we'll move to round 5, where Bob's money will be worth even less, but there's also risk in continuing to negotiate. Given that:
1. I'm getting more in real value
2. The $4,200 I would receive maintains its full value
3. We've already gone through 4 rounds
4. There's risk in continuing to negotiate
