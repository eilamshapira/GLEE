"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a somewhat favorable offer for me, but not too extreme since Bob might reject if it's too uneven. Since Bob faces 10% depreciation per round, he has some incentive to accept sooner rather than later.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this 60-40 split because:
1. It gives Bob a decent portion ($4000)
2. If Bob rejects, his next round's money will be worth 10% less
3. It's not so extreme that it would likely trigger an emotional rejection"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Bob is offering me $4500, which is less than my initial offer of $6000
2. Bob's offering himself $5500, but due to 10% inflation, it's only worth $4950 to him
3. If I reject, I can make a new offer next round
4. However, every round makes Bob's share worth less, which might make negotiations harder
5. This offer is fairly balanced, giving me 45% of the total

While I could reject and try to get more, this is a reasonable offer and prolonging negotiations might lead to less cooperative behavior.
