"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Alice is offering me 4000$ out of 10,000$, which is 40% of the total amount. While this isn't an even split, I need to consider:

1. If I reject, we move to the next round where I can make an offer
2. However, due to 10% inflation, my money will be worth less in the next round
3. After one round of inflation, my future gains would be worth 10% less
4. 4000$ now is better than a potentially higher nominal amount that's worth less due to inflation

Still, I think I can get a better deal. Even with inflation, I can propose a more favorable split in the next round. If Alice is rational, she should accept a reasonable counter-offer since she's not affected by inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me make a strategic offer.

Since Alice isn't affected by inflation but I am, I need to secure a good deal soon. However, I also need to make an offer that Alice would likely accept to avoid further rounds where my gains lose value.

I'll propose a more balanced split, but still slightly in my favor:

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

This is a fair offer because:
1. It's close to a 50-50 split
2. Alice still gets a substantial amount
3. If Alice rejects, she risks me offering less in future rounds if she makes unreasonable counter-offers
4. The split is reasonable enough that Alice should prefer accepting now rather than dragging out negotiations"
