"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose a 51/49 split in my favor.  We both get a good chunk, and we can end the game quickly. 
# Bob gain: 49 
# Alice gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $49 while she gets $51, which is close to an even split. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation, meaning the full $100 would only be worth $90 to me. 

Given that the split is fairly reasonable and inflation will reduce my value in future rounds, I should accept this offer.
