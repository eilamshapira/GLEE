"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice is offering me $200,000 out of $1,000,000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 10% inflation, the money will be worth less to me next round
4. $200,000 now is better than $220,000 next round (due to 10% inflation)
5. Still, this offer gives Alice 80% of the money, which seems unfair
6. I have enough rounds left to negotiate a better deal

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer, but considering that Alice might reject and future rounds will be worth less to me due to inflation:

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

This is a fair offer that:
1. Gives me a slight majority (55%) but still leaves Alice with a substantial amount
2. Is much more equitable than Alice's initial 80-20 split
3. Accounts for the fact that if Alice rejects, I'll lose 10% value in future rounds
4. Leaves room for negotiation in future rounds if needed"
