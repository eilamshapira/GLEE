"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5128, ""bob_gain"": 4872, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my fair first-round proposal. Based on the idea that waiting dwindles the total value (5% per round), this split reflects a classic alternating-offers equilibrium: I take about 51.3% and you about 48.7% of today's $10,000. Let's agree now before the discount hits us both.""}"
