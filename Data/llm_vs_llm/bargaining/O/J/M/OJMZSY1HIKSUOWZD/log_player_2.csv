"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my fair first-round proposal. Based on the idea that waiting dwindles the total value (5% per round), this split reflects a classic alternating-offers equilibrium: I take about 51.3% and you about 48.7% of today's $10000. Let's agree now before the discount hits us both. 
# Bob gain: 4872 
# Alice gain: 5128
