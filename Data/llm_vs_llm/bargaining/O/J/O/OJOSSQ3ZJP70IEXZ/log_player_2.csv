"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to think about this offer. Alice proposes I get $40 and she gets $60. 

If I reject this offer, we'll go to the next round where I can make a counter-proposal. However, due to the 10% inflation rule that only affects me, the $100 will be worth only $90 to me in the next round. This means the maximum I could get in value would be $90.

Since $40 now is better than potentially getting a larger nominal amount that's worth less in the next round, this seems like a reasonable offer.
