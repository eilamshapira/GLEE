"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. Since we're facing 10% inflation per round, accepting now maximizes our total value. If we go to another round, the pie shrinks to $900,000 total value for me, making further negotiation less profitable for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your point about maximizing the total value due to inflation. How about a split that's almost equal but slightly favors you to account for you proposing first? 
# Alice gain: 505000 
# Bob gain: 495000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
