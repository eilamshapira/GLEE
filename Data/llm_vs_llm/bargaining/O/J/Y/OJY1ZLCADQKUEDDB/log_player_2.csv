"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. Since we're facing 10% inflation per round, accepting now maximizes our total value. If we go to another round, the pie shrinks to $900000 total value for me, making further negotiation less profitable for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000
