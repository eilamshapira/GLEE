"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I need to consider that when evaluating the offer. 

The offer of 4500 is actually worth 4500 * 0.8 = 3600 to me, due to inflation.

Considering this, I think I can do better.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each round, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself to compensate for the inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of the offer to me, considering the inflation.

The offer of 5000 is actually worth 5000 * 0.512 (1 - 0.2)^2 = 2560 to me, due to two rounds of 20% inflation.

While it's an even split in nominal terms, the inflation has significantly reduced the value to me. However, I should also consider that further rounds will reduce the value even more.
