"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

This is a fair 50-50 split, but I need to consider the inflation effect. If I reject:
- Next round I can make an offer
- But the money will be worth 10% less to me
- Current offer is $50 for me
- Next round, even if I get more dollars, it might be worth less due to inflation

The 50-50 split is quite reasonable, and trying to negotiate for more comes with the risk of losing value through inflation. Better to secure a fair amount now than risk getting less value later.
