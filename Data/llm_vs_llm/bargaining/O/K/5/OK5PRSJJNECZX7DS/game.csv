50.0,50.0,"Hi Alice, thanks for your initial offer. Since we both face inflation (though possibly at different rates), I think a 50-50 split is the fairest approach. This way we both get an equal share, and we can conclude the negotiation quickly before inflation reduces the value further for both of us.",Bob,2,
