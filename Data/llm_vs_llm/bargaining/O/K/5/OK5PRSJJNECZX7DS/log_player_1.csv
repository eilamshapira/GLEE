"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's ensure we both benefit fairly. I'll propose 60 for me and 40 for you. This way, we both get something, and the impact of inflation on us is lessened. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your initial offer. Since we both face inflation (though possibly at different rates), I think a 50-50 split is the fairest approach. This way we both get an equal share, and we can conclude the negotiation quickly before inflation reduces the value further for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
