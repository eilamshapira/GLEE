"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's ensure we both benefit fairly. I'll propose 60 for me and 40 for you. This way, we both get something, and the impact of inflation on us is lessened. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll need to consider Alice's first offer carefully, keeping in mind the 5% inflation penalty per round.

If I reject and make a counteroffer in round 2, the total value will be worth 5% less to me. If we go back and forth several times, the decreasing value could significantly impact my share.

Alice's offer of $40 to me and $60 to her isn't completely balanced, but it's not terrible for a first offer. If I reject, I could propose a more favorable split next round, but the 5% inflation would reduce the total value.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that considers the inflation factor while seeking a more balanced distribution.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your initial offer. Since we both face inflation (though possibly at different rates), I think a 50-50 split is the fairest approach. This way we both get an equal share, and we can conclude the negotiation quickly before inflation reduces the value further for both of us.""}"
