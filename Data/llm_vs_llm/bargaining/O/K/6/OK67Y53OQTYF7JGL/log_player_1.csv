"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split that's slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer. I want to avoid multiple rounds due to the inflation penalty.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'll keep this first offer reasonable to have a good chance of acceptance. The 55-45 split acknowledges my first-mover position while still being fair enough that Bob might accept rather than risk inflation effects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me evaluate this:
- If I accept now, I get $45 with 5% inflation, so effectively $42.75
- If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, even if I get more dollars, it will be worth even less due to additional 5% inflation
- There's no guarantee Bob will accept my counter-offer
- We still have 10 rounds left, but the value keeps decreasing
- Bob's offer is fairly reasonable, close to 50-50

Given these factors, I'll accept this offer to secure a decent amount before inflation erodes more value.
