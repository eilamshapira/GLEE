"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice's offer gives me $4000, which is a substantial amount, it's not quite an equal split. However, considering that with each passing round, the money loses 5% of its value, I need to weigh the current offer against potential future negotiations.

If I reject and move to Round 2, the total amount would be worth $9,500 (5% less). Even if I proposed a 50-50 split then, I'd get $4,750 - only $750 more than the current offer. But Alice might reject that, leading to further depreciation.

Given the significant inflation penalty and uncertainty of future negotiations, I'll accept this offer.
