Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing an equal 50-50 split, which is fair to both of us. Since inflation doesn't affect me, I'm comfortable negotiating for a balanced division. This gives us both substantial value and respects our equal position in this negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000
