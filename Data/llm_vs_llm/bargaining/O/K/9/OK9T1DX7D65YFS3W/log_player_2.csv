"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I believe this is a fair split to start with. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer would give me $100,000 while she takes $900,000, which is a highly uneven split. Since I don't face any inflation penalty in future rounds, there's no rush for me to accept such an unbalanced division. I can make a counter-offer in the next round that would be more equitable.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""I'm proposing an equal 50-50 split, which is fair to both of us. Since inflation doesn't affect me, I'm comfortable negotiating for a balanced division. This gives us both substantial value and respects our equal position in this negotiation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: My previous offer was generous. This is the best I can do now. Take it or you'll get nothing. 
# Bob gain: 525000 
# Alice gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is now offering me $525,000 while she takes $475,000. This is significantly better than her first offer and actually gives me the majority share. Since I don't face any inflation penalties, and Alice appears to be facing increasing inflation costs with each round, this deal is now favorable to me.
