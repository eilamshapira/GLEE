"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I am offering you a generous split. Take it or leave it, Bob! 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me only $10 while keeping $90 for herself - that's a very uneven split
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, my money will be worth 20% less next round, while Alice's only decreases by 5%
4. Even with the inflation penalty, I could propose a more favorable split next round

This offer is too unfair. I'll reject it and make a counter-proposal next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a strategic offer:
1. Due to inflation, my share will be worth 20% less and Alice's 5% less
2. I should propose a more balanced split that Alice might accept
3. If she rejects, the next round will hurt me more than her
4. A 60-40 split in my favor might be reasonable given the inflation rates
