"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's split it fairly! I'm proposing $600k for me and $400k for you. This is a generous offer considering we only have 12 rounds and the money devalues with each round. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the rules. It's round 1, Alice is offering $400,000, and I need to consider the inflation.

Before I make my decision, let's calculate the value of $400,000 after accounting for inflation over the remaining rounds *if* I reject. This is a rough estimate, of course, since I don't know what Alice will offer later, or if we'll even make it to later rounds.

If I reject, I lose 20% of the value with each passing round. The worst-case scenario is rejecting all rounds and getting nothing.

Given that it is the first round, let us consider round 2 if I reject. If Alice proposes the same offer in round 2, that 400,000 will be worth 80%, so 320,000.
If I reject again in round 3, that will be (0.8)(320000) = 256000.
If I reject again in round 4, that will be (0.8)(256000) = 204800.
If I reject again in round 5, that will be (0.8)(204800) = 163840.
If I reject again in round 6, that will be (0.8)(163840) = 131072.
If I reject again in round 7, that will be (0.8)(131072) = 104857.6
If I reject again in round 8, that will be (0.8)(104857.6) = 83886.08
If I reject again in round 9, that will be (0.8)(83886.08) = 67108.864
If I reject again in round 10, that will be (0.8)(67108.864) = 53687.0912
If I reject again in round 11, that will be (0.8)(53687.0912) = 42949.67296
If I reject again in round 12, that will be (0.8)(42949.67296) = 34359.738368

Compared to that, 400000 in the first round is the highest amount that I will get, so I am better off accepting.
