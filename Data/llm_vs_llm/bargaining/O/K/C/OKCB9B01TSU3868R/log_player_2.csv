"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering we both lose money each round, but you lose more than me. Let's make a deal now and both walk away with a good amount! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is right that I lose more value per round (10% vs her 5%), which does put me at a disadvantage in negotiations. However, 60-40 is a significant difference.

If I reject and propose something like 50-50 in the next round:
- The total value will be worth 9000 for me (due to 10% loss)
- I could potentially get 4500, which is still better than 4000
- But Alice might reject, leading to further losses

Given:
1. The time pressure (12 rounds max)
2. My higher depreciation rate
3. The decent absolute value of $4000

While I could try to negotiate for more, the risks outweigh the potential benefits.
