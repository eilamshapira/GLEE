"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer that's fair while accounting for the inflation effect. Since I'll lose 5% of the value with each passing round, I should aim for a reasonable split that Bob would likely accept.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest this split because it gives me a bit more than half, which is fair considering I'm affected by inflation. If we move to another round, the total value decreases for me, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Bob is offering me $45 out of the $100, while taking $55 for himself.

Due to inflation, the $45 I would receive is worth 5% less than in the first round, so its effective value to me is $42.75.

If I reject and we go to round 3, I'll face another 5% inflation, meaning any amount will be worth even less to me. Meanwhile, Bob seems to be experiencing higher inflation (20%), which puts him under more pressure to settle.

Given that Bob rejected my initial 55/45 split and is now offering the reverse, and considering the compounding inflation effect if I reject, I'll accept this offer.
