"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","For the first round, I'll make a reasonable offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob with each passing round, it's in both of our interests to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. Considering this, I'll propose a split that slightly favors me to account for the risk of waiting, but still offers Bob a significant amount to encourage acceptance.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the offer from Bob, let's calculate the actual value considering the inflation:

- Original amount for me: $475,000
- Original amount for Bob: $525,000

Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob due to inflation:

- My actual gain: $475,000 * 0.95 = $451,250
- Bob's actual gain: $525,000 * 0.9 = $472,500

Considering this, the offer seems somewhat reasonable, but I need to think about the strategic aspect of accepting or rejecting. If I reject, the value of the money will decrease further for both of us, but I might be able to negotiate a better split in the next round.

However, given that the difference in value isn't drastically in favor of Bob after adjusting for inflation, and considering the risk of further devaluation, I think it's prudent to accept this offer to secure a significant amount rather than risking further negotiations.
