"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair offer to start the negotiation, considering the inflation effect.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose a 50-50 split of the $10,000, which gives us each $5,000. This is a fair division that respects both of our interests. I know that with each passing round, money becomes worth less to me due to 5% inflation, so I'm motivated to reach an agreement efficiently."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I notice that Bob is also affected by inflation, and at a higher rate than me (10% vs. 5% per round). Let me propose a slightly adjusted offer that acknowledges our different inflation rates. I'm offering you $4,500 while I take $5,500. This is reasonable considering the stronger inflation pressure you face, which makes reaching an agreement sooner more valuable for you than for me."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}

I see we're progressing through rounds with both of us facing increasing inflation penalties. Given that Bob's inflation rate is higher than mine (approximately 10% per round versus my 5%), I'm slightly adjusting my offer to be more accommodating while still securing a reasonable amount for myself. 

I'm offering Bob $4,800 while keeping $5,200 for myself. This is a fair compromise that recognizes both our positions and the fact that Bob has more incentive to reach an agreement quickly due to his higher inflation rate."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
