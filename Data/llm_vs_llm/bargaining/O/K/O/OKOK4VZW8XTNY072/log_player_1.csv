Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm proposing a much fairer split here. You still get the majority share, but it's a more reasonable distribution. Remember, if you reject, you'll make an offer next round, but I might need to ask for more to compensate for inflation. Let's make this deal now and both walk away happy. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
