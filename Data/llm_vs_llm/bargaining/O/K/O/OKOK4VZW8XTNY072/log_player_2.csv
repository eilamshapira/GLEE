"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a good chunk here. Take it or we'll play again and I'll have to take more. Let's settle this now! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $100,000 (10%) while keeping $900,000 (90%)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 10% inflation, any amount I get next round will be worth 10% less to me
4. To break even with the current offer in the next round, I would need to secure at least $111,111 to match the present value of $100,000
5. Alice's somewhat threatening tone suggests she might be less cooperative in future rounds
6. This is a very uneven split, and I can likely do better even accounting for inflation

Given these factors, I'll reject this offer. I can propose a more equitable split next round, and even with the 10% inflation penalty, I should be able to secure a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a more balanced offer while considering the inflation factor:

{""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm proposing a much fairer split here. You still get the majority share, but it's a more reasonable distribution. Remember, if you reject, you'll make an offer next round, but I might need to ask for more to compensate for inflation. Let's make this deal now and both walk away happy.""}

My reasoning:
1. I'm offering a more equitable split while still giving Alice a larger share
2. The 45-55 split is much fairer than the previous 10-90 split
3. My message emphasizes cooperation while subtly reminding about the inflation factor
4. I'm giving Alice a slight majority to make the offer more appealing
5. This offer balances fairness with pragmatism"
