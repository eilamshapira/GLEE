"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is proposing a split where I get $450,000 and she gets $550,000. This is slightly in her favor, but it's reasonably close to an even split.

I need to consider that if I reject, we move to the next round where I can make a counter-offer, but the total amount will decrease by 10% to $900,000. If I offer a more favorable split for myself in the next round, Alice might reject, leading to further devaluation.

Given that this is a reasonable first offer with just a modest advantage to Alice, I'll accept it rather than risk further devaluation.
