"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate this offer considering the game rules.

Alice is offering me $4,000 out of the $10,000 total, while she would get $6,000.

Since there's no inflation for me (0% less each round), there's no time pressure on my decision. I could potentially make a counter-offer in the next round if I reject this one.

Given that I don't know how inflation affects Alice, it's possible she might have some urgency to conclude the deal, though I can't be certain.

I believe I could propose a more balanced split in the next round, perhaps closer to 50-50.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more balanced while still being reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an even 50-50 split of the $10,000, which would give each of us $5,000. This is a fair division that treats both of us equally and should be acceptable to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's new offer considering the updated information.

Alice is now offering me $4,500 out of the $10,000 total, while she would get $5,500.

I now know that Alice is experiencing inflation - her gains are worth 19% less than in round 1. This explains why she might be more motivated to reach an agreement.

For me, there's still no inflation, so I don't lose value by continuing to negotiate. However, Alice has moved from her initial 60-40 split in her favor to a 55-45 split, which is more reasonable.

Given that:
1. Alice has made a significant concession
2. The offer is closer to a fair split
3. Alice is facing inflation pressure
4. Further negotiation might risk losing the deal entirely
