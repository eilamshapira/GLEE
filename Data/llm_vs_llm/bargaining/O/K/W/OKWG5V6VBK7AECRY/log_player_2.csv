"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing an even 50-50 split, which would give me $5,000 and her $5,000. This seems fair on the surface, but I need to account for the 10% inflation penalty per round that affects me.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2, the total value to me would be reduced by 10%. So even if I got more than $5,000 in the next round, it would be worth less to me due to inflation.

A bird in hand is worth two in the bush, especially with guaranteed inflation. An even split in the first round without any inflation impact is reasonable.
