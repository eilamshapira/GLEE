"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $4000 for me
2. If I reject and propose next round:
   * Money will be worth 20% less to me
   * Maximum I could get next round would be worth $8000 * 0.8 = $6400
   * But Alice might reject, leading to further rounds and more inflation

While 40% isn't an equal split, getting $4000 now is a guaranteed amount. If I reject, I risk getting less due to inflation in future rounds, even if I make a better proposal.
