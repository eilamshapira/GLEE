"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""My turn, let's be more reasonable, I take 55 and you take 45""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The value is decreasing Bob, let's close the deal. I take 55 and you get 45. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 45 is actually worth less than before. However, Alice's offer is still not in my favor. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Due to inflation, the money I gain is worth 9.75% + 5% = 14.75% less than in the first round, and the money Alice gains is worth 19% + 5% = 24% less than in the first round (assuming the same inflation rate applies to both of us for the decrease in value).

Considering this, I'll make a more favorable offer to myself.
