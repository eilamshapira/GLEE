600000.0,400000.0,Hi Bob! Let's split this fairly. I'll take $600000 and you get $400000. What do you say?,Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer! How about we try a 55/45 split? It's a bit more balanced.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
700000.0,300000.0,"Alright Bob, let's try this again. Considering the inflation, I'm proposing $700000 for me and $300000 for you. Take it or leave it!",Alice,3,

650000.0,350000.0,"Okay Bob, let's be realistic. Inflation is eating away at the value. I'll give you $350000, and I'll take $650000. I'm trying to find a point where we can both leave with something and not nothing.",Alice,5,
