# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000

This offer is even worse than her first one!  I need to signal I'm serious about getting a fair share."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's be realistic. Inflation is eating away at the value. I'll give you $350000, and I'll take $650000. I'm trying to find a point where we can both leave with something and not nothing. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is still a bad deal for me, even with inflation.  Alice is clearly trying to take advantage, and I need to hold out for a better offer."

# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close to the deadline. I'll offer the same split as the first round - $600000 for me and $400000 for you. This is one of my final offers. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is the same offer as her first, but with heavy inflation, it's better to take something now than risk getting nothing."
