"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money evenly. Fair is fair, right? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer is to split the money evenly, with each of us getting $50. This is a fair and standard division that gives us equal amounts.

Since this is just the first round, I could reject and make a counter-offer, but there's a 10% inflation penalty per round. If I reject, the total value decreases to $90 in the next round. Even if I tried to get more in round 2, the maximum possible would be $90, and my share would likely be less than $50 given Alice would need some incentive to accept.

An even split with no inflation penalty is reasonable, so I'll accept this offer.
