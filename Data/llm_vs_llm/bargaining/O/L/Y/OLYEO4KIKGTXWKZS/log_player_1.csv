"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but you still get a fair share. Let's settle this quickly to avoid inflation losses. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the fact that the money I gain is worth 10% less, I'll calculate the effective value of Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth 10% less for me, the $45 I would gain is effectively worth $45 * 0.9 = $40.5.

I'll reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each round, I'll try to make an offer that takes this into account.

In Round 3, the money I gain is worth 20% less than the original value (10% less in Round 2 and another 10% less in Round 3). So, if I offer myself $48, it's effectively worth $48 * 0.8 = $38.4 to me.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 48, 
""bob_gain"": 52, 
""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground before inflation eats away too much value!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a bit more, but let's end this soon so you don't lose too much value from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 44 
# Bob gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is worth 27.1% less, so the $44 I would gain is effectively worth $44 * 0.729 = $32.06.

I'll reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round, but I'm aware that the inflation is eating away at the value quickly.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each round, and it's already worth 30.9% less than the original value (10% + 10% + 10% = 30%), I'll try to make an offer that takes this into account.

In Round 5, the money I gain is worth approximately 30.9% + 10% = 40.9% less than the original value (using the rule of 10% less each round, but considering the compounding effect: 1 - (1 - 0.1)^5 ≈ 0.409). However, to simplify, I'll calculate the effective value as follows: the money I gain is worth 10% less than in Round 4, which was 27.1% less than the original. So, the new decrease is 10% of the remaining 72.9%, which is 7.29%. Adding this to the previous decrease: 27.1% + 7.29% = 34.39%. 

If I offer myself $42, it's effectively worth $42 * (1 - 0.3409) ≈ $42 * 0.6591 ≈ $27.64 to me, but using the correct decrease: $42 * 0.691 ≈ $29.02.

However, considering the correct calculation for the decrease:
1 - (1 - 0.1)^5 ≈ 0.409 or 40.9% decrease, 
$42 * (1 - 0.409) = $42 * 0.591 ≈ $24.81.

Here's my offer for Round 5:

{""alice_gain"": 42, 
""bob_gain"": 58, 
""message"": ""Time is running out, and inflation is taking its toll. Let's settle before it's too late!""}"
