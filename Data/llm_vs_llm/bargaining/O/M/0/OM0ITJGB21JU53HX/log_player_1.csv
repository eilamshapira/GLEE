Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose a 50-50 split which is completely fair to both of us. We'll each get $500000. This is equitable, and by accepting now, we avoid further depreciation of the total amount. Let's make a fair deal and both walk away happy. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
