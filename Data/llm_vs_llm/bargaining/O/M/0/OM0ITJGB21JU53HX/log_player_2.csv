"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40 in my favor to start. It's a fair offer considering the decreasing value of the money. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice wants a 60-40 split in her favor, giving me $400,000 and herself $600,000. While I could reject and make a counter-offer, I need to consider that the money loses 5% value each round. If I reject, we move to Round 2 where the total is worth $950,000.

This isn't an equal split, but $400,000 is still substantial, and avoiding the 5% inflation penalty has value. However, I believe we can reach a more equitable arrangement.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while acknowledging the time pressure we both face with the declining value.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I propose a 50-50 split which is completely fair to both of us. We'll each get $500,000. This is equitable, and by accepting now, we avoid further depreciation of the total amount. Let's make a fair deal and both walk away happy.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: How about a 55-45 split in my favor? It's still a good deal for you, and we can avoid further loss due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has improved her offer from 60-40 to 55-45, which means I would get $450,000 while she gets $550,000. This is more reasonable than her initial offer. 

I need to consider that we're now in round 3, and the money has already lost 9.75% of its value. If I reject, we'll move to round 4 where the money will be worth even less. While I could counter with another 50-50 proposal, the continued inflation makes accepting a reasonable offer more attractive.

$450,000 is still a substantial amount, and the difference between this and my ideal 50-50 split may not be worth the risk of further rounds and depreciation.
