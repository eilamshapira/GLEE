"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000
2. If I reject and we go to next round, the money will be worth 5% less to me
3. Next round I could propose something better, but Alice might reject
4. 60-40 split in Alice's favor is not particularly fair

While I could try for a better deal, the 5% inflation penalty makes rejecting risky. If Alice continues to reject future offers, my share could decrease significantly.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll take my chances and try to negotiate a more equitable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split, but I need to be strategic given the inflation factor affecting me.

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. This is more equitable than your previous offer, and we can both walk away happy.""}

This is a reasonable counter-offer because:
1. It's a perfectly fair split
2. If Alice rejects, the next round will cost me 5% value
3. Alice has no inflation penalty, so she might be tempted to drag this out
4. A 50-50 split is a common compromise in negotiation games"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a better deal for you than my first offer 
# Bob gain: 3900 
# Alice gain: 6100 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $3,900, which due to 9.75% inflation is actually worth $3,519.75 to me
2. This is worse than her first offer ($4,000)
3. If I reject, next round I'll face 14.75% inflation
4. The longer this goes, the weaker my position becomes due to inflation
5. Alice seems to be using the inflation factor strategically against me

Even though this isn't a great offer, my negotiating position is deteriorating with each round due to inflation. If I reject, any future gains will be worth even less to me.
