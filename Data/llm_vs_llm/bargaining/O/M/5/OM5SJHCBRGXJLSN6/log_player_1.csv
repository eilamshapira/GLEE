"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to make an offer to Bob, considering the dwindling value of the money for me with each passing round. I'll start with a relatively generous offer to increase the chances of acceptance early on.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob is being quite aggressive. My $60 in the previous round would be worth $54 now due to inflation. His offer of $45 is significantly lower. I need to decide if the risk of further inflation outweighs the potential for a better deal. Since it's still early in the game, I'll reject and try to negotiate a better offer later.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Alright, round 3. Inflation is starting to bite. My gains are now worth 20% less than at the start. I need to be realistic but also aim for a reasonable share. I'll offer a slightly more conciliatory split, but still prioritizing my gain.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob is really trying to squeeze me. Inflation is hitting hard now. My original $60 is now worth only $43.74. Bob's offer of $42 is getting close to my inflated value, and the rounds are ticking down. However, I'm worried about further concessions if I reject. I'll accept this offer before inflation eats away even more.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
