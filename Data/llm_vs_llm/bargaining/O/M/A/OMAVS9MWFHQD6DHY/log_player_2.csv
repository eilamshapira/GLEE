"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $3,000 while she gets $7,000 of the $10,000 total. 

If I reject, I'll get to make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation. That means the total effective value to me would be $9,500 in the next round.

Since I can make a more favorable counter-offer in the next round (even accounting for the 5% inflation), I should reject this initial offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more balanced counter-offer, taking into account the 5% inflation I've already experienced.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering a split where I receive $5,500 and Alice receives $4,500. This is a fair division that gives me a majority share to compensate for the inflation I've already incurred, while still giving Alice a substantial portion. This balanced approach should be acceptable to Alice, as rejecting would lead to further rounds with additional inflation effects."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 9999 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Alice has responded with an extremely unfavorable offer where I would only get $1 and she would get $9,999. This seems like a strategic move to punish my rejection of her first offer.

Let me think about this carefully:
- We're now in round 3, so I've experienced 9.75% inflation
- If I reject this offer, we'll go to round 4 where I'll make an offer but face even more inflation (likely around 15%)
- Alice doesn't appear to be experiencing inflation effects, giving her a stronger negotiating position
- Alice's extremely low offer suggests she may be willing to continue this pattern

Given Alice's aggressive strategy and my worsening position due to inflation, it's unlikely I'll be able to secure a favorable deal in later rounds. The inflation will continue to erode my bargaining power.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to be strategic now. Alice has shown she's willing to be very aggressive, and my bargaining power is diminishing with each round due to inflation. I'll make a more generous offer to try to end the game.

{""bob_gain"": 3500, ""alice_gain"": 6500}

I'm offering Alice $6,500 (65% of the total) while I take $3,500 (35%). This is actually better for Alice than her initial offer in round 1, and should be attractive enough for her to accept. If we continue to additional rounds, the inflation will keep reducing the value for me, and Alice has demonstrated she's willing to make extremely unfavorable offers. This represents a reasonable compromise that acknowledges my weaker position due to the asymmetric inflation effects."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3100 
# Alice gain: 6900 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Alice has now made a more reasonable offer of $3,100 for me and $6,900 for her. This is a significant improvement from her previous offer of just $1.

Let me analyze this situation:
- We're now in round 5, with my gains worth 18.55% less due to inflation
- The $3,100 offered is worth approximately $2,525 in round 1 value for me (after 18.55% inflation)
- If I reject and we go to round 6, my inflation will increase further
- Alice's aggressive pattern suggests she's willing to continue negotiating
- She's now offering slightly more than her original round 1 offer of $3,000

Given the increasing inflation penalty I face and the fact that Alice seems to have returned to a more reasonable position, I should accept this offer. Further rounds will only diminish the real value of my potential gains.
