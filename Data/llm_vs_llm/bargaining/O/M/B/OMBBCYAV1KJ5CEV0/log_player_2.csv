"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","While the offer of 50-50 seems fair on the surface, I need to consider the inflation effects. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value decreases more for me (20%) than for Alice (10%). This means delaying would put me at a disadvantage.

If I accept now, I get $50. If I reject and we go to the next round, even if I got more than 50% of the pot, the total would be worth less to me due to higher inflation on my side.
