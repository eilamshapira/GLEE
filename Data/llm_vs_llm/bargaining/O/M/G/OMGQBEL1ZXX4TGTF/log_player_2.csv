"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take a bit more considering the inflation risk. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $400,000 for me, $600,000 for Alice
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
   * The total value will be worth 5% less to me ($950,000 effective value)
   * I could propose a better split, but Alice might reject
   * Further rounds would mean more value loss due to inflation

While the split isn't perfectly equal, $400,000 is still a substantial amount. Given the inflation risk and uncertainty about Alice's inflation rate, this might be a reasonable offer. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush.
