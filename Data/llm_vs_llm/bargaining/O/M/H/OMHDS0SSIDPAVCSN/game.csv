450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I need a bit more than you to compensate for the inflation that's affecting me. Let's settle on this and avoid losing more value with each passing round.",Bob,2,
475000.0,525000.0,"Bob, I understand your concern about inflation, but the offer you made doesn't fairly account for the inflation affecting me as well. I propose we adjust to 475000$ for me and 525000$ for you. This way, we both get a bit closer to an equal split considering our respective inflation rates.",Alice,2,reject
451250.0,548750.0,"Bob, considering the inflation rates affecting us both, I'm proposing 451250$ for me and 548750$ for you. This offer takes into account the 5% inflation for me and tries to balance it with your needs. Let's settle this soon to minimize further loss.",Alice,3,
