"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 735091.89 
# Alice gain: 264908.11 
Do you accept this offer?","I should carefully consider this offer. Alice is proposing that I get approximately 73.5% of the money while she gets 26.5%. This is a generous first offer from my perspective.

If I reject and move to the next round, inflation will reduce the value of my share by 5%, meaning the $1,000,000 will effectively be worth $950,000 to me in round 2. Even if I proposed a better split for myself in the next round, I need to account for this depreciation.

Given that:
1. This is a favorable first offer
2. Inflation will reduce the value in future rounds
3. There's risk Alice might propose less favorable terms if we continue
