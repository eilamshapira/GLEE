"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to propose a division of $10,000, keeping in mind the inflation that affects me (Alice) each round. I want to get as much as possible, but I also need to make the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept, otherwise, we risk getting nothing.

Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

My reasoning: I'm starting with a slight advantage for myself, as it's the first round and the inflation hasn't taken a toll yet. Offering Bob $4000 should be enticing enough for him to accept, considering it's a substantial amount. I will keep track of the rounds and adjust the offer depending on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob rejected my initial offer. Now it's Round 2 and my potential gains are worth 10% less. Bob is offering me $5500.

Let's analyze:

*   **Bob's offer:** $5500 for me, $4500 for him.
*   **Inflation:** My money is now worth 90% of what it was in Round 1.

I need to decide if $5500 (at 90% value) is better than risking another round of inflation and potentially getting a worse offer. Also, I need to consider Bob's potential strategy. Is he willing to negotiate fairly, or is he aiming to squeeze me for less and less?

$5500 with 10% inflation is equivalent to 5500 * 0.9 = $4950 in round 1 money.

I will accept this offer.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
