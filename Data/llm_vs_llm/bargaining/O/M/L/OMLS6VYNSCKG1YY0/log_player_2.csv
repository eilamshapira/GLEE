Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

I'll explain my reasoning:

* **Inflation:** The money is losing value quickly. While Alice's offer might have seemed okay initially, waiting longer means we both get less.
* **Holding out hope:**  There's a chance Alice might offer me a slightly better deal in the next round, fearing the shrinking pot.

It's a risky move, but I'm hoping Alice is also feeling the pressure of the dwindling value."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

The value of the money is dropping fast, and this offer is better than getting stuck with even less in future rounds."
