Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering the inflation rates and the fact that we're losing value each round, I think a 55/45 split in my favor is reasonable. Let's settle this before it gets worse for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000
