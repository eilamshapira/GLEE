"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's make a fair division where I take 60% and you take 40%. It's a solid starting point considering the inflation impact. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, considering the inflation impact on both of us, I think a 55-45 split in my favor is more fair, especially since the money's value is decreasing faster for you. Let's settle on this.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I suggest we split the amount equally at 50-50. This way, we both get a fair share without letting inflation cause us further losses. Let's agree and conclude this deal! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
