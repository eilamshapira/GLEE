"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance. However, I need to account for the inflation factor.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value will be worth 20% less to me (meaning the $100 would be worth only $80 from my perspective). Even if I were to get a larger share in the next round, I need to weigh that against this depreciation.

A 50-50 split gives me $50 right now. If I wait, I'd need to secure more than $62.50 of the original $100 in the next round to make rejecting worthwhile (since $62.50 Ã— 0.8 = $50).

Given the uncertainty of whether Alice would accept a more favorable proposal from me, and the guaranteed loss of value due to inflation, I'll accept this fair offer.
