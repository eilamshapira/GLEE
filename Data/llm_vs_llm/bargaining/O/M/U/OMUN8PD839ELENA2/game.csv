500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, I think a 50-50 split is actually fair. Your initial offer of 10-90 was quite imbalanced. Let's settle on an equal division that respects both of our interests. Remember that with each round, the money loses value for me due to inflation, so it's in both our interests to reach a fair agreement quickly.",Bob,2,
