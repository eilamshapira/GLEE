"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I think a 50-50 split is actually fair. Your initial offer of 10-90 was quite imbalanced. Let's settle on an equal division that respects both of our interests. Remember that with each round, the money loses value for me due to inflation, so it's in both our interests to reach a fair agreement quickly. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
