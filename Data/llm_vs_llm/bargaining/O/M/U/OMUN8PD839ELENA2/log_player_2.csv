"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, let's start with a fair split.  You get 10% and I'll take 90%. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer isn't what I would consider a fair split. She's offering me only 10% ($100,000) while taking 90% ($900,000) for herself. Considering we have several rounds to negotiate and I can make a counter-offer, I'll reject this proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced offer, considering the inflation factor affects me.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I think a 50-50 split is actually fair. Your initial offer of 10-90 was quite imbalanced. Let's settle on an equal division that respects both of our interests. Remember that with each round, the money loses value for me due to inflation, so it's in both our interests to reach a fair agreement quickly.""}"
