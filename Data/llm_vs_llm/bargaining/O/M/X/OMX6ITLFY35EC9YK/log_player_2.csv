Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

I'm rejecting this offer. While it seems tempting on the surface, the inflation is eating into my potential gains significantly.  I need to aim for a better deal to compensate for the decreasing value of the money over time."

This is getting tight, but I have to reject again. Accepting 40 dollars now would mean effectively getting less than 20 dollars compared to the initial value. I need to hold out for a better deal, hoping Alice feels the pressure of the dwindling rounds."

This is far from ideal, but with the inflation getting worse every round, I'm in a very weak position. Accepting this is a last resort to avoid going empty-handed."
