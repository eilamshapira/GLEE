"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer to Bob that takes into account the inflation factor. Since the money loses 10% of its value for Bob each round but not for me, there's an incentive for him to accept a reasonable offer now rather than waiting.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose a 50-50 split of the $10,000, where we each receive $5,000. This is a fair division that gives us equal shares, and Bob should consider that if he rejects this offer, the next round will be worth less to him due to the 10% inflation on his side."
