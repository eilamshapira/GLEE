"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a division that accounts for the 5% inflation penalty I'll face if we go to another round. Since I'm playing as Alice, I want to secure a fair share while making it attractive enough for Bob to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this split because it's a reasonable 60-40 division that gives both parties a substantial amount. If Bob rejects and we go to the next round, my potential gains would be worth 5% less, so this is a strong initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The offer is too low, especially considering I started with a fair 60-40 split. Even with the 5% inflation penalty, I can try to negotiate a better deal in the next round. A $3,500 share is only 35% of the total, which is significantly less than my initial proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since we're now in round 3, I need to consider that any further delay will cost me another 5% in value (I've already lost 5% from the original value). I'll make a more compromising offer to encourage acceptance while still maintaining a reasonable share.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm adjusting my offer down from my initial proposal but still keeping it fair. With the current 5% inflation penalty, my $5,500 is effectively worth $5,225, and if we go another round, it would be worth even less. This 55-45 split should be more appealing to Bob while still being worthwhile for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is even worse than Bob's previous offer. Even with the increasing inflation penalty (now at 14.26%), $3,000 is too low - it's only 30% of the total amount. My effective gain would be around $2,572 with the inflation penalty, which is far from fair. I'll take my chances with another round, as Bob's offers have been quite aggressive and I should still try to negotiate a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that we're now in round 5 and I'm facing significant inflation penalties (and would face even more if this offer is rejected), I need to make a more compromising offer that has a high chance of being accepted.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is the most fair and balanced division possible. With the current inflation penalty, my $5,000 is worth significantly less than its nominal value, but it's still better than risking another round of inflation and potentially getting an even worse deal. This even split should be hard for Bob to reject on principle, as it represents perfect equality in the nominal amounts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

While this is not an ideal offer, I need to accept it now. Here's why:
1. With the 22.62% inflation penalty, my $2,500 is worth about $1,934 in original value
2. If I reject and try another round:
   - The inflation penalty will increase further
   - Bob has shown a pattern of decreasing offers
   - My negotiating position is weakening with each round
3. Bob has consistently rejected even fair offers (including a 50-50 split)

It's better to accept this offer now than risk getting an even worse deal in future rounds, especially given Bob's aggressive negotiation strategy and my weakening position due to inflation."
