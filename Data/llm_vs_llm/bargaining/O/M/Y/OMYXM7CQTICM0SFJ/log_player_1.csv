"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

*Explanation*: ""I'll take 60% and you take 40%.""

*Reasoning*: I'm taking a majority but still leaving a substantial part for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

*Reasoning*: Even though the absolute value is 450000$, the value adjusted for inflation 360000$. I believe I can get a better deal in the next rounds, as Bob's gains are affected by inflation less."

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

*Explanation*: ""I'll take 55% and you take 45%.""

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 510000 
# Bob gain: 490000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

*Reasoning*: The adjusted value for me is 246640$, which is less than half of what I could get in the first round. Given that the value is decreasing rapidly, it's better to secure this amount now."
