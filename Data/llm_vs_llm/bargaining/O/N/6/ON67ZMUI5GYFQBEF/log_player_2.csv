""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's aim for a more balanced agreement. I'm offering 47% to me and 53% to you, considering the inflation impacting my value more with each round. 
# Bob gain: 530000 
# Alice gain: 470000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Alice is acknowledging the impact of inflation on her returns, her offer still doesn't reflect the urgency of the situation. I'm willing to be a little more flexible, but I need to see a greater shift in my favor."

# Alice's message: I recognize the impact of inflation, so here's a slight improvement to your advantage: 46% to me and 54% to you. This offer considers your stronger position while still being fair to both. 
# Bob gain: 540000 
# Alice gain: 460000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Alice's offer is slowly moving in the right direction, the increments are too small given the rate of inflation and the dwindling number of rounds. I need to see a more significant shift to accept."

# Alice gain: 440000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This offer is finally acceptable.  While I could push for more, the shrinking pot and limited time make this a reasonable compromise."
