"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we divide the money 80% to me and 20% to you. Let's secure some gain now! 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The offer from Alice is very uneven, heavily favoring her with 80% of the total. I should consider that if I reject, the money will be worth 20% less in the next round, but I'll have the chance to make a more balanced proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split that accounts for the 20% inflation while still being fair to both of us.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. This gives us both $5,000, which is much better than the 80-20 split you proposed. If we delay further, we'll both lose money to inflation.""}"
