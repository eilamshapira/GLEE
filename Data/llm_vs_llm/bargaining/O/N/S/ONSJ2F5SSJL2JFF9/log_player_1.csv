"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first move and taking initiative. This is still a very fair offer for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your initial offer. I propose an even 50-50 split which is completely fair to both of us. We both walk away with $5000, and we can settle this amicably without dragging out negotiations. This equal division respects both our positions in the game. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer of an equal 50-50 split. This is a fair and reasonable solution that benefits both of us equally, and it's better to secure a good outcome now rather than risk worse outcomes through extended negotiation."
