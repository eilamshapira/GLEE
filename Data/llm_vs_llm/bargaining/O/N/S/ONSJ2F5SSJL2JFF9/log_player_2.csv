"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first move and taking initiative. This is still a very fair offer for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll carefully consider Alice's first offer of a 60-40 split in her favor.

While Alice makes a point about taking initiative with the first move, this isn't inherently worth a premium in this negotiation game. There are still many rounds remaining, and I could make a counter-offer in the next round that might be more favorable to me.

A 60-40 split would give me $4,000, which is substantial, but I believe there's room for a more equitable division.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a fair counter-offer to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your initial offer. I propose an even 50-50 split which is completely fair to both of us. We both walk away with $5,000, and we can settle this amicably without dragging out negotiations. This equal division respects both our positions in the game.""}"
