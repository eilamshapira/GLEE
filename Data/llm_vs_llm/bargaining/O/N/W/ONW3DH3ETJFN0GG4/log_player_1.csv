"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to agree quickly due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's split it 50-50. This way, we both benefit equally and avoid losing value as the rounds progress. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. With 5% inflation, $50 is now worth $47.50 to me
2. This is less than I could get from my initial offer
3. However, if I reject, the next round will have even more inflation
4. Bob seems reasonable with a fair 50-50 split
5. Getting $47.50 in real value now is better than risking further inflation
