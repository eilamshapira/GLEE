"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a balanced first offer, considering that Bob's money loses value faster than mine (10% vs 5% per round), so there's an incentive for him to accept sooner rather than later.

{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I propose a fair split considering future value loss. If we continue to next round, your share will be worth less due to 10% inflation on your side.""
