"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this... Alice offered an equal split of $50 each, which is completely fair. While I could reject and try to get more in the next round, I need to consider that:

1. The money will be worth 20% less next round
2. Alice might respond with a less favorable offer if I appear greedy
3. A 50-50 split is the most equitable outcome

Given these factors, I'll accept this fair offer.
