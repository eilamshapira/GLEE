"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}
# Explanation: This is a very unfair offer where Alice takes 90% of the money. Since it's early in the game and the inflation penalty isn't severe yet, I'll reject and make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}
# Explanation: I propose a more balanced split, slightly in my favor. This offer gives Alice a substantial amount while being fair to both parties. Given that Alice faces a lower inflation penalty (5% vs my 10%), she should seriously consider accepting this offer rather than prolonging the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
# Explanation: This is a reasonable offer given the circumstances. While not ideal, I need to consider that:
# 1. The inflation is hurting me more than Alice (19% vs 9.75%)
# 2. If I reject, my next offer would be worth even less due to inflation
# 3. The 400k/600k split is much more reasonable than the initial 100k/900k offer
# 4. With 19% inflation, $400,000 now is worth $324,000 of round 1 value
# 5. Further negotiation could lead to worse outcomes due to the asymmetric inflation rates
# Therefore, it's best to accept this offer now."
