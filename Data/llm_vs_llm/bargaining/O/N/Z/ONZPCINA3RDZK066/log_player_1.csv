Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I need to consider the actual value of the offer. 
The offer of 4500 is equivalent to 4500 * 0.8 = 3600 in the first round's value.
Considering this, I think I can get a better deal.
{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 20% * 2 = 40% less for me compared to the initial round (0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64).
I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself.
