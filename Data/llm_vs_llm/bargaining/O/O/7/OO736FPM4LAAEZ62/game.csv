400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, I understand your desire for an even split, but we need to consider the inflation factor. You face 10% inflation per round while I face none. This means waiting is costlier for you. My offer of 600k/400k is fair considering this asymmetry, and you'll get more value by accepting now rather than waiting for future rounds when your share will be worth less to you.",Bob,2,
