"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split the money equally and both walk away happy. Fair and simple!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire for an even split, but we need to consider the inflation factor. You face 10% inflation per round while I face none. This means waiting is costlier for you. My offer of 600k/400k is fair considering this asymmetry, and you'll get more value by accepting now rather than waiting for future rounds when your share will be worth less to you. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
