"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money equally and both walk away happy. Fair and simple! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. While a 50-50 split seems fair on the surface, the game has a key asymmetry: inflation affects Alice more than me. With each passing round, Alice's share loses 10% of its value, while mine maintains full value.

Given that I don't face inflation penalties and Alice does, I have a strategic advantage if we continue to later rounds. Since this is just round 1 of a possible 12 rounds, rejecting this initial offer makes sense.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make an offer that accounts for the inflation asymmetry while still being reasonably attractive to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your desire for an even split, but we need to consider the inflation factor. You face 10% inflation per round while I face none. This means waiting is costlier for you. My offer of 600k/400k is fair considering this asymmetry, and you'll get more value by accepting now rather than waiting for future rounds when your share will be worth less to you.""}"
