35.0,65.0,"Alice, every delay hurts us – my funds lose only 5% per round while yours drop 20%. Accepting now guarantees you a $35 share before further depreciation. Let’s settle immediately rather than lose more value.",Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"Bob, I've reduced my share to show good faith. Due to inflation, my $55 is already worth less than $44 to me, while your $45 is still worth about $43. This is a fair deal that benefits us both - let's not let inflation eat away more value.",Alice,3,

40.0,60.0,"Alice, every round further devalues our money, and you’re hit much harder by inflation. Accept this offer: you get $40 (worth about $20.48 now) and I get $60 (worth roughly $51.44 now). It’s our best chance to secure as much real value as possible.",Bob,4,
