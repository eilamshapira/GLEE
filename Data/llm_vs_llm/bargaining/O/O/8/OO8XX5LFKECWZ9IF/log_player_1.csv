"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every delay hurts us – my funds lose only 5% per round while yours drop 20%. Accepting now guarantees you a $35 share before further depreciation. Let’s settle immediately rather than lose more value. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer as it's too low. While Bob correctly points out the inflation difference, starting with such an uneven split is not acceptable. I'll make a more balanced counter-offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Bob, I've reduced my share to show good faith. Due to inflation, my $55 is already worth less than $44 to me, while your $45 is still worth about $43. This is a fair deal that benefits us both - let's not let inflation eat away more value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every round further devalues our money, and you’re hit much harder by inflation. Accept this offer: you get $40 (worth about $20.48 now) and I get $60 (worth roughly $51.44 now). It’s our best chance to secure as much real value as possible. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept this offer. With the severe inflation penalty I face (48.8%), delaying further would significantly reduce the real value of any future share I might receive. While not ideal, $40 now is better than risking further devaluation in future rounds."
