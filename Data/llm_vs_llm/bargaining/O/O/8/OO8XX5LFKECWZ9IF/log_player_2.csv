"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair - I'm offering you a generous 40% split, considering the higher inflation penalty I face. This way we both walk away with a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Alice, every delay hurts us – my funds lose only 5% per round while yours drop 20%. Accepting now guarantees you a $35 share before further depreciation. Let’s settle immediately rather than lose more value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I've reduced my share to show good faith. Due to inflation, my $55 is already worth less than $44 to me, while your $45 is still worth about $43. This is a fair deal that benefits us both - let's not let inflation eat away more value. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, every round further devalues our money, and you’re hit much harder by inflation. Accept this offer: you get $40 (worth about $20.48 now) and I get $60 (worth roughly $51.44 now). It’s our best chance to secure as much real value as possible.""}"
