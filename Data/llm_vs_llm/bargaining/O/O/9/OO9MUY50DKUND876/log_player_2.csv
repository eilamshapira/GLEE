"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With a 50-50 split, I would get $500,000. However, if I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the money will be worth 10% less to me, meaning my $500,000 would effectively become worth $450,000.

If I try to negotiate for more, I risk Alice rejecting my offer, leading to further rounds where inflation will hurt my position even more. While I could try to get more than 50%, the risk of losing value through inflation makes this initial fair split quite reasonable.
