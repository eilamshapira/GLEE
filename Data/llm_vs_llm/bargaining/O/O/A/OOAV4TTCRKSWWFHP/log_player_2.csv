"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
- Alice is offering me $40 out of $100
- If I reject, we move to next round where I can make a counter-offer
- But inflation will reduce my money's value by 5%
- $40 now is better than $42.10 in the next round (which would be worth $40 after 5% inflation)
- There's also risk of further negotiation rounds reducing value more
