"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I will try to maximize my gains while considering the declining value of the money and the need to reach an agreement.

Here's my offer for Round 1, in JSON format:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   **Initial Offer:** I'm starting with a slightly advantageous offer for myself, but not excessively so. I hope this encourages Bob to accept in the early rounds, before inflation significantly impacts the value of the money.
*   **Reasoning:** I am taking into account that this is the first round, so I will take the advantage.

Now, relay this offer to Bob. I await his response."
