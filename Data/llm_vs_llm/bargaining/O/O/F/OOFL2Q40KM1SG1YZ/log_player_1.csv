Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was tempting, but inflation makes it risky for me to accept. How about a slightly better split? 55 for me and 45 for you. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
