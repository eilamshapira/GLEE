"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me think strategically about this. Given that:
1. Bob's money loses 5% value each round
2. My money keeps its value
3. We have 12 rounds maximum
4. Bob is rational and understands the inflation impact

I'll make a reasonable first offer that accounts for these factors but isn't too aggressive.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This is a fair 60-40 split in my favor, acknowledging that:
1. I have the first-mover advantage
2. Bob faces inflation pressure to accept sooner rather than later
3. It still gives Bob a substantial portion that's worth accepting"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Bob is offering me $4500, which is worth full value to me
2. Bob wants $5500, which is actually worth $5225 to him due to 5% inflation
3. If I reject, I can make a new offer next round
4. But Bob's portion will be worth another 5% less to him in the next round
5. There's still plenty of rounds left (10 more)
6. I believe I can get a better deal by rejecting this

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll be able to make a new offer next round, and Bob's increasing inflation pressure should make him more amenable to a better split in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that Bob has now experienced two rounds of inflation (reducing his money's value by about 10% total), and he rejected my initial 60-40 split, I'll adjust my strategy slightly:

{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500}

This 65-35 split is justified because:
1. Bob's portion is now worth about 10% less to him due to inflation
2. He's shown he's willing to negotiate but also wants a significant portion
3. The pressure of inflation is mounting on his side
4. There's still 9 rounds left, but each round makes Bob's position weaker
5. This offer still gives Bob a meaningful amount ($3500), which is better than risking further rounds of inflation"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Bob is offering me $4200 (full value)
2. Bob wants $5800, which is actually worth only about $4973 to him due to 14.26% inflation
3. We're in round 4 of 12, so there are still 8 rounds left
4. Bob's portion will continue to lose value each round (another 5% next round)
5. My first offer of $6000 and second offer of $6500 were both rejected
6. $4200 is less than both Bob's previous offer ($4500) and my minimum expectations

Given these factors, especially that Bob is offering me less than his previous offer while his own portion is worth less to him:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I believe I can get a better deal by rejecting this offer and making a new proposal next round, as Bob's inflation pressure continues to mount."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that:
1. Bob has now experienced 4 rounds of inflation (his money is worth about 19% less)
2. He's shown he's still trying to get a larger portion despite the inflation
3. My previous offers of 60-40 and 65-35 were rejected
4. We still have 7 rounds left, but the inflation pressure on Bob is significant
5. Bob's last offer was more aggressive, suggesting I need to be somewhat more accommodating

I'll adjust my offer to be more appealing while still maintaining my advantage:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm returning to my original 60-40 split because:
1. $4000 for Bob (worth about $3240 to him now) is still better than risking more rounds of inflation
2. It's a more conciliatory offer than my last one, showing willingness to negotiate
3. The mounting inflation pressure should make this more attractive now than in round 1"
