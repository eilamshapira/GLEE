600000.0,400000.0,Let's split this fairly! I propose 60/40. We both get a good chunk of the money.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I appreciate your spirit for fairness. To avoid any further delays (and potential inflation surprises), I propose that I receive 550000$ and you receive 450000$. Let's settle now and ensure we both walk away with a considerable sum!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Alright Bob, let's go 50/50 this round. A perfectly fair split, ensuring we both benefit significantly. Let's end this now!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
520000.0,480000.0,"Alice, I know we both want to avoid further losses due to inflation. With each round, your share loses value, and I want to ensure you get a better deal by closing this now. I'm offering you 520000 nominal dollars (which is worth about 332800 considering the 36% discount) while I take 480000. This slight edge for you should be more attractive than risking further depreciation. Let's agree and settle this today!",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, let's try to make this the final round. I propose 55/45. I think this is a fair split considering the situation, and ensures we both get a good amount of money. What do you say? Let's end it here!",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
490000.0,510000.0,"Alice, the inflation is taking a significant toll on the value of your share. At this stage, if we delay even further, your nominal dollars will lose even more of their real value—a risk you surely want to avoid. I'm offering you 490000 nominal dollars, which at the current inflation rate works out to roughly 200704 in real terms, while I take 510000 that retain full value. This deal gives you more than what you'd likely secure if you opted to wait. Let's put an end to the process now before further losses occur for you.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Bob, it's time to stop this. I'm offering a 50/50 split again. Let's end this and get this deal done. This offer is final.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Alice, as we move forward the inflation is eroding the real value of your share even faster. Accepting my offer now means you secure 600000 nominal dollars, which—given the current discount of roughly 73.79%—yields an effective value of about 157300. If we delay further, the outlook in your favor only deteriorates (with the next round your effective payout dropping considerably even if you control the proposal). I believe it’s in both our interests to end this now. Let’s settle and avoid further losses.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, let's make this count as a final offer. 60/40 split. Take it or leave it. We're running out of time.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
5000.0,995000.0,"Alice, the numbers now are stark. At this round, your dollars are worth only about 10.74% of their face value due to inflation, meaning 5000 nominal dollars come down to roughly 537 in real terms. If we proceed to round 11, you'll be forced into a corner where, to get Bob's agreement, you'd have to offer him nearly all of the money—leaving you with nothing. In this final attempt to salvage any value for you, I'm offering 5000 nominal dollars, which beats the alternative of ending with zero. I urge you to accept this offer before we both risk walking away empty-handed.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
100000.0,900000.0,"Bob, last chance. 10/90 split. Take it or neither of us gets anything. This is the last round.",Alice,11,
,,"Alice, I see your offer, but it’s simply not in my best interest. Rejecting now leads us to the final round where I’ll have full control over the proposal. In the last round, I can offer you the tiniest fraction—just enough to be better than nothing—and secure almost the entire million for myself. I know it sounds harsh, but the numbers don't lie. Let's take it to round 12.",Bob,11,reject
1000.0,999000.0,"Alice, this is the final round and our last chance to both get something rather than nothing. With the current inflation, the real value of your share has eroded drastically, and any further delay will leave you with zero. I'm offering you 1000 nominal dollars—which, although it may seem small, is infinitely better than walking away empty-handed. Accept this deal, and we both secure a payout before the process ends.",Bob,12,
