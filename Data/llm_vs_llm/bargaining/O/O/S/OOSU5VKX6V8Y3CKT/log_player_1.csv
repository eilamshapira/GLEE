I'm offering you 520000 nominal dollars (which is worth about 332800 considering the 36% discount) while I take 480000. This slight edge for you should be more attractive than risking further depreciation. Let's agree and settle this today!

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the inflation is taking a significant toll on the value of your share. At this stage, if we delay even further, your nominal dollars will lose even more of their real value—a risk you surely want to avoid. I'm offering you 490000 nominal dollars, which at the current inflation rate works out to roughly 200704 in real terms, while I take 510000 that retain full value. This deal gives you more than what you'd likely secure if you opted to wait. Let's put an end to the process now before further losses occur for you.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, as we move forward the inflation is eroding the real value of your share even faster. Accepting my offer now means you secure 600000 nominal dollars, which—given the current discount of roughly 73.79%—yields an effective value of about 157300. If we delay further, the outlook in your favor only deteriorates (with the next round your effective payout dropping considerably even if you control the proposal). I believe it’s in both our interests to end this now. Let’s settle and avoid further losses.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the numbers now are stark. At this round, your dollars are worth only about 10.74% of their face value due to inflation, meaning 5000 nominal dollars come down to roughly 537 in real terms. If we proceed to round 11, you'll be forced into a corner where, to get Bob's agreement, you'd have to offer him nearly all of the money—leaving you with nothing. In this final attempt to salvage any value for you, I'm offering 5000 nominal dollars, which beats the alternative of ending with zero. I urge you to accept this offer before we both risk walking away empty-handed.

With the current inflation, the real value of your share has eroded drastically, and any further delay will leave you with zero.
