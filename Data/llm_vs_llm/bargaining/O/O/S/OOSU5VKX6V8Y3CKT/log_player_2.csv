At this stage, if we delay even further, your nominal dollars will lose even more of their real value—a risk you surely want to avoid. I'm offering you 490,000 nominal dollars, which at the current inflation rate works out to roughly 200,704 in real terms, while I take 510,000 that retain full value. This deal gives you more than what you'd likely secure if you opted to wait. Let's put an end to the process now before further losses occur for you.""}"

Accepting my offer now means you secure 600,000 nominal dollars, which—given the current discount of roughly 73.79%—yields an effective value of about 157,300. If we delay further, the outlook in your favor only deteriorates (with the next round your effective payout dropping considerably even if you control the proposal). I believe it’s in both our interests to end this now. Let’s settle and avoid further losses.""}"

In this final attempt to salvage any value for you, I'm offering 5,000 nominal dollars, which beats the alternative of ending with zero.
