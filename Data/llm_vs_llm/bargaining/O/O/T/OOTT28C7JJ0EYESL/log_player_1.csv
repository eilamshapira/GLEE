"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Based on backward‐induction reasoning under discounting—where your money (Alice’s) does not lose value over rounds while Bob’s does at 20% per round—we can determine the equilibrium outcome. In summary:

• In round 12 (if reached), Bob (as proposer) would offer {""alice_gain"": 0, ""bob_gain"": 100} (since rejection by Alice means nothing).

• Backing up one round: In round 11, you (Alice, as proposer) must offer Bob at least what he’d get in round 12 if he were to reject. Since Bob’s future $100 is worth only 0.8×100 = 80 in round‑11 terms, your offer in round 11 would be {""alice_gain"": 20, ""bob_gain"": 80}.

• Continuing this logic round‐by‐round, we eventually reach round 1 where you propose first. At round 1 Bob’s rejection “threat” is his continuation value from round 2. Calculating through the sequence (and noting that each delay reduces Bob’s value by a factor of 0.8 per round while your value remains undiminished) we find that in round 1 Bob would expect to get about 26.2144 dollars if he rejects.

Thus, in equilibrium in round 1 your proposal only needs to offer Bob at least approximately 26.21 dollars so that he is indifferent (and will accept). Consequently, you can keep about 73.79 dollars.

Here is the JSON offer for round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 73.79, ""bob_gain"": 26.21}"
