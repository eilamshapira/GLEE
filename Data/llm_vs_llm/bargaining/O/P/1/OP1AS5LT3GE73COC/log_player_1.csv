"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a reasonable offer, considering I want to secure a good amount but also need Bob to accept to avoid inflation eating into the value.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this split because while it gives me a favorable portion, it still offers Bob a substantial amount. If he rejects, inflation will reduce the value of any future deal for me, and we risk getting nothing if we can't agree within 12 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this... 

If I accept now, I'll get $4000 with 10% inflation, so effectively $3600.
If I reject and make a counter-offer, any future gains will be worth even less due to continuing inflation.
While I could try to negotiate for more, the risk of further inflation and potential deadlock makes this offer reasonable enough.
