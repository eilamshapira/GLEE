6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering you lose 5% value each round, so accepting now is in your best interest.",Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"Hi Alice, considering I'm losing 5% value each round, I think a 55-45 split in my favor is reasonable. It's better for both of us to settle now rather than risking further loss.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, let's be reasonable. You've already lost 10% value due to inflation. I'm offering you $4500 which is worth about $4050 to you now. If we keep going, you'll lose even more value. This is a fair split considering the circumstances.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4750.0,5250.0,"Alice, I understand your point, but I still think we can find a better compromise. Considering the current value loss, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. A 52.5-47.5 split seems fair, given the circumstances.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, you've now lost about 19% value due to inflation. Your $4800 is actually worth around $3888 to you now. If we continue this back and forth, you'll keep losing value. This is a very reasonable offer considering the circumstances - let's end this now.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, despite the value loss, I'm willing to propose a 50-50 split. This way, we both get an equal share, and I'm willing to accept the reduced value. Let's end this and walk away with a fair split.",Bob,6,
