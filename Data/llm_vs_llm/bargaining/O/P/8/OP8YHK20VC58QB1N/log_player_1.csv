"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I understand that I need to make an offer to split $1,000,000 with Bob. Given that:
1. I'm facing higher inflation (20% per round) compared to Bob's 5%
2. We have a maximum of 12 rounds
3. I need to make an attractive offer to avoid delays that would hurt me more than Bob

I'll propose a split that favors me but is still reasonable enough for Bob to consider accepting:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

This way I get 60% of the money, which compensates for my higher inflation risk, while Bob still gets a substantial amount. If Bob refuses, the next round will already cost me 20% of the value, while only costing him 5%."
