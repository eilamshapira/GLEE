"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is suggesting that she gets $60 and I get $40 of the $100. While this isn't an even split, I need to consider that if I reject and we go to another round, the total value will decrease by 20% to $80 total. 

Let me think about this: If I reject, we'll have $80 to split in the next round where I'll make the offer. Even if I proposed a very favorable split for myself in the next round, the total amount is already reduced.
