"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a reasonable offer that recognizes the inflation pressure on my side and provides a fair division.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering a 55/45 split in my favor. This slightly higher portion for myself accounts for the 20% inflation penalty I face if we go to the next round. I believe this is fair and allows us both to walk away with a substantial amount."
