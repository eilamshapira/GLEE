"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's get this done quickly! I think this is a fair split to start. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. This is the first round, so there's no inflation yet
2. Alice is offering me 40$ and keeping 60$
3. If I reject:
   - Next round I can make an offer
   - But the money will be worth 20% less to me (and 5% less to her)
   - My $40 would become worth $32, and her $60 would become worth $57

While the split isn't perfectly equal, accepting now gives me a solid $40. If I reject, I'd need to secure significantly more than $50 in the next round just to make up for my higher inflation rate. Given the asymmetric inflation rates, it's better to accept a slightly lower amount now than risk further rounds.
