"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it evenly, no need to gamble 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With a 50-50 split, I would get $500,000. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the money will be worth 10% less to me, meaning I'd need to get at least $555,556 in the next round just to break even with what I can get now.

While I could try to negotiate for more, there's a risk that Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to further rounds and more value loss due to inflation. Also, a 50-50 split is generally considered fair.
