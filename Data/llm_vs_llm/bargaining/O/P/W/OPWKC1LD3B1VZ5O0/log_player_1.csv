"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me make a strategic first offer. Since Bob faces a 5% depreciation per round while I don't, I can use this to my advantage.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This is a reasonable first offer that gives me 60% and Bob 40% of the total amount. I'm proposing that I receive $6,000 and Bob receives $4,000. This is fair because:
1. It's a substantial amount for both parties
2. If Bob rejects, their next potential gains will be worth 5% less to them
3. It leaves room for negotiation if needed"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Bob offers a 50-50 split ($5000 each)
2. For Bob, their $5000 is actually worth only $4750 due to the 5% inflation
3. For me, the $5000 maintains its full value
4. If I reject, we go to round 3, where:
   - I can make a new offer
   - Bob's money will depreciate another 5%
   - I might be able to get a better deal

However, $5000 is still a reasonable amount, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the next round. If negotiations drag on, Bob might become more resistant due to their losses from inflation.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept the 50-50 split as it's a fair offer and guarantees me a good outcome without further risk."
