600000.0,400000.0,"I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This ensures we both get a substantial amount, and it's a fair start given the inflation affecting me.",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. Since you face 5% inflation per round, this offer actually gives you $450000 now, which is worth more than potentially getting a larger number in a future round after inflation. This is fair considering the inflation dynamics, and we both walk away with a substantial amount.",Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. Given the inflation, this ensures we both get a fair share, and it's a reasonable compromise considering the previous rounds.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
425000.0,575000.0,"I'm proposing a 57.5-42.5 split. With your inflation now approaching 10% and increasing each round, this $425000 now is worth significantly more to you than a larger amount in future rounds. If we go to round 5, your inflation will be even higher. This offer is fair considering the game's dynamics and gives us both substantial amounts. Let's conclude the negotiation and both walk away with significant value.",Bob,4,
