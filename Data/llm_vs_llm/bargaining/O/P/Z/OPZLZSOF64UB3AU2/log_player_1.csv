Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. Since you face 5% inflation per round, this offer actually gives you $450000 now, which is worth more than potentially getting a larger number in a future round after inflation. This is fair considering the inflation dynamics, and we both walk away with a substantial amount. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a 57.5-42.5 split. With your inflation now approaching 10% and increasing each round, this $425000 now is worth significantly more to you than a larger amount in future rounds. If we go to round 5, your inflation will be even higher. This offer is fair considering the game's dynamics and gives us both substantial amounts. Let's conclude the negotiation and both walk away with significant value. 
# Alice gain: 425000 
# Bob gain: 575000
