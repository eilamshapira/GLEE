"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This ensures we both get a substantial amount, and it's a fair start given the inflation affecting me. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer from Alice.

Alice is proposing a 60-40 split in her favor, which would give me $400,000 and her $600,000.

Let me consider the inflation dynamics:
- For me (Bob), there's 0% inflation between rounds, so my money retains full value
- For Alice, there's 5% inflation between rounds, so her money loses value over time

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, Alice would value whatever amount I offer her at 5% less. This gives me some negotiating leverage.

Given that I don't face any inflation penalty, I can reject this offer and propose a more favorable split in the next round.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that accounts for the inflation dynamics while still being reasonable enough for Alice to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. Since you face 5% inflation per round, this offer actually gives you $450,000 now, which is worth more than potentially getting a larger number in a future round after inflation. This is fair considering the inflation dynamics, and we both walk away with a substantial amount.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. Given the inflation, this ensures we both get a fair share, and it's a reasonable compromise considering the previous rounds. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze Alice's new offer.

Alice is now proposing a 55-45 split in her favor, which would give me $450,000 and her $550,000.

Key considerations:
- Alice is facing 9.75% inflation compared to round 1 (5% compounded)
- I face no inflation penalty, so my money retains full value
- If we continue to another round, Alice's inflation disadvantage increases further
- I offered 55-45 in my favor last round, and she's now offering 55-45 in her favor

Since I don't face any inflation, I can afford to continue negotiating. The inflation pressure on Alice will become stronger with each round, potentially allowing me to secure a better deal. Alice's rejection of my previous offer suggests she's willing to continue negotiating despite her inflation disadvantage.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 575000, 
""alice_gain"": 425000, 
""message"": ""I'm proposing a 57.5-42.5 split. With your inflation now approaching 10% and increasing each round, this $425,000 now is worth significantly more to you than a larger amount in future rounds. If we go to round 5, your inflation will be even higher. This offer is fair considering the game's dynamics and gives us both substantial amounts. Let's conclude the negotiation and both walk away with significant value.""}"
