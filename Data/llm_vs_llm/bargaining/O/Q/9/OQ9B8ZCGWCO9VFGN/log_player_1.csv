"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this fairly 50-50. This is much better than your previous offer, and even with the 20% depreciation you face, you'll get more value accepting this than making another round of extreme offers. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
