"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take the majority, but you get something too. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","I should reject this offer. Even though Alice's money will be worth 20% less next round, she's currently trying to take 90% of the total amount which is clearly unfair. By rejecting, I can make a more reasonable counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split, considering that Alice faces 20% depreciation per round. Even with this depreciation, a fair split would be more beneficial for both of us than extreme proposals.

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's split this fairly 50-50. This is much better than your previous offer, and even with the 20% depreciation you face, you'll get more value accepting this than making another round of extreme offers.""}"
