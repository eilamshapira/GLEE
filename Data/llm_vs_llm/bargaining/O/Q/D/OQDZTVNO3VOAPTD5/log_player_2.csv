"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

This is a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance. However, if I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me. So if I reject now, I'd need to secure significantly more than $5000 in the next round just to break even with the current offer.

For example, if I reject and go to the next round, $5000 would only be worth $4000 to me due to the 20% inflation penalty. It would be risky to reject this offer hoping for a better deal, as Alice knows I'm under time pressure.

Given these circumstances, a 50-50 split in the first round is actually quite reasonable.
