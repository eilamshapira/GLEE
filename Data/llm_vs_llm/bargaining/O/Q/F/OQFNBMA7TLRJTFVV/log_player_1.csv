"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with an offer that takes into account our different inflation rates.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, 
""bob_gain"": 4800}

Since Bob faces a higher inflation rate (10% vs my 5%), he should have a stronger incentive to accept an early offer rather than continuing to the next round. My offer gives him a substantial portion while leaving me with a slight advantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to be strategic since we're now in Round 3 and the inflation effects are compounding. For me, the value is down 10% (5% per round), and for Bob, it's down 20% (10% per round).

{""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm offering an even 50-50 split now. This is fair and reasonable considering:
1. Bob rejected my first offer
2. I rejected his counter that favored him
3. The money is worth less to both of us now, but especially to Bob
4. An even split represents a compromise that avoids further devaluation"
