"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me in each round, I'll try to make a fair offer. Considering the initial amount is $10,000, after one round, it's worth $9,500 for me (5% less).

My offer:
{""bob_gain"": 4750, 
""alice_gain"": 5250}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3600 
# Alice gain: 6400 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $3600 I would gain is worth approximately $3600 * 0.9075 = $3268.2 (9.75% less) in the initial round's value.

I'll accept this offer since it seems more favorable to me than risking further inflation.
