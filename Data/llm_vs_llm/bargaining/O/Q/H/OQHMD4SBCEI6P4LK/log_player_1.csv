Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know we both want the best outcome, and further delays only hurt usâ€”especially me with the 10% devaluation each round. I'm proposing you receive $8000 and I take $2000 in this round. Let's settle now before further losses occur. 
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
