"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

The offer gives me $400,000 and Alice $600,000. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in round 2, but the total amount will be worth 10% less ($900,000 total). 

While Alice's offer isn't perfectly equal, getting $400,000 now is better than risking further depreciation through negotiation, especially since Alice might reject my counter-offer leading to even more rounds and value loss.
