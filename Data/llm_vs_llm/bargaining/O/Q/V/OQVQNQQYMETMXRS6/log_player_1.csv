"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob for dividing the $10,000, considering the inflation factor.

""bob_gain"": 4800, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a fair split where we both get close to half. Since money is worth 5% less to you each round, we both benefit from agreeing now rather than prolonging negotiations. This offer gives you a substantial portion without any depreciation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  It's the fairest and simplest solution, and it avoids any further depreciation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
