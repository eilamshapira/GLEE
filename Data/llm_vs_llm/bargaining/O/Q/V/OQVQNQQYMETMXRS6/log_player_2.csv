"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a fair split where we both get close to half. Since money is worth 5% less to you each round, we both benefit from agreeing now rather than prolonging negotiations. This offer gives you a substantial portion without any depreciation. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
