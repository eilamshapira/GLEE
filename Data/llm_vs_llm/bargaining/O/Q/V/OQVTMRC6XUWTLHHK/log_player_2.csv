"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze Alice's offer. She's proposing that out of the $100, I get $40 and she gets $60.

While this isn't an even split, it's not extremely unfair either. I could reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, but there's no guarantee Alice would accept a more favorable split for me. Also, $40 is a substantial portion of the total.
