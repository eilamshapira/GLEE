5000.0,5000.0,"Hello Bob, in Round 1 I propose we split the $10000 equally—$5000 for me and $5000 for you. Since each new round costs me a 20% loss in the money’s value, I believe locking in a fair agreement now benefits both of us. I look forward to a swift confirmation so we can both secure our gains.",Alice,1,
