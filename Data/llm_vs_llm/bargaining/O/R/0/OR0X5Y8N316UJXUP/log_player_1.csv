"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll send an offer to Bob that acknowledges the inflation difference while still providing us both with a fair share.

{""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, since you face 5% inflation per round while I don't, accepting now means you get full value of $4,500. If we delay, your share loses value while mine doesn't. This is a fair split considering our different situations.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I need to account for the inflation affecting my share. This offer considers a slight adjustment for the value loss I'm experiencing. 
# Alice gain: 5300 
# Bob gain: 4700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
