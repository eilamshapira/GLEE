Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, since you face 5% inflation per round while I don't, accepting now means you get full value of $4500. If we delay, your share loses value while mine doesn't. This is a fair split considering our different situations. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
