"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with an offer that considers the time pressure due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I receive $55 and you receive $45. Given that inflation reduces the value for me by 20% each round, I'm offering a fair split that slightly favors me now rather than risking delays that would reduce the total value for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
