"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer, taking into account the inflation factor for both of us:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

My reasoning: I'm offering Bob $40, which might seem less than half, but with his inflation rate of 20% per round, he might consider it reasonable to avoid further loss of value. I'm aiming for a slightly larger share to compensate for my own inflation. This is a starting point for negotiation."
