"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split it 60-40. This way, we both get a good share. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: I get $40
2. If I reject and propose next round:
   - The money will be worth 10% less
   - Maximum I could get in next round would be worth $90 (100 * 0.9)
   - But Alice might reject that

Given that:
1. $40 is a reasonable offer
2. The risk of losing value due to inflation is significant
3. Even if I make a more aggressive offer next round, Alice might reject it

I'll accept this offer.
