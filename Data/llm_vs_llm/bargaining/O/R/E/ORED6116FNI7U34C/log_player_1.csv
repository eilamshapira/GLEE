"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to make a proposal for dividing $10,000 between myself (Alice) and Bob. I should consider that with each passing round, the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, which means there's an incentive to reach an agreement sooner rather than later, but this also affects our bargaining power differently.

Given that I lose value faster than Bob does (20% vs 10% per round), I should make a reasonable first offer that Bob is likely to accept, while still securing a fair portion for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an equal split of the money. This is a fair starting point that acknowledges both our positions. Since I stand to lose more from delay (20% vs Bob's 10%), I want to make an equitable offer that Bob would be likely to accept immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting this offer because while I understand inflation affects me more, a 40/60 split is too far from an equitable division at this stage. Since I'll be making the next offer, I can propose something more balanced that accounts for our different inflation rates."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to make a more strategic offer now. Since we've already gone through two rounds, the inflation effect is significant - my money is worth 36% less than the original amount (20% + 20% of 80% = 36% total reduction), while Bob's is only worth 19% less (10% + 10% of 90% = 19% total reduction).

Given this asymmetric inflation impact, I should adjust my offer to incentivize Bob to accept while still getting a reasonable share.

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}

I'm offering a 45/55 split in Bob's favor. This acknowledges the inflation differential between us and offers Bob more than an equal split, which should be appealing. If we continue to another round, both of us lose more value, so this compromise should be reasonable for both parties given our current situation."
