"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer. She's proposing a 50/50 split, which gives us each $5,000.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value will decrease by 10% for me and 20% for Alice. That means we'd be dividing effectively $9,000 from my perspective and $8,000 from Alice's perspective.

Given the different inflation rates, I could potentially get a better deal for myself in the next round. However, there's also the risk of continued rejection and further devaluation.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I rejected Alice's 50/50 split, I need to make a strategic counter-offer considering our different inflation rates.

From my perspective, the $10,000 is now worth $9,000 due to my 10% inflation rate. From Alice's perspective, it's worth $8,000 due to her higher 20% inflation rate.

Given that Alice faces higher inflation, she should be more motivated to accept an offer now rather than continuing to the next round. I'll propose a division that's better for me than 50/50 but still attractive enough for Alice to accept rather than face another round of depreciation.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, 
""alice_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering Alice $4,000, which is 40% of the original amount. This is still a significant portion, and given her 20% inflation rate per round, she should find this more valuable than risking another round of depreciation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer considering the inflation rates.

Alice is offering me $5,500 (55% of the original $10,000) and keeping $4,500 (45%) for herself.

Due to inflation, for me this $5,500 is worth only 81% of its original value, so effectively $5,500 Ã— 0.81 = $4,455 in round 1 terms.

If I reject and we move to round 4, my inflation would increase further to approximately 27% (another 10% loss), and Alice's would increase to about 49% (another 20% loss).

Given that Alice has increased her offer to me from the original 50/50 split to 55/45 in my favor, and considering the continued devaluation if we keep negotiating, this appears to be a reasonable compromise.
