Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the inflation concerns, I'll propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This allows us both to benefit more than the last offer. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
