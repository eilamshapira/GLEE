"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
``` 
Reasoning:

- **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing each round. It's crucial to secure a deal sooner rather than later.
- **Shift in Proposal:** Bob's offer in Round 2 (45/55) suggests he might be willing to accept a slightly smaller share than initially proposed. 
- **Time Pressure:**  While I don't know how inflation affects Bob, the longer the game goes, the worse any potential offer gets for me. 

By proposing 55/45, I'm:

1. Aiming for a slightly better deal than Bob offered.
2. Signaling a willingness to compromise, potentially avoiding further rounds of devaluation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Reasoning:

- **Significant Inflation:**  The money is now worth 27.1% less than at the start. Accepting even a 40/60 split is better than risking another round of devaluation.
- **Downward Trend:** Bob's offers have decreased from 45 to 40. If this trend continues, his next offer may be even lower.
- **Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee Bob will offer a better deal in the future. He might be very patient or unaffected by inflation.

While not ideal, accepting a 40/60 split now minimizes potential losses due to inflation."
