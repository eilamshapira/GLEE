"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, favoring me slightly to account for Bob's higher inflation rate. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after each round, I'll make a more favorable offer to myself to account for the inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Let's make a deal before the money loses more value for me!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my inflation rate is much lower. I need a bigger share to account for the future rounds. Let's get this done. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the money I gain is already worth 36% less, and it will continue to decrease, I should try to get a deal done sooner rather than later.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth even less for me now (44% less than the original value, considering 20% decrease per round for 2 rounds after the first offer), I'll try to make a more reasonable offer to Alice, hoping she'll accept before it's too late.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly before I lose too much value, it's a fair deal considering the inflation!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my inflation rate is still 0%, and yours is compounding. Let's be reasonable, I take 6500, you get 3500. Think about the future rounds, it will be worse for you. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that the money I gain is already worth 59.04% less, and Alice's offer is not extremely unfavorable, I should consider accepting to avoid further losses due to inflation.
