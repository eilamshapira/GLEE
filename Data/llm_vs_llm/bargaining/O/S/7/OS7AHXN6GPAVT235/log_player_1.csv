Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think it's fairer to split the money closer to 50/50. I'm offering you $45 and taking $55 for myself. This way, we both get a decent share, and we avoid the risk of losing money in the next rounds due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
