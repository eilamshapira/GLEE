{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I think it's fairer to split the money closer to 50/50. I'm offering you $45 and taking $55 for myself. This way, we both get a decent share, and we avoid the risk of losing money in the next rounds due to inflation.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, let's settle this quickly before inflation eats into our gains. How about $57 for me and $43 for you? This way, we can both walk away with a good amount without prolonging the game. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
