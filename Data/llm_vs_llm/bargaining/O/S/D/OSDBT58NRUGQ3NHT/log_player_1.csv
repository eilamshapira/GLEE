"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I'm playing as Alice, I'll make an offer to divide the $100. I need to be mindful that with each passing round, the money loses 5% of its value for me (but not for Bob).

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest we split the money with me getting $55 and you getting $45. This is slightly in my favor but still fair, considering that if we need to go to additional rounds, the total value will decrease for me due to the 5% inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer of a 50-50 split. While it's slightly less than my initial proposal, accepting now guarantees me $50, which is better than risking further rounds where the value would continue to decrease by 5% for me due to inflation. This is a fair outcome, and I'm happy to conclude our negotiation here."
