Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split of the money. This gives us both substantial amounts and is the most equitable division."

# Alice gain: 650000

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000}

I'm proposing a slight adjustment to account for the inflation that affects me. This is a fair division considering that my share loses value with each round while yours doesn't."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing this division to account for the increasing inflation effect on my share. Since my money loses value with each round (now over 18% less valuable) while yours doesn't, this adjustment makes the effective value more balanced."
