"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to avoid the 10% inflation penalty from further rounds.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's split the amount evenly at 50-50. It's a fair deal, and we can avoid further inflation penalties. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. In this round, my $500,000 would be worth 10% less = $450,000 in round 1 value
2. Bob's first round proposal was worse for me than my initial offer ($600,000)
3. If I reject and make a new offer next round, my money will be worth another 10% less
4. Since I don't know Bob's future behavior, getting $450,000 in effective value now might be better than risking further rounds
