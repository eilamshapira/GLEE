555556.0,444444.0,"Hi Bob, I'd like to propose a fair split given the time‚Äêdiscounting effects we face. In round 1, before any depreciation for me, I suggest I receive $555556 while you get $444444. This division reflects the equilibrium outcome (assuming we both discount future money similarly), and it helps us avoid further loss through inflation. I hope you find this offer acceptable so we can both walk away with a good deal!",Alice,1,
