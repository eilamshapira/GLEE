"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 555556, ""bob_gain"": 444444, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'd like to propose a fair split given the time‚Äêdiscounting effects we face. In round 1, before any depreciation for me, I suggest I receive $555,556 while you get $444,444. This division reflects the equilibrium outcome (assuming we both discount future money similarly), and it helps us avoid further loss through inflation. I hope you find this offer acceptable so we can both walk away with a good deal!""}"
