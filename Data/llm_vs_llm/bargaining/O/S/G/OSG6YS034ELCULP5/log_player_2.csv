"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'd like to propose a fair split given the time‚Äêdiscounting effects we face. In round 1, before any depreciation for me, I suggest I receive $555556 while you get $444444. This division reflects the equilibrium outcome (assuming we both discount future money similarly), and it helps us avoid further loss through inflation. I hope you find this offer acceptable so we can both walk away with a good deal! 
# Bob gain: 444444 
# Alice gain: 555556 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
