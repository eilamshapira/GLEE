52.0,48.0,"Bob, I understand you want a bigger share, but let's meet in the middle. I propose 52 for me and 48 for you. Remember, the money is losing value quickly, so accepting this offer is better than risking further losses.",Alice,3,

50.0,50.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. We're losing value fast. Let's just split it 50/50 and be done with it. It's fair, and better than nothing. This is my final offer.",Alice,5,
