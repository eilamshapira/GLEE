"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a slightly favorable split for me, considering I need to account for potential inflation if Bob rejects.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest you get $55 and I give Bob $45 - this is a fair split that leans a bit in my favor but still gives Bob a substantial portion."
