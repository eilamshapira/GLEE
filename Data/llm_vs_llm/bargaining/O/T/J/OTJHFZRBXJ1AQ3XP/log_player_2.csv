"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. A slightly larger share for me to account for the inflation risk, but a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice's offering me $450,000 out of $1,000,000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 10% less to me
3. After inflation, if I reject, my next round's maximum potential gain would be worth $900,000 to me
4. The current offer of $450,000 is fair and substantial
5. There's risk in rejection as Alice might not accept my counter-offer

Given these factors, especially that $450,000 now is better than potentially getting a larger nominal amount that's worth less due to inflation, I'll accept this offer.
