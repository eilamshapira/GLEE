"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose I get $60 and you get $40. This is a fair split considering the uncertainty of future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing that I get $40 out of the $100. If I reject and we go to the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation, meaning the entire $100 would effectively be worth $80 to me. This means even if I got all $100 in the next round (which is unlikely), it would only be worth $80 to me now.

Given that I can secure $40 now versus an uncertain amount in the next round with a 20% penalty, I think I should accept this offer.
