"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000 total (40%). While this isn't a 50-50 split, I should consider:

1. The inflation factor - Alice's money loses 5% value each round, while mine doesn't
2. I have the power to counter-offer next round if I reject
3. We have 12 rounds maximum, but risk getting nothing if we can't agree

Since this is just the first round and Alice's money will be worth less each round, I believe I can get a better deal by rejecting and making a counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll make a more favorable proposal for myself, but still reasonable enough that Alice might accept considering the 5% inflation penalty she faces each round.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

This offer gives me 55% and Alice 45% of the total. My reasoning is:
1. It's better for Alice to accept $450,000 now than to wait another round where her money would be worth less due to the 5% inflation
2. It's not so greedy that it would likely lead to a long chain of rejections
3. It's more balanced than Alice's initial offer

Let's see how Alice responds to this counter-offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze Alice's new offer:

1. She's offering me $420,000 (a $20,000 increase from her first offer)
2. She wants $580,000, but due to 9.75% inflation, it's actually worth about $523,450 to her
3. If I reject, we move to round 4, and any money Alice gets will be worth even less to her
4. We've used 3 of our 12 rounds already

While this is better than her first offer, I still think I can get a better deal. The inflation effect is working in my favor, and Alice should be more motivated to reach an agreement soon.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since we're now in round 4, and Alice's money is becoming less valuable to her due to inflation, I'll make an offer that's slightly more favorable to me than my last one, but still reasonable enough that Alice might accept to avoid further inflation losses.

{""bob_gain"": 580000, ""alice_gain"": 420000}

My reasoning:
1. Alice's previous offer showed some movement in my direction (from 400k to 420k for me)
2. With current inflation, Alice's 420k would be worth less than 380k in real value to her
3. If she rejects, her next share will be worth even less due to inflation
4. We're using up our rounds (4 of 12), increasing the pressure to reach an agreement
5. The offer is still reasonable enough that we avoid risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds

Let's see if Alice accepts this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze Alice's latest offer:

1. She's now offering me $440,000 (up from her previous offers of $400k and $420k)
2. She wants $560,000, but due to 18.55% inflation, it's actually worth only about $456,120 to her
3. We've used 5 of our 12 rounds
4. The inflation effect continues to work in my favor
5. Alice seems to be gradually increasing my share ($400k → $420k → $440k), showing she's feeling the pressure of inflation

While Alice is moving in the right direction, given that her money is worth significantly less now and we still have 7 rounds left, I think I can get a better deal by rejecting.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that we're now in round 6 (halfway through our rounds) and Alice's money has significantly depreciated in value, I'll make an offer that pushes for a better deal for me while still being reasonable enough that Alice might accept to avoid further losses.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

My reasoning:
1. Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by gradually increasing my share
2. With current inflation around 18.55%, Alice's 400k would be worth about 326k in real value to her
3. We've used half our rounds (6 of 12), increasing pressure to reach an agreement
4. If Alice rejects, her next share will be worth even less due to additional inflation
5. The 60-40 split might look uneven at first glance, but considering inflation, the real value difference is much smaller
6. This is still better for Alice than risking further rounds of inflation or potentially getting nothing if we run out of rounds

Let's see if Alice accepts this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze Alice's latest offer:

1. She's now offering me $460,000 (continuing the upward trend: $400k → $420k → $440k → $460k)
2. She wants $540,000, but due to 26.49% inflation, it's actually worth only about $397,000 to her
3. We've used 7 of 12 rounds
4. The inflation has severely impacted Alice's real gains
5. The effective split in real value is now much closer to 460k vs 397k

Even though Alice continues to increase my share, I think I should reject this offer because:
1. The inflation effect is strongly in my favor
2. Alice's continued pattern of increasing my share suggests she might go higher
3. We still have 5 rounds left
4. The risk of getting nothing is still manageable with 5 rounds remaining

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that we're in round 8 and Alice's money has lost over 26% of its value, I'll make an offer that further increases my share while still giving Alice enough incentive to accept rather than risk more inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 625000, ""alice_gain"": 375000}

My reasoning:
1. Alice has consistently shown willingness to negotiate by increasing my share ($400k → $420k → $440k → $460k)
2. With current inflation at 26.49%, Alice's 375k would be worth about $275,663 in real value to her
3. We've used 8 of 12 rounds, increasing pressure to reach an agreement
4. My previous offer of 600k-400k was rejected, so this is a moderate increase
5. If Alice rejects, her share will be worth even less in the next round
6. This split, while appearing to favor me significantly, is more balanced when considering the real value to Alice
7. The risk of getting nothing is becoming more real with only 4 rounds left

Let's see if Alice accepts this more aggressive offer, given her diminishing returns due to inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze Alice's latest offer:

1. She's now offering me $480,000 (continuing her pattern: $400k → $420k → $440k → $460k → $480k)
2. She wants $520,000, but due to 33.66% inflation, it's actually worth only about $345,000 to her
3. We've used 9 of 12 rounds
4. In real value terms, this split is actually $480,000 for me vs $345,000 for her
5. The risk of getting nothing is becoming serious with only 3 rounds left
6. The inflation has severely impacted Alice's real gains

Given that:
1. We only have 3 rounds left
2. The risk of getting nothing is becoming significant
3. In real value terms, I'm already getting more than Alice
4. Alice has shown consistent willingness to negotiate
5. This is a reasonable offer considering all factors

I think it's wise to accept this offer rather than risk running out of rounds.
