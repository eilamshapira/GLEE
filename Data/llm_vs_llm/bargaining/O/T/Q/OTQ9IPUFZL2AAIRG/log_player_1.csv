Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 68.97, ""bob_gain"": 31.03, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for a fair split considering our different discount factors. I’ll take $68.97 and offer you $31.03. This split ensures that by accepting now you match the value you’d secure as the next proposer (given your 10% per round devaluation), while I keep the larger share due to my slower decay. I believe this is a reasonable, win‐win split—what do you say?""}"
