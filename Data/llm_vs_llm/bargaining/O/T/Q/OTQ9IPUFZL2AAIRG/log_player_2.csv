"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for a fair split considering our different discount factors. I’ll take $68.97 and offer you $31.03. This split ensures that by accepting now you match the value you’d secure as the next proposer (given your 10% per round devaluation), while I keep the larger share due to my slower decay. I believe this is a reasonable, win‐win split—what do you say? 
# Bob gain: 31.03 
# Alice gain: 68.97 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's proposal carefully. 

Alice is offering me $31.03 now, while keeping $68.97 for herself. She claims this is fair due to our different discount rates (my 10% vs her 5%).

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value decreases by 10% for me, meaning the $100 would be worth only $90 to me. This would limit my maximum possible gain in the next round.

Let me check if Alice's math is correct. If I reject this offer, I'd propose next round, but Alice could reject that offer too. Given our discount rates, accepting $31.03 now might be mathematically equivalent to the expected outcome of continuing the game.

Since Alice has provided a reasoned explanation based on our different discount factors, and the amount offered appears to consider these factors, I'll accept.
