Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose an equal 50-50 split, which is fair to both of us. Neither of us has any inherent claim to a larger share, so an even division seems most reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
