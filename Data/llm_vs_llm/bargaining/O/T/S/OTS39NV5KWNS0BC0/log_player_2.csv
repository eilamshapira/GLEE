"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take the lion's share, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing to take 90% of the money ($900,000) while giving me only 10% ($100,000). While I appreciate her being open to negotiation, this is a very uneven split that heavily favors her.

Since this is just the first round and I'll have the opportunity to make a counter-proposal if I reject, I believe I should try to negotiate for a more equitable distribution.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""I propose an equal 50-50 split, which is fair to both of us. Neither of us has any inherent claim to a larger share, so an even division seems most reasonable.""}"
