Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your previous offer, but I believe a 60/40 split is more reflective of the value I bring to the table.  Let's close this deal and avoid further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer for round 3, considering the inflation:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 62,
  ""bob_gain"": 38,
  ""message"": ""Bob, inflation is hitting us both hard. I'm offering 62/38 now. This accounts for the value decrease and gives you a reasonable amount. Let's finalize this before the money loses even more value!""
