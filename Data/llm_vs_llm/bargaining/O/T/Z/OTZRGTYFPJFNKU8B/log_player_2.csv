{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your previous offer, but I believe a 60/40 split is more reflective of the value I bring to the table.  Let's close this deal and avoid further inflation.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, inflation is hitting us both hard. I'm offering 62/38 now. This accounts for the value decrease and gives you a reasonable amount. Let's finalize this before the money loses even more value! 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
