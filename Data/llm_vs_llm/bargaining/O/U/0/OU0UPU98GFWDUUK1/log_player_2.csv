"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While a 50/50 split seems fair, I'm willing to gamble that Alice will be more motivated to avoid losing money to inflation as the game progresses. I'm hoping for a better offer in a later round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Although not ideal, this offer is better than my previous one, considering the inflation. Accepting now secures a reasonable amount before the value decreases further."
