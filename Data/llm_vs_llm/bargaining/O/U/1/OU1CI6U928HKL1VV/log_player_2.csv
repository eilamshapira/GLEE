Round 7

Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the real value of the offer for Bob after accounting for inflation:

The nominal value of the offer for Bob is $4750.
The inflation rate for Bob is 26.49%.

Real value for Bob = Nominal value / (1 + Inflation rate)
= $4750 / (1 + 0.2649)
= $4750 / 1.2649
= $3753.68

Given that the real value of the offer is $3753.68, let's accept the offer to secure some money before the value decreases further.
