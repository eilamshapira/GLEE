"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a division that accounts for the 20% per round inflation penalty I face. Since Bob doesn't face inflation, he might be more patient, but I'll try to make a fair initial offer that he's likely to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this 60-40 split because it's favorable enough for me to protect against inflation if negotiations continue, while still being fair enough that Bob might accept it. If he rejects and we go to round 2, my $6000 would only be worth $4800 to me due to 20% inflation."
