"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Alice is offering a 60-40 split in her favor
2. The current offer would give me $400,000
3. If I reject, the money will be worth 10% less for me in the next round
4. In the next round, even if I propose a 50-50 split ($500,000 each), my share would be worth $450,000 due to 10% inflation
5. Any further negotiations would lead to even more value loss for me

Given that my best possible counter-offer would still be worth less than the current offer due to inflation, and that Alice's offer isn't entirely unreasonable, I should accept.
