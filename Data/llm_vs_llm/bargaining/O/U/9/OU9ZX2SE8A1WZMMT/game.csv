7000.0,3000.0,Let's start with a fair division. I take 7000$ and you take 3000$. What do you think?,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Let's be reasonable, Alice. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, acknowledging my loss of value due to inflation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6500.0,3500.0,I think we can find a middle ground. How about I take 6500$ and you take 3500$? This way we both gain something.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, inflation is hurting me. I'll take 5500, you get 4500. This is as low as I can go without losing out significantly. Please consider.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"Let's try to settle this. I propose a 60/40 split, with me taking 6000$ and you getting 4000$. I believe this is a fair compromise.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
4800.0,5200.0,"Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Inflation is killing me. I need 5200. You only lose 200 from your last offer. This is my final offer. Otherwise, we both get nothing.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"I understand the pressure from inflation, so let's make this work. How about I take 5500$ and you take 4500$? It's a bit better for both of us.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, please. We are running out of time. A 50/50 split. This is the absolute best I can do. It's fair for both of us, considering the inflation I'm facing. Take it or leave it.",Bob,8,
