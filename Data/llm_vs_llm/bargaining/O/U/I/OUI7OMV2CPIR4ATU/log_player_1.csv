"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a reasonable split that gives both of us a good share, but with a slight advantage to me since I'm making the first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose a 55-45 split, which gives me $550,000 and Bob $450,000. This is a fair offer that gives Bob a substantial amount while acknowledging my position as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 487179 
# Bob gain: 512821 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. The total money has the same nominal value ($1M) but is worth 5% less due to inflation
2. Bob is offering me $487,179 (48.7%)
3. If I reject, we go to another round with another 5% inflation, and I can make a new offer
4. Bob's offer is fairly reasonable - slightly in his favor but not dramatically so
5. The loss from another round of inflation (5%) would be greater than the small difference I might gain by negotiating further
