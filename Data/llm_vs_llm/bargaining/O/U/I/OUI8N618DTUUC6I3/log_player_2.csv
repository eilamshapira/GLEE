"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me $40 out of $100. If I reject and we go to the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me, meaning my $40 would become effectively worth $32. To make rejecting worthwhile, I'd need to be confident I could get significantly more than $50 in the next round to offset this loss.

Given that:
1. The inflation penalty is significant (20% per round)
2. We have a limited number of rounds (12)
3. I don't know how inflation affects Alice
4. A 40-60 split isn't terribly unfair

I think it's better to accept this reasonable offer rather than risk getting less due to inflation or potential breakdown of negotiations.
