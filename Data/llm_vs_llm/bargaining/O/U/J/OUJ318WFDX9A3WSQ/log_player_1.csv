"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I should approach this game strategically, considering the 20% inflation on my side per round.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I suggest we split the money with me getting $60 and you getting $40. This is a reasonable offer that gives you a significant portion while recognizing that I'm affected by inflation each round. If we delay too long, the money will be worth much less to me, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement promptly."
