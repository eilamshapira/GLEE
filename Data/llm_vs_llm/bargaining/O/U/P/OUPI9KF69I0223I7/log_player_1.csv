"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose a split of 520K for me and 480K for you. With every passing round my share loses 5% of its value, so settling now benefits both of us by avoiding further delays. I believe this nearly even split reflects a fair compromise. Please accept. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
