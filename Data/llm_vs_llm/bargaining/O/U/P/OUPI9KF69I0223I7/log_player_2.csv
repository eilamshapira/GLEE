Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Alice, I propose a split of 520K for me and 480K for you. With every passing round my share loses 5% of its value, so settling now benefits both of us by avoiding further delays. I believe this nearly even split reflects a fair compromise. Please accept.""}"
