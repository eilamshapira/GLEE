"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000, which is 40%. If I reject, I'll make a counter-offer in the next round, but I need to factor in that the money will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation.

If I reject and we go to round 2, the $1,000,000 will effectively be worth $900,000 to me. Even if I were to propose a more favorable split for myself in the next round, I'd need to consider that Alice might reject it too, leading to further rounds and more inflation.

While I could try for more, $400,000 is a substantial amount, and the risk of ending up with less or nothing due to continued negotiations makes this a reasonable offer to accept.
