"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1. I'll try to be fair but also leave myself with a decent amount considering I'm the one making the first offer.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I will analyze Bob's offer.

*   **Bob's Offer:** Alice: $500,000, Bob: $500,000

Here's my thought process:

*   The total amount is still $1,000,000, but the value is less than round 1
*   My previous offer was $600,000, which Bob rejected.
*   If I reject, the amount will decrease by 10%, and I don't know what Bob will offer next round.

Given the circumstances, I will accept the offer.

""decision"": ""accept""
