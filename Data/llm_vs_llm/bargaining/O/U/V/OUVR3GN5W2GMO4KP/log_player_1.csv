"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement quickly due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation affecting my share, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This way, we can still reach a quick agreement that's fair to both of us. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

If I accept Bob's offer of $45, due to 20% inflation, it's actually worth $36 to me.
Bob's $55 share would be worth $49.5 to him (with 10% inflation).

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, my share would be worth even less due to inflation. The longer this goes, the less we both get.

While this isn't ideal, getting $36 in real value now is better than risking further devaluation in future rounds.
