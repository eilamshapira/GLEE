"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400001 
# Alice gain: 599999 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering me $400,001 while keeping $599,999 for herself. This is not an equal division. Since there's no inflation penalty for me (0% per round), I have no pressure to accept an unfair offer. If I make a counter-offer in the next round, Alice will face 10% inflation on her value.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more equitable offer that also accounts for Alice's time-sensitivity due to inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 525000, ""alice_gain"": 475000}

I'm proposing that I receive $525,000 and Alice receives $475,000. This is a fair offer considering that Alice faces 10% inflation per round, so she should have incentive to accept this offer now rather than continuing to negotiate and losing value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 462500 
# Alice gain: 537500 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has increased her offer to me from $400,001 to $462,500, which is an improvement but still not optimal from my perspective. Since I don't face any inflation penalty (0%), I can continue negotiating without losing value, while Alice is already experiencing a 19% inflation penalty.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice rejected my previous offer and is now facing higher inflation (27.1% if she rejects this offer), I'll make a slightly better offer for her than my previous one, but still favorable to me since I have the time advantage.

{""bob_gain"": 510000, ""alice_gain"": 490000}

I'm proposing that I receive $510,000 and Alice receives $490,000. This is a reasonable offer considering that Alice faces 10% additional inflation each round. If she rejects this offer, her next round's money will be worth 27.1% less than the original value, significantly diminishing what she ultimately receives."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has actually decreased her offer to me from $462,500 to $440,000, which is moving in the wrong direction. Given that I face no inflation penalty and Alice is now experiencing a 34.39% inflation penalty, I can continue to negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Alice has now rejected two of my offers and is facing significant inflation (40.95% if she rejects this offer). I'll adjust my offer slightly to make it more likely she accepts, while still maintaining an advantage due to my stronger position.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing an equal split - I receive $500,000 and Alice receives $500,000. This is a perfectly fair division that should be appealing to Alice given her significant inflation penalty. If she rejects this offer, her next round's money will be worth 40.95% less than the original value, meaning her $560,000 counter-offer would only be worth about $330,000 in original value to her. An equal split now is much better for her than continuing to negotiate."
