"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","For the first round, I'll make a reasonable offer. Since we have 12 rounds to divide the money, I'll start by offering a split that's slightly in my favor, but still leaves a significant amount for Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 487189 
# Bob gain: 512811 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less, the actual values are:
Alice gain: 487189
Bob gain: 512811

Considering the reduced value due to inflation, I'll evaluate Bob's offer. It seems like a relatively fair split, but slightly in his favor.
