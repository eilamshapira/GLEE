"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a reasonable offer that gives me a slight advantage but is still fair to Bob, considering I need to account for potential inflation if he refuses.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose to take $60 and give Bob $40. This is a fair starting point that gives both of us a meaningful share while giving me a slight advantage as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. With 20% inflation for me, if I accept $35 now, it's actually worth $28 to me (35 * 0.8)
2. If I reject, I can make another offer next round, but then I'll face 40% total inflation
3. Bob's current offer gives him most of the money ($65), and it's quite unfavorable to me
4. I still have many rounds left to negotiate, and this offer is too low

{""decision"": ""reject""}

The offer is too unfavorable for me. I'll take my chances with making a counter-offer in the next round, even with increased inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that I now face 40% inflation on my portion, and knowing that Bob faces less inflation than I do, I need to adjust my strategy. I'll increase my initial ask to compensate for the inflation impact while still keeping it reasonable enough that Bob might accept.

{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}

I propose this division because with 40% inflation, my $75 would actually be worth $45 to me (75 * 0.6), which is more reasonable than it might appear at first glance. Since Bob has lower inflation, the $25 might still be attractive enough for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
1. If I accept $40 now, with 48.8% inflation, it's actually worth $20.48 to me (40 * 0.512)
2. If I reject, my next offer will face even higher inflation (around 59% inflation)
3. This offer from Bob is slightly better than his previous offer ($35)
4. We're now in round 4 out of 12, and the inflation gap between us is growing
5. Given Bob's lower inflation rate, he seems to have more negotiating power

While this isn't an ideal offer, the growing inflation differential means my position will continue to weaken. The offer is better than his last one, and further delays might hurt me more than help.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept this offer because further negotiation rounds will likely result in even less real value for me due to the asymmetric inflation rates."
