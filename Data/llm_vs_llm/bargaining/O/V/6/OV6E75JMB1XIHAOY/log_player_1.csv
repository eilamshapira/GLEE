"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a split that takes into account the inflation pressure on both players, while being fair enough to likely get accepted. Since Bob's inflation penalty is higher (20% vs 10%), he has more incentive to accept an early deal.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, offering Bob a substantial $400,000 while keeping $600,000 for myself. This is a reasonable first offer that acknowledges both players' need to reach an agreement before inflation erodes the value significantly."
