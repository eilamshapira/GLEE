"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $400,000 for me, $600,000 for Alice
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to inflation:
   - My money will be worth 20% less next round
   - Alice's money will be worth 10% less next round
4. That means if I reject, my $400,000 now would only be worth $320,000 in purchasing power next round
5. While 60-40 split isn't ideal, losing 20% value might make me worse off

Given that:
- The inflation rate works against me more than Alice (20% vs 10%)
- There's no guarantee Alice would accept a better offer from me
- Getting $400,000 now is better than potentially getting slightly more but worth less later
