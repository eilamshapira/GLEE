"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I want to start with a fair offer, considering Bob's money depreciates faster.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob is offering a 50/50 split. While it's less than I initially proposed, the value of the money hasn't decreased for me, so it's still a reasonable offer considering it was rejected before.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
