"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to propose a split for $100 in the first round. Since I'm Alice, I should consider that inflation affects me more severely (20% per round) than Bob (5% per round). This means delaying agreement hurts me more, so I should try to make a reasonable first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose we split the money $60 for me and $40 for you. This is a fair offer considering that if we delay, inflation will reduce the total value for both of us, and it hurts me more than you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer. While I'm getting less than my initial proposal, accepting now is better than continuing negotiations with the significant inflation penalty I face (20% per round). If I reject and we continue to another round, my share would lose more value quickly, making this a reasonable compromise to conclude the game."
