"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice's offer gives me a fair amount, I can potentially get a better deal especially considering Alice's money loses value faster than mine with each round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a counteroffer that takes into account our different inflation rates while trying to be fair.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'd like to propose a 55/45 split in our favor. Since your money loses value faster (20% per round vs my 5%), we should reach an agreement quickly, and this split gives both of us a substantial portion."
