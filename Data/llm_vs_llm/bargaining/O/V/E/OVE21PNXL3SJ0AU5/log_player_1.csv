"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's aim for a more balanced split, considering the decreasing value of money in each round. It's in our best interest to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. 
# Alice gain: 47.5 
# Bob gain: 52.5 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
