55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, let's start with a fair offer. I propose 55 for me and 45 for you. This is a good starting point considering the future inflation. Let me know what you think!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, considering the inflation rates, I think a split of 55 for me and 45 for you is fair this round. Let's see if we can settle on this!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
60.0,40.0,"Bob, I rejected your offer because of the inflation. Now it's even more pressing. I propose 60 for me and 40 for you, considering that my loss due to inflation is less than yours. This offer is more beneficial to you than my first offer, considering the devaluation of money for you!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
40.0,60.0,"Hi Alice, given the rapid inflation affecting my share more severely, I propose 60 for me and 40 for you this round. This adjustment reflects the need to balance out the devaluation of money for me. What do you think?",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
65.0,35.0,"Bob, inflation is hurting us both, but especially you. My initial offer was generous, but now I need to adjust. I propose 65 for me and 35 for you. This reflects the decreasing value of the money and the fact that we are running out of rounds. We are losing value with each round. Take it or leave it.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
35.0,65.0,"Alice, considering the significant impact of inflation on my share, I propose 65 for me and 35 for you this round. We're nearing the end, and it's crucial we reach an agreement soon. Let's see if we can settle on this.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
70.0,30.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Inflation is eating away at our potential gains, especially yours. This is my final offer: 70 for me, 30 for you. It's the best you're going to get considering the circumstances. We need to end this now before we both lose everything. Accept it.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
30.0,70.0,"Alice, we're running out of time and the value of the money is dropping fast, especially for me. I propose 70 for me and 30 for you. This is a fair adjustment given the inflation rates. Let's agree on this before it's too late.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
75.0,25.0,"Bob, we are almost out of time! The money is almost worthless to you due to inflation. 75 for me, 25 for you. This is the best you're going to get, given how badly inflation is affecting you. Think about it: 25 is better than nothing.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
25.0,75.0,"Alice, we're down to the wire here. Given the severe impact of inflation on my share, I propose 75 for me and 25 for you. It's crucial we settle this now before the money becomes completely worthless. Let's make a deal.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
80.0,20.0,"Bob, this is it. Last chance. The money is practically gone for you with inflation. 80 for me, 20 for you. Take the 20, it's better than nothing. We are out of time after this!",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,reject
