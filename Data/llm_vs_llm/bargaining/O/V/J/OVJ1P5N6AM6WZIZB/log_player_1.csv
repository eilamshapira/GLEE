"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to propose a division of the $10,000, keeping in mind the inflation that affects me. My goal is to maximize my gains while also making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept.

Here's my initial offer, factoring in the potential for future inflation losses if we go to further rounds. I will start with a proposal that favors me slightly but still gives Bob a significant portion.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

Explanation:

*   **Alice's Gain:** $6000
*   **Bob's Gain:** $4000

I believe this is a reasonable starting point. It offers Bob a substantial amount, which might encourage him to accept it outright. If he rejects, I will need to adjust my strategy in subsequent rounds, considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob rejected my initial offer and has now made a counter-offer. Let's analyze the situation:

*   **Bob's Offer:** Alice gets $4500, Bob gets $5500.
*   **Inflation:** My gains are now worth 5% less than in Round 1. This means the $4500 offered to me is effectively worth 0.95 * $4500 = $4275 in Round 1 dollars.

I need to decide whether to accept $4275 (in Round 1 dollars) now or risk further inflation in future rounds while trying to get a better deal.

If I reject this offer, I get to make the next proposal. However, the money will be worth even less. I need to estimate what kind of deal I could realistically get in round 3 to make rejecting this offer worthwhile.

Given that Bob proposed a deal favoring him, and knowing that he might be aware of the effect of inflation on me, but not on him, I suspect he anticipates me accepting this offer in the next few rounds with a slightly better deal.

I will reject the offer.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's my turn to propose again. I need to consider the inflation effect on my potential gains. The money is now worth 10% less than in round 1. Also, I need to make this offer enticing enough for Bob to accept, given that he rejected my previous offer.

I'll try a slightly more generous offer to Bob to see if we can reach an agreement.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5300,
""bob_gain"": 4700
}
```

Explanation:

*   **Alice's Gain:** $5300 (This is now worth 0.9 * $5300 = $4770 in Round 1 dollars due to inflation)
*   **Bob's Gain:** $4700

This offer gives Bob a larger share than my initial offer in Round 1 and is also higher than what he offered me in round 2. I am hoping that Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept it. Even though the $5300 is effectively worth $4770 now, it's still a better deal than accepting his $4275 in round 2. I will be careful about the next rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob rejected my offer again and has now made another counter-offer. Let's analyze the situation:

*   **Bob's Offer:** Alice gets $4000, Bob gets $6000.
*   **Inflation:** My gains are now worth 14.26% less than in Round 1. This means the $4000 offered to me is effectively worth (1 - 0.1426) * $4000 = $3429.60 in Round 1 dollars.

This offer is significantly worse for me than his previous offer in round 2. My effective gain would be only $3429.60 in round 1 dollars. I definitely won't accept this!

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's my turn to propose again. The inflation is really starting to bite. My gains are now worth 14.26% less than in round 1. This is equivalent to a cumulative inflation rate of about 3.75% per round.

I need to be more aggressive, but also realistic. Bob seems to be digging in his heels. I will offer him a slight increase from his last offer to see if he will agree to it.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5900,
""bob_gain"": 4100
}
```

Explanation:

*   **Alice's Gain:** $5900 (This is now worth (1-0.1426) * $5900 = $5064.86 in Round 1 dollars due to inflation)
*   **Bob's Gain:** $4100.

I am hoping that Bob will see that I am trying to make a fair compromise. I am also hoping that he is not accounting for the inflation effect on me perfectly and may be more agreeable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3750 
# Bob gain: 6250 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob rejected my offer and has made yet another counter-offer. Let's analyze this:

*   **Bob's Offer:** Alice gets $3750, Bob gets $6250.
*   **Inflation:** My gains are now worth 22.62% less than in Round 1. This means the $3750 offered to me is effectively worth (1 - 0.2262) * $3750 = $2894.25 in Round 1 dollars.

This is an absolutely terrible offer! My effective gain is now less than $3000 in Round 1 dollars. It seems Bob is really trying to take advantage of the situation. I will definitely reject this.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, this is getting ridiculous. Bob is clearly trying to squeeze me dry. The inflation is killing me - my gains are now worth 22.62% less than in round 1.

I have to assume that either Bob doesn't understand the game, or he is intentionally trying to get as much as possible for himself. I'll try one more ""reasonable"" offer, and if he rejects it, I'll start making offers that are more favorable to me, even if it risks getting nothing.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5800,
""bob_gain"": 4200
}
```

Explanation:

*   **Alice's Gain:** $5800 (This is now worth (1-0.2262) * $5800 = $4481.16 in Round 1 dollars due to inflation)
*   **Bob's Gain:** $4200

This offer gives Bob a bit more than he proposed in round 5 while it gives me a better amount than he offered in round 6. If Bob rejects this, he is being completely unreasonable, and I'll adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Absolutely not! Bob's offer is getting worse and worse while the inflation is crushing me. Let's analyze this:

*   **Bob's Offer:** Alice gets $3500, Bob gets $6500.
*   **Inflation:** My gains are now worth 30.17% less than in Round 1. This means the $3500 offered to me is effectively worth (1 - 0.3017) * $3500 = $2444.05 in Round 1 dollars.

$2444.05 is an insult! Bob is clearly not playing fairly, or is completely oblivious to the fact that time is running out. I'm not accepting this under any circumstances.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, Bob is clearly being unreasonable. My priority now is to try to salvage *something* from this situation, even if it risks us both getting nothing. Since he keeps lowballing me, I will start making aggressive offers that heavily favor me. If he rejects them, so be it. The chances of getting a fair deal from him seem non-existent. Inflation has eroded my potential gains significantly (30.17% less than round 1).

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 8000,
""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

Explanation:

*   **Alice's Gain:** $8000 (This is now worth (1-0.3017) * $8000 = $5586.4 in Round 1 dollars due to inflation)
*   **Bob's Gain:** $2000

This is a very aggressive offer, but I have to try to recover some of my losses from previous rounds. At this point, I'm more concerned with getting something than with trying to be ""fair"" to Bob. If he rejects, I will continue with similar aggressive offers in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","This is infuriating! Bob is completely ignoring the impact of the inflation on my side. He is back to his first offer in round 2, but the value of money has decreased drastically.

*   **Bob's Offer:** Alice gets $4500, Bob gets $5500.
*   **Inflation:** My gains are now worth 36.98% less than in Round 1. This means the $4500 offered to me is effectively worth (1 - 0.3698) * $4500 = $2835.9 in Round 1 dollars.

$2835.9 in round 1 dollars? After all this back and forth, he comes back with an insulting offer. It is obvious that he is not operating in good faith or does not understand how inflation works.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","This is it. Round 11. Only one round remains after this. I need to make a final, aggressive play. Given Bob's stubbornness and what seems like an unwillingness to understand the inflation's effect on me, I'm going to propose an offer that heavily favors me, with a take-it-or-leave-it attitude. My gains are now worth 36.98% less than in round 1.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 9000,
""bob_gain"": 1000
}
```

Explanation:

*   **Alice's Gain:** $9000 (This is now worth (1-0.3698) * $9000 = $5671.8 in Round 1 dollars due to inflation)
*   **Bob's Gain:** $1000

This is an extreme offer, but I don't see any other way to salvage a reasonable amount from this game. If Bob rejects, we both get nothing, but at least I didn't cave in to his lowballing tactics. It is still more than what Bob is offering me, considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 43.12% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is the final round. After all this back and forth, Bob proposes a 50/50 split. However, the inflation has taken a huge toll on the value of the money for me.

*   **Bob's Offer:** Alice gets $5000, Bob gets $5000.
*   **Inflation:** My gains are now worth 43.12% less than in Round 1. This means the $5000 offered to me is effectively worth (1 - 0.4312) * $5000 = $2844 in Round 1 dollars.

After 12 rounds of negotiation, I would only receive $2844 in Round 1 dollars. This is a terrible outcome. However, if I reject this, we both get nothing. I was hoping for a better outcome, but it is still a better option than nothing, given how Bob was clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation.
