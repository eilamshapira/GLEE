This is getting risky, but I'm hoping to push for a slightly better deal."

Let's see if she bites this time.  The inflation is starting to become a significant factor."

I'm significantly lowering my demand, hoping that Alice will recognize the urgency of the situation with the increasing inflation."

This is a horrible offer, but I have to gamble. If I accept, I lose most of the money to inflation. If I reject, there's a slight chance Alice will offer something reasonable in the final round, or we both get nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 11.
Round 12
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest, and with the inflation at its highest, it's the most logical choice for both of us. Let's hope Alice sees it the same way."
