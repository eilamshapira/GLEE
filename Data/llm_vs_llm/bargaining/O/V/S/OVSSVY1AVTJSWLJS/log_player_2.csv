"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the $10000 equally. Fair for both of us! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

With Alice's offer of $5000, I would get $5000 in this round. If I reject and we move to the next round, any amount I receive will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation, while Alice faces no such penalty.

If I made a counter-offer in the next round, Alice could reject it, and we'd keep going with my value decreasing each time. Since Alice doesn't face inflation penalties, she has more leverage in later rounds.

$5000 now is better than potentially getting less value in future rounds. A 50-50 split is quite fair, and considering the inflation penalty I face, I should take this deal.
