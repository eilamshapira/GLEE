"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I need to make an offer to Bob, keeping in mind the depreciation of the money over time for both of us. In the first round, I'll aim for a beneficial split for myself, but still tempting enough for Bob to accept, considering his lower depreciation rate.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6500,
""bob_gain"": 3500
}
```

Explanation: I am proposing that I get $6,500 and Bob gets $3,500. This gives me a larger share, reflecting my initial advantage as the proposer. I hope Bob will accept this offer, considering his depreciation is lower than mine."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob is proposing a 50/50 split. Before deciding, I need to consider the depreciated value of the money for both of us.

*   **Original Value:** $10,000

*   **Round 1 Value for Alice:** $10,000

*   **Round 2 Value for Alice:** $10,000 * (1 - 0.20) = $8,000

*   **Round 1 Value for Bob:** $10,000

*   **Round 2 Value for Bob:** $10,000 * (1 - 0.05) = $9,500

Bob's offer means I get $5000, which is equivalent to $5000 / $10000 * $8000 = $4000 original value for me.
Bob gets $5000, which is equivalent to $5000 / $10000 * $9500 = $4750 original value for him.

Since I initially proposed to get 6500, this is a massive drop. It is very likely that it will only get worse for me from here on. I will accept this offer.
