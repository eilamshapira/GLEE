"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $600,000 and giving Bob $400,000, with a message suggesting that this is a fair starting point. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's make it 60/40 in my favor this time. It's still fair and we both get a good deal. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effects in mind, I'll consider Bob's offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, the $400,000 Bob is offering me is actually worth $400,000 * 0.9 = $360,000 to me.

As for Bob, the money he gains is worth 20% less, so the $600,000 he's proposing to take is actually worth $600,000 * 0.8 = $480,000 to him.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is not in my favor. I'd like to negotiate further.

My response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Considering the inflation effects, the total amount of $1,000,000 is now worth $1,000,000 * 0.9 * 0.9 = $810,000 to me (10% less for two rounds).

I'll make a new offer, taking into account the decreased value of the money. I'll aim for a more even split this time.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 55/45 is a fair split considering the circumstances.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $450,000 and giving Bob $550,000, with a message suggesting that this split is reasonable given the current situation. Let's see how Bob responds!"
