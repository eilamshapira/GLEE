"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $600,000 and giving Bob $400,000, with a message suggesting that this is a fair starting point. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more reasonable given the circumstances. Let's settle this fairly. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I need to consider that when evaluating Bob's offer.

Bob's offer gives me $450,000, but due to inflation, its value is reduced by 10%, making it equivalent to $405,000 (90% of $450,000).

Considering this, I think I can do better. I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less in each round, I need to make a more favorable offer to myself to compensate for the inflation.

In Round 2, the value of my gain was reduced by 10%. Now, in Round 3, it will be reduced by another 10%, making it 90% * 90% = 81% of the original value.

To account for this, I'll make an offer that gives me a larger share:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 650000,
  ""bob_gain"": 350000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I need a better deal. Let's settle this before it's too late!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $650,000 and giving Bob $350,000, with a message that highlights the urgency of making a deal due to the inflation. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the inflation affecting your share, a 50/50 split seems fair and equitable. Let's end this on a balanced note. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I need to consider that when evaluating Bob's offer.

Bob's offer gives me $500,000, but due to inflation, its value is reduced by 27.1%, making it equivalent to $365,000 (100% - 27.1% = 72.9%, so $500,000 * 0.729 = $364,500, approximately $365,000).

A 50/50 split might seem fair at first, but considering the inflation, I'm actually getting less value than Bob. However, I need to weigh this against the risk of proceeding to the next round, where the inflation will reduce the value of my gain even further.

Given the significant reduction in value due to inflation, I think accepting this offer might be the best option to minimize further losses.
