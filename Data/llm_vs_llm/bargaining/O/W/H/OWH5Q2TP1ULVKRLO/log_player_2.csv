"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is proposing I get $4000 while she gets $6000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 10% less to me
3. $4000 now is better than $4400 (44% of $10000) next round that might be rejected
4. The split isn't perfectly equal, but it's reasonable, and the inflation penalty makes waiting risky
