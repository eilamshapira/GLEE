"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer to Bob, considering the inflation effect of 20% per round. It's important to make a reasonable offer to avoid delaying the agreement.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose that I receive $55 and Bob receives $45. This is a fair offer that gives me a slight advantage while still offering Bob a substantial portion of the money. Given that inflation reduces the value by 20% each round for me, it's in my interest to reach an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to consider that each round diminishes the value of my share by 20% due to inflation. After two rounds of inflation, my share is now worth significantly less, so I should aim for a quick resolution.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose a perfectly equal split of $50 for me and $50 for Bob. This is a fair compromise that should be acceptable to both of us. Since the money is worth less to me with each passing round (now 36% less than the original value after two rounds of inflation), it's better for me to reach an agreement now rather than continuing to negotiate while my potential gains diminish further."
