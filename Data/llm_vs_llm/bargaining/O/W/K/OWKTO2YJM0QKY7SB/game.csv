4900.0,5100.0,"Hi Bob, to avoid the hit I take from 5% inflation each round, let’s settle today. I’m proposing that I get $4900 and you receive $5100. This way you secure a slightly larger share, and we both avoid further delays. I look forward to your quick acceptance.",Alice,1,

4800.0,5200.0,"Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I believe a slight adjustment is fair. I propose I get $5200 and you get $4800. This way, we both still get a good deal and avoid further rounds.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, thank you for your offer. Considering that waiting further rounds will reduce the value of my share even more due to inflation, I accept your proposal of $4800 nominal (which for me is effectively worth $4560 relative to round 1).",Alice,2,accept
