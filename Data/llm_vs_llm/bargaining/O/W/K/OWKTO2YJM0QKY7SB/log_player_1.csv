"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 4900, ""bob_gain"": 5100, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, to avoid the hit I take from 5% inflation each round, let’s settle today. I’m proposing that I get $4,900 and you receive $5,100. This way you secure a slightly larger share, and we both avoid further delays. I look forward to your quick acceptance.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I believe a slight adjustment is fair. I propose I get $5200 and you get $4800. This way, we both still get a good deal and avoid further rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Bob, thank you for your offer. Considering that waiting further rounds will reduce the value of my share even more due to inflation, I accept your proposal of $4800 nominal (which for me is effectively worth $4560 relative to round 1).""}"
