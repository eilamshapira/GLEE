Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to avoid the hit I take from 5% inflation each round, let’s settle today. I’m proposing that I get $4900 and you receive $5100. This way you secure a slightly larger share, and we both avoid further delays. I look forward to your quick acceptance. 
# Bob gain: 5100 
# Alice gain: 4900
