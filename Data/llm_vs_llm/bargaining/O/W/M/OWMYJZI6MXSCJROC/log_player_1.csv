I'm aiming slightly higher than Bob's offer in the previous round, considering the inflation will further decrease the value of the money if he rejects."

This is getting dangerously close to a 50/50 split after another round of inflation, and I'd rather take a less optimal but still reasonable offer than risk getting even less."
