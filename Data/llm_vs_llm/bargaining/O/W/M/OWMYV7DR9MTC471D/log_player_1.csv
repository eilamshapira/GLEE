"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I'm Alice, and I need to propose a split of $10,000, keeping in mind the increasing impact of inflation on both of us. I want to get a good deal for myself, but I also need to make it attractive enough for Bob to accept.

Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

My reasoning: I'm starting with a slight advantage, proposing to take $6,000 while offering Bob $4,000. This seems reasonable at the beginning given that Alice is making the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob has rejected my initial offer and now it's my turn to decide whether to accept his offer in round 2. Taking into account the inflation, for me 1$ is worth 10% less than the initial round, and for Bob 1$ is worth 5% less than the initial round.

Bob's offer is an even split of $5,000 each. Let's consider the current value for me:
$5000 * (1 - 0.10) = $4500

I think this is a reasonable offer, considering the inflation. It is probably better to accept the deal now than to risk further inflation and potential rejection of future offers.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
