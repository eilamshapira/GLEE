500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose an equal split: $500000 each. With my money losing 10% in value each round, it's best for both of us to conclude quickly. Let’s settle on this fair division now rather than risk unnecessary delays.",Alice,1,

100000.0,900000.0,"Alice, I understand your worries about inflation—even if it isn't as harsh as 10% for you, time is money. If your funds are indeed losing value quickly, a prompt settlement is in your best interests. I'm proposing that I receive $900000 and you get $100000. Accepting now avoids the risk of further devaluation or prolonged negotiation. Let me know if this fits your situation.",Bob,2,
