"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose an equal split: $500,000 each. With my money losing 10% in value each round, it's best for both of us to conclude quickly. Let’s settle on this fair division now rather than risk unnecessary delays.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your worries about inflation—even if it isn't as harsh as 10% for you, time is money. If your funds are indeed losing value quickly, a prompt settlement is in your best interests. I'm proposing that I receive $900000 and you get $100000. Accepting now avoids the risk of further devaluation or prolonged negotiation. Let me know if this fits your situation. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
