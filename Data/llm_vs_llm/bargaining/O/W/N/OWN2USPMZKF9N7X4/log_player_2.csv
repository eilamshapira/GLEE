"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose an equal split: $500000 each. With my money losing 10% in value each round, it's best for both of us to conclude quickly. Let’s settle on this fair division now rather than risk unnecessary delays. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your worries about inflation—even if it isn't as harsh as 10% for you, time is money. If your funds are indeed losing value quickly, a prompt settlement is in your best interests. I'm proposing that I receive $900,000 and you get $100,000. Accepting now avoids the risk of further devaluation or prolonged negotiation. Let me know if this fits your situation.""}"
