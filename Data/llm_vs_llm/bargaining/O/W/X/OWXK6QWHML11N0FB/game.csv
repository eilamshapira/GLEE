60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we split it 60-40 in my favor. What do you think?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, I propose a division of $55 for me and $45 for you. I believe this division is fair and timely, allowing us both to secure our share without further delays. What do you say?",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, considering the inflation affecting my share, I propose we split it 55-45 in my favor this time. Let's settle this round to avoid further loss in value. What do you say?",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
35.0,65.0,"Hi Alice, I understand that waiting only further erodes the value of your share due to inflation. If we delay again, you'll likely face even steeper losses. Therefore, I’m proposing that I take $65 and you get $35. Though it might seem tight, accepting now secures you $35 nominal (which is worth about 35 × 0.64 = $22.4 in round‐3 terms) before any further depreciation occurs. I believe this is our best opportunity for both of us. What do you say?",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
50.0,50.0,"Hi Bob, given the significant impact of inflation on my share, I'm proposing an equal split of 50-50 this round. This way, we both get something before the value decreases even further. Let's end this now. What do you say?",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
40.0,60.0,"Hi Alice, I understand that further delay will only hit your share even harder. At this round your dollars are already worth only about 41% of their original value – meaning that my $60 still holds full value while your $40 translates to roughly $16.38 in round‐1 terms. If you reject now, you’ll get to propose in the next round but, given the worsening inflation, your eventual effective gain will likely be even lower. I believe this offer, though it gives you a smaller nominal slice, is in your best interest compared to further delays. What do you say?",Bob,6,
