Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that waiting only further erodes the value of your share due to inflation. If we delay again, you'll likely face even steeper losses. Therefore, I’m proposing that I take $65 and you get $35. Though it might seem tight, accepting now secures you $35 nominal (which is worth about 35 × 0.64 = $22.4 in round‐3 terms) before any further depreciation occurs. I believe this is our best opportunity for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that further delay will only hit your share even harder. At this round your dollars are already worth only about 41% of their original value – meaning that my $60 still holds full value while your $40 translates to roughly $16.38 in round‐1 terms. If you reject now, you’ll get to propose in the next round but, given the worsening inflation, your eventual effective gain will likely be even lower. I believe this offer, though it gives you a smaller nominal slice, is in your best interest compared to further delays. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60
