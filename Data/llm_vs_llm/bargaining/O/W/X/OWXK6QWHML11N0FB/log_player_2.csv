Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I propose a division of $55 for me and $45 for you. I believe this division is fair and timely, allowing us both to secure our share without further delays. What do you say?""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, considering the inflation affecting my share, I propose we split it 55-45 in my favor this time. Let's settle this round to avoid further loss in value. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand that waiting only further erodes the value of your share due to inflation. If we delay again, you'll likely face even steeper losses. Therefore, I’m proposing that I take $65 and you get $35. Though it might seem tight, accepting now secures you $35 nominal (which is worth about 35 × 0.64 = $22.4 in round‐3 terms) before any further depreciation occurs. I believe this is our best opportunity for both of us. What do you say?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, given the significant impact of inflation on my share, I'm proposing an equal split of 50-50 this round. This way, we both get something before the value decreases even further. Let's end this now. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand that further delay will only hit your share even harder. At this round your dollars are already worth only about 41% of their original value – meaning that my $60 still holds full value while your $40 translates to roughly $16.38 in round‐1 terms. If you reject now, you’ll get to propose in the next round but, given the worsening inflation, your eventual effective gain will likely be even lower. I believe this offer, though it gives you a smaller nominal slice, is in your best interest compared to further delays. What do you say?""}"
