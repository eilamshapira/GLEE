"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. 
Alice is offering me $45 while taking $55 for herself. While this isn't an equal split, it's fairly close to 50-50. If I reject, we move to the next round where I can make an offer, but the total amount will be worth 10% less (only $90 total). Even if I then propose a more favorable split for myself, Alice might reject it, leading to further devaluation.

$45 right now is better than potentially getting a larger share of a smaller pot later.
