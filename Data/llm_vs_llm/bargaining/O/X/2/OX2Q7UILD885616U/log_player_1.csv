"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 8333, ""bob_gain"": 1667, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, given that waiting further will cost you more—your share loses 20% per round while mine only drops by 5%—I’m offering you $1,667 now and keeping $8,333 for myself. This split reflects the fair equilibrium given our respective discount factors. Accept this offer and let’s both avoid unnecessary devaluation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the rapid devaluation on my side, I'm proposing a split of $3000 for me and $7000 for you. This offer is more generous to you than your last one to me, and it's still a good deal before the value drops further for both of us. Let's settle this round. 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for the offer. However, if I reject this proposal, I will have the chance to propose in the next round. Given how the inflation reduces the amounts—only 5% for me while it’s 20% for you—I expect to structure a proposal that will yield me a higher effective payoff than 0.95 × $7,000 = $6,650. I believe it’s in both our interests to wait for a fairer split in light of our respective discount rates. I must, therefore, reject your offer.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 8333, ""bob_gain"": 1667, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, in this round the stakes are even higher because of the discounting—my share is now multiplied by 0.9025 and yours by 0.64. If you reject and wait until round 4 where you'll propose, your money will be worth only 0.512 per dollar, which means you can at best expect an effective payoff of roughly $1,067. With my current offer, you'll receive $1,667 nominally (worth about $1,067 effectively), matching your continuation value. Thus, I’m offering you $1,667 and keeping $8,333. I believe this is a fair deal given our respective discounting, so let’s settle now before further value is lost.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, with the value of money dropping significantly for me, I'm proposing $2500 for myself and $7500 for you. This is a fair compromise considering the rapid devaluation I'm facing. Let's end this now before the value drops even more. 
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, by rejecting this offer, I can propose a division in the next round that will yield me a better effective outcome. Under the current discounting, your $2,500 at 48.8% value translates to roughly $1,280 in effective value for you, while my $7,500 becomes about $6,430. If I wait until round 5—when I get to propose—the equilibrium outcome (given our respective discount rates of 5% for me and 20% for you per round) would deliver me roughly $8,333 nominal (worth about $6,787 effectively) and leave you with around $1,667 nominal (worth about $683 effectively). Since my continuation value is higher than the present offer, I must reject your proposal.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 8333, ""bob_gain"": 1667, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, it's my turn to propose. Keeping in mind our per‐round discount factors (for me 0.95 and for you 0.8), the canonical alternating‐offers solution tells us that when I'm making an offer, an equilibrium split is for me to claim 83.33% of the nominal $10,000 and leave you 16.67%. That is, I propose to take $8,333 and give you $1,667. In effective terms at Round 5, my share is worth about 0.95⁴ ≈ 0.8145 of its nominal value and yours 0.8⁴ ≈ 0.4096—that is, you’d effectively get roughly $1,667 × 0.4096 ≈ $683. If you reject this offer, you’ll get to propose in Round 6, but then your effective discount factor will drop further (to 0.8⁵ ≈ 0.3277), and in equilibrium you would design your proposal to guarantee yourself exactly the same effective value. In short, accepting now secures for you the same payoff you’d get by waiting—no better, and without further devaluation. I believe this is the fair and, indeed, equilibrium offer. Let's settle now before more value is lost.""}"
