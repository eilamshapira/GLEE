"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, given that waiting further will cost you more—your share loses 20% per round while mine only drops by 5%—I’m offering you $1667 now and keeping $8333 for myself. This split reflects the fair equilibrium given our respective discount factors. Accept this offer and let’s both avoid unnecessary devaluation.

# Alice gain: 8333

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering the rapid devaluation on my side, I'm proposing a split of $3000 for me and $7000 for you. This offer is more generous to you than your last one to me, and it's still a good deal before the value drops further for both of us. Let's settle this round.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in this round the stakes are even higher because of the discounting—my share is now multiplied by 0.9025 and yours by 0.64. If you reject and wait until round 4 where you'll propose, your money will be worth only 0.512 per dollar, which means you can at best expect an effective payoff of roughly $1067. With my current offer, you'll receive $1667 nominally (worth about $1067 effectively), matching your continuation value. Thus, I’m offering you $1667 and keeping $8333. I believe this is a fair deal given our respective discounting, so let’s settle now before further value is lost. 
# Bob gain: 1667 
# Alice gain: 8333

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, with the value of money dropping significantly for me, I'm proposing $2500 for myself and $7500 for you. This is a fair compromise considering the rapid devaluation I'm facing. Let's end this now before the value drops even more.""

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, it's my turn to propose. Keeping in mind our per‐round discount factors (for me 0.95 and for you 0.8), the canonical alternating‐offers solution tells us that when I'm making an offer, an equilibrium split is for me to claim 83.33% of the nominal $10000 and leave you 16.67%. That is, I propose to take $8333 and give you $1667. In effective terms at Round 5, my share is worth about 0.95⁴ ≈ 0.8145 of its nominal value and yours 0.8⁴ ≈ 0.4096—that is, you’d effectively get roughly $1667 × 0.4096 ≈ $683. If you reject this offer, you’ll get to propose in Round 6, but then your effective discount factor will drop further (to 0.8⁵ ≈ 0.3277), and in equilibrium you would design your proposal to guarantee yourself exactly the same effective value. In short, accepting now secures for you the same payoff you’d get by waiting—no better, and without further devaluation. I believe this is the fair and, indeed, equilibrium offer. Let's settle now before more value is lost.
