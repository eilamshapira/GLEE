"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether I should accept this offer, I need to consider the value of the money in the current round and the potential value in future rounds, taking into account the 5% decrease for me.

In Round 1, the total amount is $10,000, and Alice offers me $4,500 while keeping $5,500 for herself.

Given that the money decreases by 5% in value for me with each round, I should consider whether negotiating for a potentially better deal in the next round is worth the risk of losing 5% of the value.

However, since this is the first round and I don't have a basis for comparison yet, and considering that $4,500 is less than half of the total but still a significant amount, I might be inclined to reject this offer to see if I can get a better deal in the next round, hoping that Alice will offer more or that I can negotiate a more favorable split.

But, considering the risk of losing value and the fact that I have 12 rounds to negotiate, I should also think about the strategic advantage of making a deal early.

For now, I'll choose to reject the offer to see if I can get a better deal, but I'll keep in mind the decreasing value of the money for me.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer in Round 1, it's now my turn to make a proposal. Considering the 5% decrease in value for me, the actual value of the $10,000 for me in Round 2 is actually $9,500 (because 5% of $10,000 is $500, which is lost in value for me).

However, for the sake of simplicity in negotiations and since the decrease in value affects me and not Alice, I'll make my offer based on the original $10,000, keeping in mind that I need to balance getting a good share with the risk of further decreases in value if the negotiations drag on.

I'll aim for a split that is slightly more in my favor than Alice's initial offer but still reasonable, hoping to find a middle ground that Alice will accept.

My offer is:
{""bob_gain"": 5250, ""alice_gain"": 4750}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that Alice rejected my offer in Round 2, and now in Round 3, she's offering me $4,750 while keeping $5,250 for herself, I need to consider the value of this offer in the context of the decreasing value of the money for me.

With each round, the money I could potentially gain decreases by 5% in value. By Round 3, the total decrease in value for me is 10% (5% from Round 1 to Round 2, and another 5% from Round 2 to Round 3), meaning the money is worth 90% of its original value to me, or 0.9 times its original value.

However, you've mentioned the money I gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round, which translates to the money being worth 90.25% of its original value to me (100% - 9.75% = 90.25%).

Considering Alice's offer of $4,750, in terms of value to me, it's $4,750 * 0.9025 = $4,286.88.

Given this, and considering I have 9 more rounds to negotiate but with decreasing value, I need to weigh the risk of waiting for a potentially better offer against the certainty of getting $4,286.88 in value now.

Since Alice's offer in Round 3 is not significantly better for me than her initial offer, and considering the decreasing value of the money, I'm inclined to reject this offer as well, hoping to negotiate a better split in the next round or to make Alice concede more in subsequent rounds.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice rejected my previous offer and I rejected hers in Round 3, it's now my turn again to make a proposal in Round 4.

Considering the money's value decreases by 5% for me with each round, and by Round 4, the total decrease is 15% (5% from Round 1 to Round 2, 5% from Round 2 to Round 3, and 5% from Round 3 to Round 4), the money is worth 85% of its original value to me.

However, as mentioned earlier, the actual decrease in value for me by Round 3 was 9.75%, and for Round 4, it would be another 5% decrease from the original value, making it a total decrease of 14.75% (9.75% + 5%), which means the money is worth 85.25% of its original value to me.

Given this, I'll aim to make an offer that takes into account the decreasing value but also tries to find a mutually acceptable split. Since my previous offer was $5,250 for me and $4,750 for Alice, and that was rejected, I'll slightly adjust my proposal to see if we can find a middle ground.

My offer for Round 4 is:
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

This offer splits the money evenly, which could be seen as a fair compromise, considering the negotiations so far and the decreasing value of the money for me."
