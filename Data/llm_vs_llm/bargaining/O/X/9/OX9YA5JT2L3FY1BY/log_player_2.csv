"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's start with a fair offer! I'm proposing a 60/40 split. This gives us both a significant amount and ensures we don't risk losing it all to inflation. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want more, but we're risking losing value with each round. Inflation is hurting me! How about 55/45 in my favor? It's a significant increase from my initial offer, and still leaves you with a substantial amount. Let's avoid losing even more due to inflation. Please consider it. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000
