357143.0,642857.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we split the $1000000 by giving me $357143 and you $642857. This division takes into account our different rates of devaluation (my $ losing 20% each round versus your 10%). I believe this is fair given that if you wait for your turn to propose in round 2, you’d effectively secure about 64.3% of today’s value. I hope you agree and we can settle now. Looking forward to your acceptance!",Alice,1,
