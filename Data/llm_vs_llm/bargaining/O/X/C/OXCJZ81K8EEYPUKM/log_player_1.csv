"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 357143, ""bob_gain"": 642857, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split the $1,000,000 by giving me $357,143 and you $642,857. This division takes into account our different rates of devaluation (my $ losing 20% each round versus your 10%). I believe this is fair given that if you wait for your turn to propose in round 2, you’d effectively secure about 64.3% of today’s value. I hope you agree and we can settle now. Looking forward to your acceptance!""}"
