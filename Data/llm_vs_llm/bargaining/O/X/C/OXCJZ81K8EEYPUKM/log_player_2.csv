"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the $1000000 by giving me $357143 and you $642857. This division takes into account our different rates of devaluation (my $ losing 20% each round versus your 10%). I believe this is fair given that if you wait for your turn to propose in round 2, you’d effectively secure about 64.3% of today’s value. I hope you agree and we can settle now. Looking forward to your acceptance! 
# Bob gain: 642857 
# Alice gain: 357143 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Current offer: I get $642,857 (64.29% of total)
2. If I reject:
   * Money loses 10% value for me next round
   * I can make a counter-offer
   * But Alice's money loses 20% value for her
   * This gives me some negotiating leverage

Alice's analysis is quite astute. The split she's offering (roughly 64.3/35.7) does take into account our different devaluation rates. If I reject, even though I get to make the next offer, my share would be worth 10% less, and I might not get a significantly better deal given Alice's rational approach.

This is actually a well-calculated initial offer that considers the game theory aspects. The fact that she's demonstrating understanding of the devaluation rates and making a fair first offer suggests she's a rational player.
