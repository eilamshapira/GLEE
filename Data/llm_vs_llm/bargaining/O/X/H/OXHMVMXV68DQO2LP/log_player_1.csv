"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a division that takes into account the inflation penalties for future rounds. Since Bob faces higher inflation (20% vs my 10%), he has more incentive to accept an early offer.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this split because while it gives me a larger share, it still offers Bob a substantial amount. If Bob rejects this, in the next round the total value will be worth less for both of us, but especially for him. This is a fair offer that recognizes both our positions while encouraging early agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. If I accept this offer:
   * I get $4,500, but it's worth 10% less = $4,050 effective value

2. If I reject and make a new offer in round 3:
   * The entire pot will be worth even less (20% less for Bob, 10% less for me)
   * Any gains in the next round will be diminished by inflation
   * There's no guarantee Bob will accept my next offer

The current offer gives me a reasonable portion of the money, and waiting would only reduce the value further for both of us. While it's less than my initial proposal, it's still a substantial amount, and the inflation penalty makes waiting risky.
