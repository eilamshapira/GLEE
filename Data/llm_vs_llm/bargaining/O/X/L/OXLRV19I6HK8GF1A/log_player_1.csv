"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair initial offer, considering there's room for negotiation and the inflation risk.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable split that gives both of us a good share, while slightly favoring me as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
* If I accept now, I'll get $45, but it's worth 10% less due to inflation, so effectively $40.5
* If I reject and make a counter-offer, any future gains will be worth even less to me due to inflation
* Bob seems to be playing strategically by reversing my initial offer
* We still have many rounds left, but the inflation penalty makes waiting costly for me

Given that the inflation only affects my portion and will get worse each round, I should be more inclined to accept reasonable offers early.
