I'm going for a greedy approach here.  I'll take nearly all the money, knowing that the inflation may impact Bob more than me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 487180 
# Bob gain: 512820 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject. Bob's offer is better for him, but it's still a significant drop from the first round.  I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still keeping the majority. I want to see if he'll accept something closer to my preferred split."
