Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. Since inflation affects you but not me, this actually gives you more value now than waiting another round would. This is a fair deal considering our different inflation rates. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm proposing a 65/35 split. Since inflation affects only you (now at about 27% less value for you) and not me, this offer actually provides you more value than waiting another round. If we continue to the next round, the money will be worth even less to you, making this a time-sensitive opportunity for both of us.

# Bob gain: 650000
