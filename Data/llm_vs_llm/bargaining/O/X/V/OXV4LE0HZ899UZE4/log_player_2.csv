"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share this time, but promise to be more generous in the future. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. 

Alice is proposing that I get $100,000 while she gets $900,000. That's a 10/90 split, which is quite uneven. She mentions being ""more generous in the future,"" but that's not relevant to our current game.

If I reject and we move to the next round, I'll be able to make my own proposal. Also important to note that inflation affects Alice (10% less value per round) but not me (0% less).

This means if we go to round 2, the $1,000,000 will still be worth full value to me, but only 90% of the original value to Alice. This gives me negotiating leverage.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a strategic offer that takes into account the inflation that affects Alice but not me.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. Inflation is hurting us both now, so let's split it evenly. This is the fairest way to go forward. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to analyze this offer carefully.

Alice is offering a 50/50 split, which seems fair on the surface. However, her claim that ""inflation is hurting us both"" is not accurate according to the game rules. Inflation only affects Alice (at 10% per round), while my money retains its full value.

We're now in Round 3, and Alice's money is worth 19% less to her than in Round 1. If I reject and we go to Round 4, the money will be worth even less to her (about 27% less than Round 1), while still retaining full value for me.

This gives me increasing leverage, as time is on my side. I could potentially get a better deal in the next round when I make an offer.
