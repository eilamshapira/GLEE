"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think this through:

1. Current offer: $400,000 for me, $600,000 for Alice
2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make an offer
   * But my money will be worth 10% less
   * Her money will be worth 5% less
   * I'd need to offer something she'd accept
3. $400,000 is a substantial amount, but less than half
4. If I reject, I could try for more, but risk further devaluation

Given that:
* The initial offer is not terrible (40% of total)
* Rejecting means immediate 10% loss in value for my share
* Multiple rejections could lead to significant value erosion
* We have limited rounds
* There's no guarantee Alice would accept a better offer from me
