"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split that accounts for potential future inflation if Bob declines.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split where I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000. This is a reasonable offer that gives both of us a substantial amount while accounting for the 5% inflation risk I face if we move to the next round. I'd rather secure a good deal now than risk losing value to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer gives me less than my initial proposal, and even accounting for inflation (5% reduction for me), I can still make a better offer in the next round. The fact that Bob's money is worth 20% less actually strengthens my position. I'll make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Now that I know Bob's money is deteriorating faster than mine (20% vs 5% per round), I'll adjust my offer to reflect this dynamic.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this split where I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000. Given that Bob's money is losing value much faster than mine (20% vs 5% per round), this offer should be more appealing to Bob than waiting for another round where their share would be worth even less. This is a reasonable offer considering the asymmetric inflation effects we're both facing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer because even with my 14.26% inflation penalty, I can still make a better offer in the next round. Bob's money is experiencing much higher inflation (48.8%), which means their negotiating position is weakening faster than mine. A $450,000 share for me is less favorable than what I can propose next round, especially given the asymmetric inflation rates."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that Bob's money is now severely devalued (48.8% loss) compared to my more modest inflation impact (14.26%), I'll make a stronger offer in my favor.

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

I propose this split where I get $700,000 and Bob gets $300,000. This is actually a reasonable offer considering that Bob's money is losing value much faster than mine. If Bob rejects this and we go to another round, their share will be worth even less due to their higher inflation rate (20% per round vs my 5%). It would be rational for Bob to accept this offer rather than risk further devaluation of their share."
