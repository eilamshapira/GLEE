This is a tough one. I'm losing value fast, but accepting this offer would mean settling for significantly less than half. I'm hoping Alice will start to feel the pressure and offer a more equitable deal soon."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 510000, ""alice_gain"": 490000} 

I'm aiming slightly higher than her last offer, signaling I'm serious about getting a fair deal.  With the inflation working against me, I need to try and close this sooner rather than later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

This is getting frustrating. Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation, but I'm not going to accept a deal where I get significantly less. I need to stay firm, but the pressure is definitely on."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the only fair option, especially given the inflation working against me. It's time for Alice to decide if she wants to cooperate and get a deal done or risk both of us walking away with nothing."
