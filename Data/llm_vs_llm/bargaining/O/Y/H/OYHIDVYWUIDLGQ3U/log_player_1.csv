"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a slightly favorable split for myself since I'm going first, but still fair enough that Bob might accept to avoid inflation losses.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. This is a reasonable split considering we're at the start of the game, and Bob would lose 20% value if he declines and moves to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 20% inflation for me, if I accept:
$4000 * 0.8 = $3200 effective value for me
$6000 * 0.9 = $5400 effective value for Bob

If I reject, the next round will have even more inflation, and I risk getting an even worse deal. While this split favors Bob significantly, the inflation penalty makes waiting costly for me.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While it's not ideal, the inflation effect means I'm better off taking this now rather than risking further devaluation of my share in future rounds."
