"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing an even split of the $1,000,000 - we each get $500,000.

This is a fair offer that gives us equal shares. Since there's no inflation for me (0%), I don't lose value by accepting now. While I could reject and make a counter-offer hoping for more, there's risk in that strategy since we only have 12 rounds total, and if we can't agree, we both get nothing.

Given that it's a fair offer and there's no advantage for me in delaying, I'll accept.
