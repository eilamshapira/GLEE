"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically. Alice is offering me only $20 out of $100, keeping $80 for herself. That's quite unfair. 

If I reject this offer, I can make my own proposal in the next round. However, I need to consider that the total amount will be worth 20% less ($80 total). But even with that reduction, I could propose a more favorable split for myself.

I'll reject this unfair offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Now it's my turn to make an offer, but I need to consider that the money is now worth 80% of the original value (effectively $80).

I'll propose a more balanced split, but slightly in my favor since I'm making the offer. I'll suggest getting 60% for myself and 40% for Alice of the remaining value.

{""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40}

Let me explain my reasoning to Alice: ""I propose a more balanced split that gives both of us a decent amount. This is much fairer than the previous offer."""
