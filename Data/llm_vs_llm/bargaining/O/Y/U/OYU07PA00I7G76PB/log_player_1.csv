"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $55 and you get $45. Given that any delay will cost me due to inflation, I believe this is a fair and efficient split for both of us at the outset. Let's settle quickly and avoid further loss in value!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice. This way, neither of us is shortchanged, and we can both walk away with an equal share before inflation takes its toll. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Bob, I accept your offer. Even though my share is now slightly less valuable due to inflation (effectively 95% of $50, or $47.50), I prefer securing a fair split now rather than risking further devaluation in upcoming rounds. Let's finalize the deal.""}"
