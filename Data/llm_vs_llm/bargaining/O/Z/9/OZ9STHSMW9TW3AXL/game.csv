45.0,55.0,"Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I believe we should adjust the split. Since you face a much higher inflation penalty (20% vs my 5%), it's in your interest to reach an agreement sooner. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. This is fair given our different inflation rates, and it's better for you to accept now than face another round of significant devaluation.",Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"Okay Bob, let's try this again. I think this split is more reasonable considering the inflation, and we should end the game now to avoid further losses. Take it or leave it!",Alice,3,
