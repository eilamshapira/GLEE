Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I believe we should adjust the split. Since you face a much higher inflation penalty (20% vs my 5%), it's in your interest to reach an agreement sooner. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. This is fair given our different inflation rates, and it's better for you to accept now than face another round of significant devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
