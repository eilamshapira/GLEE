"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, 60/40. What do you say, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing I get $40 while she gets $60. 

If I reject this offer, I can make my own proposal next round. However, due to inflation, the money will be worth 5% less to me, meaning the $100 would effectively be worth $95 to me. For Alice, it would be worth 20% less, or $80.

Given the significant inflation penalty Alice faces (20% vs my 5%), I'm in a stronger position if we continue to later rounds. A 60/40 split in her favor isn't optimal for me given these dynamics.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I should propose a split that accounts for our different inflation penalties. Alice faces a much steeper inflation penalty (20% per round) compared to my 5%, which gives me leverage to negotiate a more favorable split.

{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I believe we should adjust the split. Since you face a much higher inflation penalty (20% vs my 5%), it's in your interest to reach an agreement sooner. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. This is fair given our different inflation rates, and it's better for you to accept now than face another round of significant devaluation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's try this again. I think this split is more reasonable considering the inflation, and we should end the game now to avoid further losses. Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's new offer considering the inflation effects.

In this round:
- Alice is offering me $45, which due to inflation is now worth about $40.61 to me (9.75% less than original value)
- Alice would get $55, which is worth about $35.20 to her (36% less than original value)

If I reject and we go to round 4:
- The money will be worth 14.75% less to me (another 5%)
- The money will be worth 48.8% less to Alice (another 20%)

Since Alice is facing much steeper inflation penalties, she made a more reasonable offer giving me $45. The inflation is significantly eroding her value, so this is likely close to the best offer I'll get.
