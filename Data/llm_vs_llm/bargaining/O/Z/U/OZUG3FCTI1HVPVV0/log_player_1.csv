"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to propose a division of $1,000,000 between myself (Alice) and Bob. Since I face a 10% depreciation per round while Bob doesn't, I should aim for a fair but strategic first offer.

Given the asymmetric inflation penalty, I should propose a division that's attractive enough for Bob to accept rather than waiting for future rounds where my bargaining position weakens.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering Bob a substantial portion ($450,000) while keeping a slightly larger share for myself, as I face a time disadvantage in this negotiation. This is a fair initial offer that acknowledges we both deserve a significant portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate whether to accept Bob's offer or move to another round where I can make a counter-offer.

If I accept Bob's offer now:
- I receive $400,000 at 90% value = $360,000 effective value
- Bob receives $600,000 at 100% value

If I reject and propose in the next round:
- The money will be worth 80% of original value to me
- Even if I proposed a more favorable split, Bob might reject again
- Each additional round decreases my bargaining power due to the 10% inflation penalty

Since Bob is offering me a substantial portion that still gives me significant value even after the 10% reduction, and rejecting would weaken my position further, I should accept this offer.
