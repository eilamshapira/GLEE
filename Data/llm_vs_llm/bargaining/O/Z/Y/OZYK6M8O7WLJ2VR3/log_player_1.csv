"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your initial offer was a good starting point, but to make it fair for both of us, I propose a 55/45 split in your favor. This considers the inflation disadvantage you face. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
