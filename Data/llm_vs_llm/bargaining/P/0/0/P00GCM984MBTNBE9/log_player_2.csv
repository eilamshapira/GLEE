"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider this offer from Alice. She's proposing an even 50-50 split, where we each get $5,000. This is a perfectly fair division of the money.

Since we have 12 rounds total and there's no inflation for me (meaning the money's value doesn't decrease over time for me), there's no strong reason to reject a fair offer like this. While I could counter-offer to try getting more, there's also risk in continuing the negotiation.
