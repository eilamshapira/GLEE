"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, the $5000 I would gain is actually worth $5000 * 0.9 = $4500 to me.

Considering this, I think the offer is reasonable.
