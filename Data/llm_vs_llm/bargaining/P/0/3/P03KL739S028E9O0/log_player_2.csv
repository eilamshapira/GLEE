"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, considering the inflation, I need to adjust my offer. Since I rejected Alice's offer, the value of the money is now different for both of us.

For me (Bob), the $10,000 is now worth 20% less. So, the effective value is $10,000 * (1 - 0.20) = $8,000.
For Alice, the $10,000 is worth 10% less, making the effective value $10,000 * (1 - 0.10) = $9,000.

I need to aim for a more favorable split to compensate for the reduced value. I'll propose a division where I get a larger share relative to the initial $10,000 amount, aiming for a reasonable split considering the inflation and the starting amount.

Here is my offer:

```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""alice_gain"": 5000
}
