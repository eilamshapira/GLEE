"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, 50-50 split. What do you say, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice offers a 50-50 split ($50 each)
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the money will be worth 5% less to me
3. $50 now is better than trying to get more later with the 5% penalty
4. The offer is fair and reasonable
