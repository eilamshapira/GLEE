"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $600,000 and giving Bob $400,000, with a message suggesting that this is a fair starting point. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's do 55/45. Inflation is hitting me hard, and this is a fairer split considering. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $450,000 I'd gain is actually worth $450,000 * 0.9 = $405,000 to me.

As for Bob's offer, I think it's a bit too generous towards him, especially since the money he gains is worth 20% less to him.

My response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I reject Bob's offer, hoping to negotiate a better split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 10% less than in Round 2, which means it's worth 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 of its original value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering inflation's impact on both of us.""
}
```

I'm offering a split of $520,000 for me and $480,000 for Bob. The message suggests finding a middle ground, taking into account the effects of inflation on both our parts. Let's see how Bob responds!"
