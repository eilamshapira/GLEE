"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split since this is the first round, but considering the 20% inflation penalty for each round if my offer is rejected, I'll aim for a slightly higher portion.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this 60-40 split as a reasonable starting point, giving me a slight advantage while still offering Bob a substantial sum. If Bob rejects this, the total value will decrease by 20% in the next round, making it potentially less beneficial for both of us to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Due to inflation, the $500,000 offered to me is now worth only $400,000 in round 1 terms (20% less)
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 3, any amount I get will be worth another 20% less
3. Bob's offering a 50-50 split, which is fair in nominal terms
4. If I reject, I risk getting even less value in the next round due to inflation

Given that inflation is significantly impacting my gains and further delays will only reduce my effective earnings more, I should accept this offer. While it's less than my initial proposal, it's better than risking further devaluation.
