550000.0,450000.0,I propose a 55-45 split considering our different inflation rates. This is fair since my money loses value faster than yours.,Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,I propose a 60-40 split. You're losing value faster. Let's make a deal.,Bob,2,

525000.0,475000.0,Let's be reasonable. Each round costs me 10% and you 5%. A 52.5-47.5 split is fair and we both lose by delaying. Let's make this deal now.,Alice,3,
