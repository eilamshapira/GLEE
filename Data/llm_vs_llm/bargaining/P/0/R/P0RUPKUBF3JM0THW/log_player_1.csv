Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll propose a fair split that accounts for the different inflation rates we face. Since my money loses value faster (10% vs 5% per round), I should get a slightly higher portion to make it fair.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60-40 split. You're losing value faster. Let's make a deal. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The deal isn't favorable enough given the inflation rates. While Bob acknowledges I'm losing value faster, their proposed split actually gives them more money despite having less urgency to make a deal. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 525000,
""bob_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. Each round costs me 10% and you 5%. A 52.5-47.5 split is fair and we both lose by delaying. Let's make this deal now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering inflation, my offer is 57-43. You're losing value faster than I am. This is more beneficial for both of us than delaying any further. 
# Alice gain: 430000 
# Bob gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. Bob has moved from their initial 60-40 split to a more reasonable 57-43, and with the mounting inflation effects (I've already lost 27.1% of value), further negotiation rounds would likely result in worse outcomes for both of us. The offered $430,000 now is worth more than potentially getting a higher nominal amount in later rounds."
