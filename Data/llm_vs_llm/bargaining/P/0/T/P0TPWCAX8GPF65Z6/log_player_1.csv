"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me propose a balanced but slightly favorable split for myself, considering potential future inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this division because it's close to fair (55/45 split) while giving me a slight advantage. If Bob rejects it, the next round's money will be worth 20% less to me, so this is a reasonable first offer that should be acceptable to Bob while protecting my interests."
