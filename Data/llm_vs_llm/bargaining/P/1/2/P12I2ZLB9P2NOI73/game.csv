400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, I've rejected your initial offer because the 90-10 split heavily favors you. Consider our inflation rates: you lose 20% per round while I only lose 5%. If we keep negotiating, you stand to lose much more. This 60-40 split is fair considering our different positions. If you reject, your potential gain will decrease significantly in the next round due to your higher inflation rate.",Bob,2,

600000.0,400000.0,"I understand your position about inflation, Bob. But 60-40 still feels too lopsided in your favor. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to take a 60-40 split, with you getting the bigger share this time. This way, we both get a decent amount and we can move on from this. ",Alice,3,
