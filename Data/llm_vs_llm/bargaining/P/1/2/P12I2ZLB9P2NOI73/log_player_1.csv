"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've rejected your initial offer because the 90-10 split heavily favors you. Consider our inflation rates: you lose 20% per round while I only lose 5%. If we keep negotiating, you stand to lose much more. This 60-40 split is fair considering our different positions. If you reject, your potential gain will decrease significantly in the next round due to your higher inflation rate. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
