"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair - I'll take the lion's share, but I'm giving you a decent chunk.  Accept and we can both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. Alice is offering me $100,000 out of the $1,000,000, which means she would get $900,000. That's a 90-10 split in her favor.

I need to consider the inflation factors:
- For me (Bob), money loses 5% value each round
- For Alice, money loses 20% value each round

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, my $100,000 would only be worth $95,000 to me due to 5% inflation. But for Alice, her $900,000 would only be worth $720,000 due to 20% inflation.

This gives me significant leverage in the next round. Alice has much more to lose from delays than I do. I should reject this offer and propose a more favorable split in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given the inflation factors, I have strong leverage in this negotiation. Alice faces 20% depreciation per round while I only face 5%. This means delay is much more costly to her than to me. I'll propose a more balanced split that recognizes this difference in time pressure.

""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, I've rejected your initial offer because the 90-10 split heavily favors you. Consider our inflation rates: you lose 20% per round while I only lose 5%. If we keep negotiating, you stand to lose much more. This 60-40 split is fair considering our different positions. If you reject, your potential gain will decrease significantly in the next round due to your higher inflation rate.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position about inflation, Bob. But 60-40 still feels too lopsided in your favor. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to take a 60-40 split, with you getting the bigger share this time. This way, we both get a decent amount and we can move on from this.  
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me carefully evaluate Alice's new offer.

Alice is now offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000, which is a 40-60 split in her favor. This is a significant improvement from her initial 10-90 offer.

Considering the current inflation:
- For me (Bob), money is worth 9.75% less than round 1
- For Alice, money is worth 36% less than round 1

If I accept this offer now, my $400,000 would be worth about $361,000 in round 1 terms.

If I reject and we go to round 4:
- My inflation would increase to about 14.3% (another 5%)
- Alice's inflation would increase to about 48.8% (another 20%)

Alice has clearly moved significantly from her first position, recognizing the inflation pressure. While I could push for more, there's a risk of prolonging negotiations where we both lose value. This offer gives me 40% of the total, which is substantial.

Given the asymmetric inflation rates and the fair movement from Alice, I'll accept this offer.
