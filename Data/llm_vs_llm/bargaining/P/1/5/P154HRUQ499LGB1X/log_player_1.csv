"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to be strategic here. Since I'm affected by inflation more severely (20% per round versus Bob's 10%), I should aim for an early agreement. However, I'm also making the first offer, which gives me some advantage. I'll propose a fair but slightly favorable split to encourage acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This is fair considering I'll lose value faster in future rounds, and it's reasonable enough that Bob should seriously consider accepting rather than continuing to another round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The offer is too favorable to Bob, and we're still early in the negotiation. Even with inflation, I have a better chance by continuing to negotiate and making a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to account for the increasing inflation pressure while still securing a fair share. Since we're now in round 3, my money is worth 40% less than round 1, while Bob's is only worth 20% less.

{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000}

I'm proposing a slightly more balanced split than my first offer. This gives Bob a bit more while still being favorable to me. Given the inflation differences, this is reasonable, and I hope Bob will recognize that continuing the negotiation further will reduce our collective value significantly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 380000 
# Bob gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob is still pushing for a deal that's too favorable to him. Even with the increasing inflation pressure, this offer is not fair enough given that both of us are losing value. I'll continue to the next round to make a more reasonable counter-offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The inflation pressure is mounting significantly - my money is now worth almost 60% less than in round 1, while Bob's is only about 34% less. I need to make a more compelling offer to reach an agreement soon.

{""alice_gain"": 490000, ""bob_gain"": 510000}

I'm now proposing that Bob gets slightly more than me (51/49 split). This acknowledges the inflation reality we both face and shows my willingness to compromise. With my faster inflation rate, continuing much longer would be detrimental to my interests, so I hope Bob recognizes this as a fair offer that's better for both of us than further delays."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Despite the significant inflation pressure, Bob's offer is still too lopsided in his favor. While I'm losing value faster, this doesn't justify such an uneven split. I'll continue to the next round and make a more balanced counter-offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The inflation situation is becoming critical for me. My money is now worth about 74% less than in round 1, while Bob's is worth about 47% less. I need to make a compelling offer to end this negotiation.

{""alice_gain"": 470000, ""bob_gain"": 530000}

I'm offering Bob a 53/47 split in his favor. This acknowledges our inflation differential and shows I'm willing to accept less than half to reach an agreement. Given how much value I'm losing with each passing round, this is a reasonable compromise that should be attractive to both of us rather than continuing this negotiation further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 320000 
# Bob gain: 680000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Even with the severe inflation pressure I'm facing, Bob's offer is still too unbalanced. He's asking for 68% of the money, which doesn't fairly account for our inflation differential. I'll make one more attempt at a fair compromise in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With inflation severely impacting my potential gains (now worth over 83% less than round 1), I need to make a realistic offer that acknowledges my weaker position while still being somewhat fair.

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}

I'm offering a 55/45 split in Bob's favor. This is a significant concession from my initial position and reflects our different inflation rates. At this point, reaching an agreement is critical for me since my money is losing value so rapidly. This offer should be attractive enough for Bob while still giving me a reasonable share."
