Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle of my first offer and even split 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

While not ideal, accepting this offer guarantees me more than I would get with an even split after another rejection. Alice is likely feeling the pressure of the inflation and willing to concede a bit more.  It's better to secure a reasonable gain now than risk getting a worse offer later."
