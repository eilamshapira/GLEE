Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"":6000,""bob_gain"":4000,""message"":""Hi Bob, let's start with a fair division. I propose you take 4,000$ and I'll take 6,000$. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, if you reject this offer, you'll be in the position to propose in round 3, but as the backward induction analysis shows, you'll end up with nothing. To avoid unnecessary delays, I propose that I take the entire $10000 and you receive $0. I hope you understand the rational basis for this offer. 
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 10000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
