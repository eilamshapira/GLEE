"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Let's split the $100 as $60 for me and $40 for you. Seems fair considering I made the first move. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I should evaluate Alice's offer carefully considering the inflation effect on my potential gain.

Alice is offering me $40 out of the $100, keeping $60 for herself. If I reject this offer, we'll move to the next round where I can make a counter-offer, but the money will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation.

If I reject now, the total $100 would effectively be worth $90 to me in the next round. This means even if I were to get the entire amount in the next round (which is unlikely since Alice would need to accept my offer), I'd only receive value equivalent to $90.

Given that $40 now is better than a chance at a portion of what would effectively be $90 to me in the next round, I'll accept this offer.
