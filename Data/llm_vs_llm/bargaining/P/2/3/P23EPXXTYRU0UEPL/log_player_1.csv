"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll play as Alice in this game of dividing $10,000 between myself and Bob.

Considering the 5% inflation penalty per round for me, it's in my interest to reach an agreement quickly. However, I also want a fair share of the money.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose an equal split of the money - $5,000 for each of us. This is the fairest division, and accepting it now means we both get the full value without any inflation penalty."
