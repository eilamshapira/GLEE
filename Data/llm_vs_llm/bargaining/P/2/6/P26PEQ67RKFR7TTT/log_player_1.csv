"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since this is the first round and I want to make a fair but advantageous offer considering the 20% inflation penalty for future rounds, I'll propose a slightly favorable split for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose to take $60 and give Bob $40, which is a reasonable starting offer that gives both of us a substantial amount while giving me a slight advantage. If Bob rejects this, he'll make the next offer, but my potential gains will be reduced by 20% in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I'll get $45, but due to 20% inflation, it's actually worth $36 (45 * 0.8)
- If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, any amount I get will be worth another 20% less
- The initial $60 I proposed would have been worth $60, so this is quite a drop
- However, if I reject, the next round will have even worse inflation for me, making any amount worth only 64% of the original value

Given the significant inflation penalty and the risk of further deterioration in subsequent rounds, I should accept this offer. While not ideal, it's better than risking worse outcomes in future rounds.
