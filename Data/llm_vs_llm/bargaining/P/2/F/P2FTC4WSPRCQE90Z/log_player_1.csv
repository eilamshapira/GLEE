"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair offer to ensure we both benefit from this division.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I suggest we split the money equally. This is a fair division that gives both of us the same amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll adjust my offer considering the inflation effect.

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}

Since we're now in round 3 and I've experienced a 5% inflation penalty already, I'm offering a slightly adjusted split that accounts for this reduction in value. This is a reasonable compromise that still gives both of us a substantial portion while acknowledging the inflation impact on my end."
