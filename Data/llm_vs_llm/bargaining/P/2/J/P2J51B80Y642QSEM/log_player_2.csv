"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
- Alice proposes a 50-50 split
- If I reject, the next round will have 5% inflation for me
- My $5000 in this round would become $4750 in the next round
- A fair split now might be better than trying to negotiate for more with inflation penalties

While I could try to negotiate for more, the inflation penalty makes waiting risky, and a 50-50 split is generally considered fair.
