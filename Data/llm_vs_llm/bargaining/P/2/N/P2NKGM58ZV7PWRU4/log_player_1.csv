Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, by accepting this offer we avoid further devaluation. Waiting to make your own proposal in Round 3 means your future payoff would be based on a smaller pie. I believe this split fairly reflects the advantage of resolving now. Letâ€™s settle quickly and both secure a better outcome. 
# Alice gain: 4875 
# Bob gain: 5125 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
