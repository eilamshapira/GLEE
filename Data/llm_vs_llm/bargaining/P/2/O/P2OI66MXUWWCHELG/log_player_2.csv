"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair is fair. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Since this is the first round, I'll face 5% inflation if I reject and make a counter-offer. $50 now is worth more than $50 (or even slightly more) in the next round. Additionally, a 50-50 split is generally considered fair, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal later.
