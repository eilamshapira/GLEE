"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $400,000 for me
2. If I reject and go to next round:
   * The money will be worth 20% less to me
   * I can make a counter-offer
   * But Alice might reject it, leading to further rounds and more inflation

If I reject, my $400,000 would be worth only $320,000 in the next round. Even if I make a better offer, Alice might reject it, leading to even more losses due to inflation.

While a 40-60 split isn't ideal, the risk of losing value through inflation makes accepting this offer the more prudent choice.
