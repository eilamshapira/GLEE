10.0,90.0,"Hi Bob, here's my proposal for round 1: you get $90 and I get $10. I know it sounds lopsided, but remember that with each round the money loses 10% of its value for you. By accepting now, you secure the full value of that $90 rather than risking a delay that will cost you. I believe this is the best deal for both of us â€“ please let me know if you accept.",Alice,1,
