"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal for round 1: you get $90 and I get $10. I know it sounds lopsided, but remember that with each round the money loses 10% of its value for you. By accepting now, you secure the full value of that $90 rather than risking a delay that will cost you. I believe this is the best deal for both of us â€“ please let me know if you accept. 
# Bob gain: 90 
# Alice gain: 10 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $90, which is a very good share of the total $100
2. She's right about the time pressure - if I reject, in the next round the money will be worth 10% less to me
3. If I reject and make a counter-offer, Alice might reject it, leading to further rounds and more value loss for me
4. $90 right now is better than potentially getting less value in future rounds due to the 10% depreciation
5. This is actually quite a fair and generous first offer from Alice

Given these factors, I should accept this offer. Getting $90 at full value now is better than risking further negotiations where my share would be worth less.
