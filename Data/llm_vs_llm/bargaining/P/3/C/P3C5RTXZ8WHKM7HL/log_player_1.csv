"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor as I'm the first mover, but I'm open to negotiate.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair split. But if you reject it, I'll ask for 60 and give you a 40 on the next round. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. With 5% inflation, if I accept now, my $50 is worth $47.50 in round 1 terms
2. If I reject and we go to round 3:
   - Bob threatens to offer me 40
   - With 10% cumulative inflation, that 40 would be worth only $36 in round 1 terms
   - And that's assuming Bob keeps his word about the 40

Given this analysis, I should accept the current offer. Even though it's less than my initial proposal, it's better than risking a worse outcome in the next round with higher inflation.
