"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair initial offer, considering that inflation will affect future rounds. Since I want to encourage acceptance while maintaining a reasonable share, I'll propose:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'd like to add that this is a fair offer giving you a substantial portion while still being generous enough to Bob to encourage acceptance. If we continue to future rounds, inflation will reduce the real value for me by 10% each time."
