,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, as time passes the pie loses value. Considering that waiting will only diminish our gains, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. I believe this reflects our strategic positions at this stage—please accept this offer so we can both secure a better outcome.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, since you rejected the fair split and proposed an uneven one, I'm adjusting my offer to 55-45 in my favor. Let's not let the value decrease further. What do you think?",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
480000.0,520000.0,"Alice, I understand the past proposals and the pressure of decreasing value as rounds pass. To avoid further erosion of our gains, I propose a quick agreement with a 520-480 split in my favor. This reflects both our interests and the strategic advantage of concluding now. Let's secure the best possible outcome before inflation hits us even harder.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
520000.0,480000.0,"Bob, since we're both feeling the pressure of inflation, I propose a 52-48 split in my favor. It's time we reach an agreement to minimize our losses. What do you say?",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
470000.0,530000.0,"Alice, every round we delay means further loss of value — our dollars are evaporating before our eyes. Since it's my turn to propose, I'm offering a 53-47 split in my favor. This slight edge compensates for my initiating proposal, yet leaves you with a substantial amount. Accepting now ensures that we both walk away with more than if we continued this costly dance. Let's lock in this deal and preserve our gains before inflation takes even more.",Bob,6,

510000.0,490000.0,"Bob, we're losing value fast. I'm proposing a 51-49 split in my favor. It's a small difference, but it's time we agree to stop the bleeding. What do you think?",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, our delay is costing us both. At round 8, every minute we wait the pie shrinks further. I propose a simple 50-50 split to salvage as much value as we can. Accept this fair division now, and we can both stop watching our gains evaporate.",Bob,8,
