"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game and the diminishing value of the money each round. I want to make a reasonable offer that Bob will accept, considering the inflation rates. Since this is the first round, I'll start with a relatively fair split, favoring myself slightly to account for the risk I'm taking by making the first offer.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob rejected my initial offer and now has proposed a split where he gets $5500 and I get $4500.

Considering the inflation, I need to calculate the present value of his offer for me. My money is worth 5% less than in round 1.

*   Round 1 Value of $1: $1
*   Round 2 Value of $1: $0.95

So, $4500 in round 2 is worth $4500 * 0.95 = $4275 in round 1 terms.

Now, I need to decide if $4275 is enough. If I reject, the money will be worth even less next round, and I'll have to make an offer. I think I'll take this offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
