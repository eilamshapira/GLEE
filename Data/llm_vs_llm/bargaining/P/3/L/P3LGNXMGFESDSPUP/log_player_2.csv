"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we both get a good share. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's proposal:

1. The offer is a 50-50 split ($5000 each)
2. This is a completely fair division
3. Since there's no inflation affecting my share, I don't lose value by accepting now
4. While I could try to negotiate for more, there's a risk Alice might make a lower offer in subsequent rounds
5. Getting $5000 now is a guaranteed good outcome

Given these considerations, accepting this fair offer in the first round seems like the most rational choice.
