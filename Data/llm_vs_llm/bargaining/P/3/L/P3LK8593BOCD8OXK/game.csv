5500.0,4500.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we split the $10000 with $5500 for me and $4500 for you. By accepting this offer right away, we both secure a good portion before further rounds see additional inflation (especially for me). Let's make this a fair and quick deal—looking forward to your response!",Alice,1,

5800.0,4200.0,"Hi Alice, I rejected your previous offer because I think we can find a more mutually beneficial split. Considering the inflation, I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share. Let's work together to find a fair deal before the value drops further.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to work together before our funds lose more value. Given the inflation hit—my share being 10% less in value than what it would be in round 1—it's in both our interests to finalize now rather than risk further reduction in value. I'm happy to accept your offer of a $5800 nominal share for me and $4200 for you. Let's seal the deal!",Alice,2,accept
