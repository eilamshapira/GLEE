"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split the $10,000 with $5,500 for me and $4,500 for you. By accepting this offer right away, we both secure a good portion before further rounds see additional inflation (especially for me). Let's make this a fair and quick deal—looking forward to your response!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I rejected your previous offer because I think we can find a more mutually beneficial split. Considering the inflation, I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share. Let's work together to find a fair deal before the value drops further. 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to work together before our funds lose more value. Given the inflation hit—my share being 10% less in value than what it would be in round 1—it's in both our interests to finalize now rather than risk further reduction in value. I'm happy to accept your offer of a $5,800 nominal share for me and $4,200 for you. Let's seal the deal!""}"
