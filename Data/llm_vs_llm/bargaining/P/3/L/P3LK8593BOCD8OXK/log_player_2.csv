"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the $10000 with $5500 for me and $4500 for you. By accepting this offer right away, we both secure a good portion before further rounds see additional inflation (especially for me). Let's make this a fair and quick dealâ€”looking forward to your response! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the actual amount I'm considering is $10,000 * 0.8 = $8,000.

Here's my offer:
{""bob_gain"": 4200,
""alice_gain"": 5800,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I rejected your previous offer because I think we can find a more mutually beneficial split. Considering the inflation, I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share. Let's work together to find a fair deal before the value drops further.""}"
