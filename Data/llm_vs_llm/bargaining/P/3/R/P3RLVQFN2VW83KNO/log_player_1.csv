"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer that accounts for the inflation penalty I face.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor because I face a 20% inflation penalty each round, which you don't have. This is actually fair because if we go to the next round, the money will be worth less to me, so we both benefit by agreeing now.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, since you face a 20% inflation penalty each round, my offer of 5500 for me and 4500 for you is still fair. It's more than what you'd get if we went another round, considering your inflation. Let's settle now. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. If I reject and we go to round 3, the money I receive will be worth another 20% less to me (so 40% less total compared to round 1). 

Bob is offering me $4500, which with the current 20% inflation penalty is equivalent to $3600 in round 1 value. If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 3, even if I asked for the entire $10,000, it would only be worth $6000 to me in round 1 value due to the 40% cumulative inflation.

Given these considerations:
