"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor because I face a 20% inflation penalty each round, which you don't have. This is actually fair because if we go to the next round, the money will be worth less to me, so we both benefit by agreeing now. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Alice, since you face a 20% inflation penalty each round, my offer of 5500 for me and 4500 for you is still fair. It's more than what you'd get if we went another round, considering your inflation. Let's settle now.""
