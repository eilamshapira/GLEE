"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","For the first round, I'll make a reasonable offer. Since the total amount is $1,000,000, I'll propose a split where I get 55% and Bob gets 45%. This seems like a fair starting point, considering we have 12 rounds to negotiate.

Here's my offer in JSON format:
```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
