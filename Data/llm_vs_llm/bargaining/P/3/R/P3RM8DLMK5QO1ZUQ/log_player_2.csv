"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
* Alice is offering me $450,000 out of $1,000,000
* This is a 45-55 split in Alice's favor
* If I reject, the total amount will decrease by 10% to $900,000 for the next round
* However, I'll get to make the next proposal
* While this isn't a 50-50 split, it's fairly close, and the loss from waiting could outweigh any potential gain from negotiating

{""decision"": ""accept""}

The offer is reasonable enough that the risk of losing value through inflation and potentially ending up with nothing after 12 rounds makes accepting this offer the rational choice."
