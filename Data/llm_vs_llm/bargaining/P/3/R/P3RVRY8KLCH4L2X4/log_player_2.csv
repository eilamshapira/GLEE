"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer is a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 10% less to me next round
3. Even if I propose a more favorable split next round (say 60-40), it would be worth less:
   - 60% of 90% = 54% equivalent value
   - Might be better to take 50% now than risk further devaluation

Given that Alice's money devalues more slowly than mine (5% vs 10%), and that a 50-50 split is traditionally considered fair, I should accept this offer. Waiting would likely result in less value for me.
