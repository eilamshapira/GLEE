"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer, keeping in mind the inflation I'm experiencing:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

Explanation: I'm offering Bob $40, and I'm keeping $60. Given the inflation I'm facing, this seems like a reasonable starting point to ensure I get a decent amount before the money loses too much value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Explanation: My money is already worth 10% less, and Bob's offer only gives me $45. That's not enough to compensate for the inflation I'm experiencing. I need to make a counter-offer to try and recoup some of the lost value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, here's my offer for Round 3:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35
}
```

Explanation: My money is now worth 10% less than round 1, so I need to get more to make it worthwhile. I am asking for 65, leaving Bob with 35. This is a bit more aggressive than my first offer but reflects the urgency caused by the inflation affecting me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Explanation: Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation I'm experiencing. Accepting 1$ is basically giving up. Even with the inflation, getting 1$ is worse than getting nothing, as I've already spent time playing this game. I'll try one last offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, this is my final offer. I'm going to try and be reasonable, but I need to account for the substantial inflation I've suffered.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

Explanation: At this point, my money is worth significantly less. I'm asking for $55, which after the inflation hit, is still a gamble. I hope Bob sees this as a fair compromise, considering the circumstances. If he rejects this, I suspect he's just trying to get everything for himself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 46 
# Bob gain: 54 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Explanation: My money is now worth significantly less (40.95% less). While I'd prefer more, $46 is better than nothing. Bob is likely trying to squeeze me dry, but accepting at least gets me *something* for the effort. Continuing to reject will only lead to further losses due to inflation. So, with a heavy heart, I accept."
