"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I want to propose a fair division that accounts for the differential inflation rates. Since Bob's money loses value faster than mine, I should offer him a slightly higher share now to make it more attractive.

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}

I'm offering Bob a bit more than half because the declining value affects him more severely (10% vs my 5%). This is a fair offer that benefits both of us by concluding the deal now rather than going through multiple rounds of negotiation where we both lose value."
