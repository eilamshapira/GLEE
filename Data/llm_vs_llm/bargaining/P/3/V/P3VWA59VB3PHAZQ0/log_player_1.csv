"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. My offer for round 1 is:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the new values due to inflation.

My decision is:

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's my turn to make an offer in round 3. Considering inflation, my money is now worth less.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's calculate the value of the money. My money is now worth 27.1% less than in round 1.

In round 1, my share was $9000. In round 4, $1.00 is worth $0.729 (1 - 0.271).
So, $5500 in this round is worth $5500 * 0.729 = $4009.50 in round 1 value.

Since I am now on the losing side, I will accept the offer to secure some money.
