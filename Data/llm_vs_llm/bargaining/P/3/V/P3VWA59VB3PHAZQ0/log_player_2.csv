"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is proposing that I get $1,000 while she gets $9,000 out of the $10,000 total. This is a 10/90 split, which seems quite uneven. Since I don't face any inflation penalty, there's no rush for me to accept an unfavorable deal. If I reject, I'll be able to make a counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more balanced division that gives both of us a fair share of the money.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an even 50/50 split of the $10,000, which would give each of us $5,000. This is a fair division that recognizes we both deserve an equal share of the available funds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this new offer carefully. Alice is now offering me $3,500 while she would get $6,500. I notice that Alice is facing inflation (her money is worth 19% less than in round 1), but I'm not affected by inflation.

This offer gives me 35% of the total, which is better than the initial 10% offer, but still not an even split. Since we still have many rounds left and I don't face any inflation penalty, I can afford to negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more generous offer to Alice while still ensuring I get a fair share.

{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500}

I'm proposing that I receive $4,500 and Alice receives $5,500 of the $10,000. This gives Alice a slight advantage in the split (55%) while still providing me with a reasonable share (45%). Given that Alice is facing inflation and I'm not, this offer acknowledges her time pressure while still being fair to both of us."
