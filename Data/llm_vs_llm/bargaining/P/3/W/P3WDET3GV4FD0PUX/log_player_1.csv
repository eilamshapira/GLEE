"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split giving you 45% of the money. Since we're facing a 5% inflation with each round, it's in both our interests to come to an agreement quickly. This is a generous first offer that gives us both a substantial amount.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I believe a more even split is in order. Considering the inflation, I'm willing to take a bit more to secure a deal now, but still leaving you with a substantial amount. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
