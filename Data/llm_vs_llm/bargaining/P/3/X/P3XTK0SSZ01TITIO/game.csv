357140.0,642860.0,"Bob, I’m offering 642860 for you and 357140 for me. If you decline, you’ll get to propose next round but the total value will drop (your money by 10% and mine by 20%). Accept now to preserve more value for both of us.",Alice,1,

300000.0,700000.0,"Alice, I'm offering you 300000 and keeping 700000 for myself. This is a fairer split, considering the inflation we both face.  Accept and we can both get a good amount.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, thanks for your offer. Although rejecting would let me propose in the next round, the further inflation would reduce the overall value I could secure. Your offer gives me an immediate effective value (after my 20% depreciation) that’s roughly 300000 × 0.8 = 240000 in round‐1 dollars. In contrast, if I reject and wait to propose in round 3, I’d expect an outcome around 228570 in round‐1 dollars given the harsher depreciation I face. For these reasons, I accept your offer.",Alice,2,accept
