"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 357140, ""bob_gain"": 642860, ""message"": ""Bob, I’m offering 642,860 for you and 357,140 for me. If you decline, you’ll get to propose next round but the total value will drop (your money by 10% and mine by 20%). Accept now to preserve more value for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm offering you 300000 and keeping 700000 for myself. This is a fairer split, considering the inflation we both face.  Accept and we can both get a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. Although rejecting would let me propose in the next round, the further inflation would reduce the overall value I could secure. Your offer gives me an immediate effective value (after my 20% depreciation) that’s roughly 300,000 × 0.8 = 240,000 in round‐1 dollars. In contrast, if I reject and wait to propose in round 3, I’d expect an outcome around 228,570 in round‐1 dollars given the harsher depreciation I face. For these reasons, I accept your offer.""}"
