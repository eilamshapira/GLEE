20.0,80.0,"Hi Bob – here’s my proposal for a swift agreement. Given that every extra round devalues the total (10% for me and 20% for you), waiting is costly. If you reject, you’d gain the upper hand as proposer in round 2 but at a 20% penalty. To avoid that loss, accepting this fair division of $80 for you and $20 for me is optimal for both of us. Let’s settle now and beat inflation together!",Alice,1,

30.0,70.0,"Hi Alice, since we're now in round 2, the value of the money has decreased significantly for both of us, more so for me. My proposal is $70 for me and $30 for you. This is a fair split considering the inflation rates we're facing. Let's end this quickly before the money loses more value!",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob – thanks for your proposal. Considering that rejecting would let me become the proposer in round 3, but inflation would cost me even more value (down to an effective value of about 16.2 dollars if I had to give you your minimum acceptable offer), I’d rather secure the 30 nominal dollars (worth 27 effective dollars) now. So I accept your offer.",Alice,2,accept
