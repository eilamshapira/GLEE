"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 20, ""bob_gain"": 80, ""message"": ""Hi Bob – here’s my proposal for a swift agreement. Given that every extra round devalues the total (10% for me and 20% for you), waiting is costly. If you reject, you’d gain the upper hand as proposer in round 2 but at a 20% penalty. To avoid that loss, accepting this fair division of $80 for you and $20 for me is optimal for both of us. Let’s settle now and beat inflation together!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since we're now in round 2, the value of the money has decreased significantly for both of us, more so for me. My proposal is $70 for me and $30 for you. This is a fair split considering the inflation rates we're facing. Let's end this quickly before the money loses more value! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob – thanks for your proposal. Considering that rejecting would let me become the proposer in round 3, but inflation would cost me even more value (down to an effective value of about 16.2 dollars if I had to give you your minimum acceptable offer), I’d rather secure the 30 nominal dollars (worth 27 effective dollars) now. So I accept your offer.""}"
