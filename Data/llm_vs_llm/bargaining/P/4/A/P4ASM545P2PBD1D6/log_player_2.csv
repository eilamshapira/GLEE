"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob – here’s my proposal for a swift agreement. Given that every extra round devalues the total (10% for me and 20% for you), waiting is costly. If you reject, you’d gain the upper hand as proposer in round 2 but at a 20% penalty. To avoid that loss, accepting this fair division of $80 for you and $20 for me is optimal for both of us. Let’s settle now and beat inflation together! 
# Bob gain: 80 
# Alice gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
