700000.0,300000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a split where I receive $700000 and you receive $300000. I believe agreeing now avoids any potential complications down the road—especially with inflation effects possibly affecting your share. Looking forward to your prompt acceptance.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, I appreciate your opening offer, but I believe a more equitable split is in order. I propose we split the difference a bit more evenly. This ensures a fairer outcome for both of us. What do you think?",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
750000.0,250000.0,"Hi Bob, as we enter Round 3 the clock is ticking—each round only diminishes the real value of the money on your side while my share remains stable. I’m proposing $750000 for me and $250000 for you. I know this split seems less even, but by accepting now you avoid further inflation-related losses on your portion. Let’s settle this deal promptly and avoid additional devaluation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. I'm willing to adjust my previous offer slightly. This ensures we both benefit from a swift resolution.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
850000.0,150000.0,"Hi Bob, as we enter Round 5, every moment that passes further erodes the real value of your share due to inflation—your money is now even more devalued while mine remains fixed. I’m proposing that we settle now: I’ll take $850000 and you’ll get $150000. This deal helps you avoid even deeper losses and allows us both to put an end to prolonged negotiations. Looking forward to your acceptance.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, it seems we're at an impasse. I value a fair outcome, and I'm sure you do too.  Let's settle this with a clean, even split.  50/50. It ensures we both walk away with a reasonable share, regardless of any external factors.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
900000.0,100000.0,"Hey Bob, I know we've both seen how quickly your share is eroding due to inflation. By accepting this offer now—where you'll secure $100000—I guarantee you more real value than if we delay any further. I'm proposing $900000 for myself and $100000 for you. Let's settle this quickly to avoid further losses on your side.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Alice, this is getting us nowhere. I'm making one last attempt at a reasonable compromise.  While I am significantly impacted by the devaluation, I still believe a deal where we both gain something is possible. This is my final offer, let's close this out.",Bob,8,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your final offer. Given that your share faces significant devaluation due to inflation while mine remains unaffected, accepting your offer now makes the most sense. I’m ready to close this deal with the current terms: I get $550000 full value and you get $450000 (albeit at a reduced real value). Let's settle this swiftly and move forward.",Alice,8,accept
