"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","In Round 1, I'll make a fair offer that recognizes our equal positions at the start, while noting that Bob has more pressure from inflation in future rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

Since we both have equal standing in this first round, but Bob faces 5% inflation per round while I face 0%, it's reasonable for me to get a slightly larger share. This offer gives Bob a good portion while accounting for the fact that I have slightly better leverage due to the inflation difference."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer since we both have different inflation rates, which should be factored into a fair division. While Bob's money loses 5% value each round, mine doesn't lose any value. This creates an asymmetry that should be reflected in our split, especially as rounds progress."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

Since we're now in round 3, Bob's money is worth less due to the 5% inflation per round, while mine maintains its value. This difference in our positions should be reflected in the split. Bob has already rejected a 55/45 split, but the longer we negotiate, the more the inflation affects Bob's position. This offer of 60/40 accounts for the changing dynamics while still giving Bob a substantial portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer. This is a reasonable compromise at 55/45, which is what I initially proposed in round 1. At this point, Bob's money has already lost over 14% of its value due to inflation, so it makes sense to conclude the negotiation now with this fair split rather than continuing further rounds where Bob would lose even more value."
