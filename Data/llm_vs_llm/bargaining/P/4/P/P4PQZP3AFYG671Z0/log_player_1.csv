Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"":6000,""bob_gain"":4000,""message"":""Let's start by dividing the $10,000 fairly. I'll take $6000 and you take $4000. I think this is a good starting point.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you wanted a larger share, but considering the inflation rates affecting us both, let's try to be more equal. I'm offering $5100 for me and $4900 for you. This way, we both get a fair share and can end the game early to minimize the effects of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
