Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5100, ""alice_gain"": 4900, ""message"": ""I understand that you wanted a larger share, but considering the inflation rates affecting us both, let's try to be more equal. I'm offering $5100 for me and $4900 for you. This way, we both get a fair share and can end the game early to minimize the effects of inflation.""}"
