500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Bob! I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split, which gives us both $500000. Since there's no inflation affecting me, this is a straightforward and equitable division that benefits us both equally. What do you think?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, I rejected your offer because of inflation! My money loses value each round. To make it worthwhile for me, I propose $600000 for me and $400000 for you. This accounts for the risk I'm taking. Let's get this done!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
480000.0,520000.0,"Bob, I understand your concern about inflation affecting your gains. I'm offering you $520000 which is more than half and accounts for some of the inflation pressure you're facing. This is a fair compromise that considers both our interests. Let's close this deal now rather than letting further inflation impact your share.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"Alice, inflation is eating away at my potential gains! I need $650000 to compensate for the increasing risk and lost value. This is a much better deal for me considering the circumstances. Let's finalize this now.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Bob, I understand inflation is affecting your gains significantly - it's now at 14.26% less value for you. I'm offering you $550000, which more than compensates for this inflation effect. This is a fair adjustment that benefits both of us, and prevents further value loss for you if we continue negotiating. Let's close this deal now.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"Alice, the inflation is really hurting me now! To make this worthwhile, I need $700000. I know it's a big ask, but the time is running out and my money is losing value fast. Consider this my best and final offer.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
420000.0,580000.0,"Bob, I recognize inflation has now reached 22.62% for you, which is substantial. I'm offering you $580000, which gives you significantly more than half and compensates for the inflation effect. At this point, we're both risking getting nothing if we don't reach agreement soon. This is a fair compromise that respects both our interests while acknowledging your inflation challenge.",Alice,7,
