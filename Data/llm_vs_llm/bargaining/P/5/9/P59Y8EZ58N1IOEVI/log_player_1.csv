"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an initial offer that considers the difference in our discount rates. Since inflation affects Bob more severely (20% per round) compared to me (5% per round), I should propose something fair that gives him incentive to accept now rather than delay.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500}

This offer gives Bob a substantial portion while recognizing that waiting is more costly for him than for me. If he refuses, I'll need to recalculate based on the inflation rates for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to reconsider the situation. After two rounds, my inflation penalty is now 10% (5% per round) while Bob's inflation penalty is 40% (20% per round). This means Bob is more pressured to reach an agreement quickly. I'll adjust my offer to account for this.

{""alice_gain"": 5800, 
""bob_gain"": 4200}

This offer gives Bob $4,200, which after his 40% inflation penalty would be worth about $2,520 to him. If he delays further, his position weakens significantly due to his higher inflation rate. This should be a compelling reason for him to accept rather than continue to the next round."
