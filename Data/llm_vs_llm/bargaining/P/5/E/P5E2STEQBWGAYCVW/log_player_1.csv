"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a fairly generous offer to Bob to encourage acceptance, but still maintain a slight advantage for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose: I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. This is a reasonable split that gives both of us a substantial amount, with just a small advantage to me as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

That's too unfair of a split in Bob's favor. I'll make a more balanced counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll adjust my offer to be more balanced while still trying to maintain a fair position.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose a perfectly equal 50-50 split: $5,000 each. This is the fairest possible division and removes any advantage for either side. It's hard to argue against perfect equality."
