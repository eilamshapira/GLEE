"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider this offer. 

Alice wants $5,500 and is offering me $4,500. If I reject and we go to the next round, the money loses 10% of its value for me. So in the next round, the $10,000 would only be worth $9,000 to me.

Since inflation only affects me, Alice has a strategic advantage in later rounds. If I make a counter-offer, Alice might reject it, causing further inflation for me.

Given these circumstances, this first offer is actually reasonable. I get 45% of the pot, and if we delay, my potential maximum share decreases with each round.
