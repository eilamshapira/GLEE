"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, giving you a solid $4000. This is a fair offer considering we both want to avoid inflation eating into our gains. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has offered a 60-40 split where she gets $6,000 and I would get $4,000. Let me consider this offer.

If I reject and we move to the next round, the money will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation, meaning the total effective value would be $9,000 for me. Even if I could get a 50-50 split in the next round ($5,000), that would be worth only $4,500 to me after inflation.

Since $4,000 now is better than a risky chance at getting slightly more in the next round (with inflation reducing its value), I should accept this offer.
