"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, the money will be worth less to me next round
4. $40 now is better than potentially getting $50 next round but with 5% less value ($47.50 effective value)
5. While I could try to negotiate for more, there's risk in prolonging the game
