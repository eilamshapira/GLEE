"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a strategic first offer. Since I'm affected by 10% inflation per round while Bob isn't, I need to secure a good deal early. However, I also need to make it attractive enough for Bob to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which is reasonable considering I have more urgency to make a deal due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this... 

With 10% inflation, the $450,000 offered to me is actually worth $405,000 in round 1 terms. If I reject and we continue to round 3, any amount I get will be worth another 10% less. Plus, there's the risk of continued rejection and further rounds of inflation.

While this isn't as good as my initial offer, the inflation penalty makes it risky to continue negotiating. Bob has the advantage of no inflation pressure, and might offer even less in later rounds knowing my position weakens.
