60.0,40.0,"I suggest a fair 60-40 split. Since the money loses value for me each round but not for you, this is a reasonable offer that benefits us both.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Considering the inflation affects you more, I'm offering a slightly better deal for you than a straight 50-50 split, but still favorable to me since the money retains its value for me.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
65.0,35.0,"Due to the 10% total inflation loss I'll face at this point, I need a larger share to make it worthwhile. This 65-35 split is still reasonable for both of us, as my real value is effectively only around 58.5 after inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
40.0,60.0,"Given the increasing inflation impact on your share, I'm willing to offer you a significant portion, but since the value remains constant for me, I need to secure a larger share to account for the potential further devaluation of your assets.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
70.0,30.0,"With nearly 20% total inflation loss for me at this point, I need a 70-30 split to make it worthwhile. My actual value after inflation would be around 56.7, which is fair. Let's end this now as further delays hurt both of us.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
35.0,65.0,"Considering the significant inflation impact on your share, I'm offering a compromise. However, since the money's value remains unchanged for me, I must prioritize securing a substantial share for myself, given the diminishing value of your potential future offers.",Bob,6,
