"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I suggest a fair 60-40 split. Since the money loses value for me each round but not for you, this is a reasonable offer that benefits us both.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation affects you more, I'm offering a slightly better deal for you than a straight 50-50 split, but still favorable to me since the money retains its value for me. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The 45-55 split is not good enough considering I could have gotten 60-40 in the first round. Even with 5% inflation, I would still get more by proposing a better split in the next round. Let me make another proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Due to the 10% total inflation loss I'll face at this point, I need a larger share to make it worthwhile. This 65-35 split is still reasonable for both of us, as my real value is effectively only around 58.5 after inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the increasing inflation impact on your share, I'm willing to offer you a significant portion, but since the value remains constant for me, I need to secure a larger share to account for the potential further devaluation of your assets. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is an even worse offer than before, giving me only 40%. Even with the 14.26% inflation, I would still get more value by proposing a better split in the next round. Rejecting and making a new proposal is the better choice."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 70,
""bob_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""With nearly 20% total inflation loss for me at this point, I need a 70-30 split to make it worthwhile. My actual value after inflation would be around 56.7, which is fair. Let's end this now as further delays hurt both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the significant inflation impact on your share, I'm offering a compromise. However, since the money's value remains unchanged for me, I must prioritize securing a substantial share for myself, given the diminishing value of your potential future offers. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Although this isn't an ideal split, I'll accept it. At this point, my 35$ would be worth about 27.08$ (after 22.62% inflation), and if I reject, the next round would have even more inflation. If I proposed another split, Bob would likely reject again, and my share would continue to decrease in value. It's better to take this deal now than risk further devaluation."
