# Alice's message: I suggest a fair 60-40 split. Since the money loses value for me each round but not for you, this is a reasonable offer that benefits us both.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Due to the 10% total inflation loss I'll face at this point, I need a larger share to make it worthwhile. This 65-35 split is still reasonable for both of us, as my real value is effectively only around 58.5 after inflation.

""alice_gain"": 40,

# Alice's message: With nearly 20% total inflation loss for me at this point, I need a 70-30 split to make it worthwhile. My actual value after inflation would be around 56.7, which is fair. Let's end this now as further delays hurt both of us.
