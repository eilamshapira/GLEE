"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

The offer is a 40-60 split in Alice's favor. While this isn't an equal split, I need to consider:
1. If I reject, the money will be worth 10% less to me next round
2. I could counter-offer, but Alice would only lose 5% value
3. We have limited rounds, and prolonged negotiation reduces value for both
4. $40 is still a substantial amount

While I could try to negotiate for more, the asymmetric inflation rate puts me at a disadvantage in lengthy negotiations. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush.
