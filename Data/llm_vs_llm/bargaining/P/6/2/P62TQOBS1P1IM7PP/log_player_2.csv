Let's see if Alice can do better in the next round. Since inflation affects me, I might want to aim for more than half of the money."

Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5250 
# Alice gain: 4750 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is higher than her previous offer, but considering the inflation effect on my gains, I would be getting less value than in the first round. Let's see if I can get a better deal in the next round.

I am counting on the fact that Alice's inflation is lower than mine. I am hoping that Alice would accept a deal that is more beneficial for me, than for her."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5900, ""alice_gain"": 4100}

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5750 
# Alice gain: 4250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Although Alice's offer is lower than my previous offer, considering the inflation effect, I would be getting less value if I reject this offer and the game continues to the next rounds. Therefore, it's better to accept this offer and secure my gains.

The value I'm getting from this deal is 3775, while the value for Alice is 3464."
