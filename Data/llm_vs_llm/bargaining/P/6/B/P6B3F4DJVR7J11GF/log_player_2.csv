"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With a 50-50 split, I would get $500,000. However, if I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the money will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation. That means my $500,000 would only be worth $475,000 in the next round.

If I try to negotiate for more, I risk:
1. Further inflation losses in subsequent rounds
2. Alice rejecting my counter-offer
3. Potentially ending up with nothing if we can't agree within 12 rounds

A fair 50-50 split in the first round avoids all these risks and gives me a solid amount. While I could try to negotiate for more, the inflation penalty makes this risky.
