"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a reasonable offer that accounts for the 5% inflation risk I face in future rounds while still being fair to Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this division because it's close to equal while giving me a slight advantage as the first mover. It's a fair offer that Bob should seriously consider, especially since waiting will reduce the real value of the money for me due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount I receive will be worth another 5% less. Right now, my $5000 would be worth $4750 (95% of $5000) due to the first round of inflation.

If I continue to later rounds, the value will keep decreasing for me. While I might be able to negotiate a higher nominal amount, the inflation penalty makes this risky. Also, Bob's offer is perfectly equal in nominal terms, which is fair.

Given these factors, I should accept this offer now rather than risk further value degradation.
