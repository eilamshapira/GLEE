"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's get this done quickly. I'm offering you a fair share to ensure we both walk away with something. Take it! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $1,000 out of $10,000 (just 10%)
2. If I reject, I can make my own offer next round
3. My money will be worth 5% less next round, but I could potentially get much more
4. There are still 11 rounds left
5. This is clearly not a fair share as Alice claims - 90/10 split is very unfavorable

This offer is too low. I should reject and propose a more equitable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a much more equitable split, considering that I'm facing a 5% depreciation per round while Alice isn't:

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer was very unfair. I'm proposing a more balanced split that slightly favors me to account for my time pressure. This is much more reasonable than your 90/10 split.""}"
