"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it evenly, fair for both 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing an even 50/50 split where we each get $5,000. This is objectively fair in terms of pure equality.

However, I need to consider the inflation factor. If I reject this offer and we go to the next round, any amount I receive will be worth 20% less to me. That means if I were to counter-offer and somehow get the full $10,000 in the next round, it would only be worth $8,000 to me due to inflation.

Since $5,000 now is worth more to me than potentially getting a larger nominal amount in future rounds (when accounting for inflation), and the offer is fair on its face, I should accept.
