"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Based on a backwards‐induction analysis of this alternating-offers game (where each round both players “lose” some of the pie’s value—in your case 5% per round that passes, and for Bob 20% per round), an equilibrium proposal in the very first round must give Bob exactly as much (in today’s dollars) as he would “expect” to get by waiting for his turn to propose. (Think of it as “splitting” the surplus: since if Bob rejects your offer now he will eventually secure a smaller—discounted—share, you must offer him at least that much right away.)

A (rough) analysis working backward from Round 12 shows that if the game were to reach later rounds the “threat” payoffs would be as follows. For example (with all divisions expressed in the nominal amounts of dollars):

• In Round 12 Bob is the proposer; he could – if needed – offer Alice 0 and keep $10,000.  
• In Round 11 Alice would then have to give Bob an offer that gives him, in effective terms (after his 20% devaluation for a delay), the same value he would get as proposer in Round 12. That works out to Bob receiving about $8,000 (nominal) in Round 11, with Alice retaining $2,000.  
• Stepping back further through Rounds 10, 9, 8, … and all the way to Round 2, one finds that if Bob were given the chance to propose the equilibrium offer his “equilibrium share” in nominal dollars would be about $4,084.21, leaving Alice about $5,915.79. However, because Bob’s money is worth only 80% per round after a delay, his effective value in Round 2 is 0.8 × 4,084.21 ≈ $3,267.37.

Now in Round 1 you are the proposer, and nothing is discounted yet (for either player). So to leave Bob exactly as well off as if he postponed to Round 2, you need to offer him a nominal $3,267.37 in Round 1. That leaves you with 10,000 – 3,267.37 ≈ $6,732.63.

Thus, a reasonable first‐round JSON proposal is:

{""alice_gain"": 6732.63, ""bob_gain"": 3267.37}

You can present this offer to Bob."

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let's review the situation briefly. Remember that the twist is that as time passes the “pie” gets discounted for each party:
 • Your (Alice’s) dollars lose 5% of their value each round.
 • Bob’s dollars lose 20% of their value each round.
Also, note that all proposals are for the nominal $10,000, but what matters to each player is the “effective value”—the nominal number multiplied by their discount factor for that round. (In round 1 the factors are 1×, in round 2 they are 0.95 for you and 0.80 for Bob, in round 3 they are 0.90 for you and 0.60 for Bob, and so on.)

A little background on how we “backwards‐induce” a fair proposal in these kinds of games:

 1. In round 1, you (Alice) used the following reasoning. If Bob rejects your round‑1 proposal, then in round 2 he becomes the proposer. In round 2 Bob’s “money” is worth only 80% (0.80×) whereas yours is worth 95% (0.95×) of a fresh $10,000. Working backward, one can show that Bob’s best “fallback” (his continuation value) amounts to an effective $3,267.37 in round 1 terms. (That is, although if Bob were to propose in round 2 he could secure a nominal share of about $4,084.21, its effective value for him is 0.80×4,084.21≈$3,267.37.) So your round‑1 offer was to give him $3,267.37 and keep $6,732.63.

Now the play has continued:
 • Bob rejected your round‑1 offer.
 • In round 2 Bob made the “nice‐split” offer (5000/5000), but you rejected it because you can do better by waiting.

We are now in round 3—and you (Alice) are the proposer. At this point the discount factors (relative to the first round) are:
 • For you: 1 – 0.05×2 = 0.90 
 • For Bob: 1 – 0.20×2 = 0.60

So if you and Bob agree in round 3 then a nominal amount “a” for you is worth 0.90×a to you, and a nominal amount “b” for Bob is worth 0.60×b to Bob.

The idea now is that you want to make an offer that leaves Bob exactly as well off as if he were to reject your proposal and then propose in round 4. (That is the “indifference‐principle” often used in bargaining models.)

Let’s determine Bob’s “continuation value” if he rejects round 3 and becomes proposer in round 4. In round 4 the discount factors will be:
 • For Bob: 1 – 0.20×3 = 0.40
 • For you: 1 – 0.05×3 = 0.85

A quick look at the horizon from round 4 onward reveals that time is very short. In fact, if the game reaches round 6 the effective value for Bob would drop to 0 (since
  Round 5 Bob’s factor = 1 – 0.20×4 = 0.20,
  Round 6 Bob’s factor = 1 – 0.20×5 = 0.00).
Thus the “fallback” for Bob in round 4 is very modest.

Let’s work backward from round 5:
 • In round 5 Alice would be proposer. Knowing that if she fails (moving to round 6) Bob would get nothing (his effective factor would be 0), she could offer Bob nothing and claim the entire $10,000 (nominal). In round 5 her effective value would then be 0.80×10,000 = 8,000.
 • Now, in round 4 Bob (as proposer) must give Alice at least what she would get if she rejected his proposal in round 4—that is, an effective 8,000 (which in round 4 means a nominal amount of 8,000 divided by your round‑4 factor 0.85). That nominal amount is 8,000/0.85 ≈ 9,411.76. Since the pie is $10,000 nominal, Bob could then keep 10,000 – 9,411.76 ≈ 588.24 for himself.
  – Bob’s effective payoff in round 4 would be 0.40×588.24 ≈ 235.30.
 • Thus, if Bob rejects in round 3 (and gets to propose in round 4), he can guarantee himself an effective payoff of about 235.30 (in “first‑round dollars”).

Now return to round 3:
 • As proposer in round 3, you want to leave Bob exactly indifferent. Suppose you offer Bob x dollars (nominal) in round 3. Its effective value for him is 0.60×x.
 • To leave him indifferent, set:
  0.60×x = 235.30  
  => x ≈ 235.30 / 0.60 ≈ 392.17 nominal.
 • Then you would keep 10,000 – 392.17 ≈ 9607.83 nominal.
 • Your effective value in round 3 would be 0.90×9607.83 ≈ 8647.05.
 • Bob, by accepting your round‑3 offer, would get 0.60×392.17 ≈ 235.30—exactly what he would expect by waiting to propose in round 4.

Thus, a proposal that makes Bob just indifferent (and leaves you as much as possible) is to offer him about $392.17 (nominal) and keep about $9,607.83 for yourself.
