"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze this offer.

*   **Bob's Gain:** $4000
*   **Alice's Gain:** $6000

Since this is the first round, the money's value hasn't been affected yet by inflation. Therefore, $4000 for Bob is a decent amount, but I'll reject it.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's my turn to make an offer. Remembering the inflation, the money is now worth 20% less for me, meaning $1 is worth $0.80 to me now. I need to factor this into my offer. I want to propose a split that will still leave me with a good amount after the inflation, while being attractive enough for Alice to accept.

I will offer Alice slightly more than she offered me in the previous round.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this.

*   **Bob's Gain:** $3500
*   **Alice's Gain:** $6500
*   **Inflation:** 36%

This means my $3500 is only worth $3500 * (1 - 0.36) = $3500 * 0.64 = $2240 to me.

This is significantly less than the $4000 initially offered, which would have been worth $4000. It's also much less than I proposed for myself in the previous round, accounting for inflation. I will reject.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's my turn again. The inflation is hitting hard. Now, the money I gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. So $1 is worth $0.64 to me now. I need to make a compelling offer.

Since Alice rejected my previous offer and is now offering me even less, she's clearly aiming for a higher share. To account for the inflation and her desires, I need to be strategic. I'll aim for a lower amount for myself, but it needs to be high enough to still be worthwhile after the inflation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alright, let's break this down.

*   **Bob's Gain:** $3000
*   **Alice's Gain:** $7000
*   **Inflation:** 59.04%

This means my $3000 is now only worth $3000 * (1 - 0.5904) = $3000 * 0.4096 = $1228.80.

That is a terrible offer. I'm losing so much value to inflation that accepting such a small amount is almost pointless. I'm going to reject and hope I can get at least a little more in the next round, even if it's still affected by inflation.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, this is getting difficult. The inflation is eating away at my potential gains. The money I gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round, which is $0.4096 for every $1.
I need to make a final, serious offer, knowing that it might be my last chance. I have to assume Alice is going to continue trying to squeeze me. Therefore, I have to make a counter-offer that I am willing to accept if she just returns the same offer next round. To do that, I will make the amount I am willing to accept, knowing that she would likely take it anyway.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, this is a critical decision point.

*   **Bob's Gain:** $2500
*   **Alice's Gain:** $7500
*   **Inflation:** 73.79%

This means my $2500 is now worth only $2500 * (1 - 0.7379) = $2500 * 0.2621 = $655.25.

This is an extremely low amount. However, the inflation is so severe that rejecting this offer and making another proposal would likely result in me getting even less in the next round. Although $655.25 is much lower than what I initially hoped for, it is better than nothing, and it's likely the best I'm going to get at this point.
