"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a split that takes into account that Bob faces a 20% depreciation per round while I don't face any depreciation. This gives me some negotiating leverage, as waiting is more costly for Bob than for me.

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I propose I get $70 and Bob gets $30. This is a reasonable opening offer considering Bob loses 20% value each round if he refuses, while I don't lose any value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. If I accept Bob's offer:
   * I get $55 (worth full value to me)
   * Bob gets $45 (worth 80% of original value = $36 effective value to him)

2. If I reject and make a new offer next round:
   * Bob will face another 20% depreciation
   * I maintain my negotiating advantage as my money keeps its value
   * However, there's no guarantee Bob will accept my next offer

Since $55 is a reasonable amount and represents more than half of the total, and considering that prolonging the negotiation might lead to a less cooperative dynamic, I'll accept this offer.
