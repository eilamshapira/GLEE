"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it evenly, no need to wait 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice proposes a 50-50 split, which is fair
2. If I reject, the total amount will be worth 95$ in the next round
3. Even if I could get a slightly better deal next round, the 5% loss would likely offset any gains
4. This is a reasonable first offer that gives me half of the full value
