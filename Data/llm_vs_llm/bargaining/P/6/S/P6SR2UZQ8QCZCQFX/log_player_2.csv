"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40. This ensures a larger share for me while still giving you a significant amount, Bob.  
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer:
1. Alice wants a 60/40 split in her favor
2. I would get $40, she would get $60
3. If I reject, the next round will have the total worth 20% less (only $80 total)
4. I could counter-offer, but Alice might reject, leading to further devaluation
5. $40 is a reasonable amount, and the risk of getting less through negotiation is significant
