"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer, factoring in the rapidly approaching inflation.

```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000
}
```

My reasoning is that with the threat of inflation, a larger share now is better than a smaller share later. I'm offering Alice a significant portion still, hoping she values a guaranteed $300,000 over risking further inflation and potential loss in later rounds."
