"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous! I think this is a fair split. Let's end it here. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me (Bob) with each passing round, and 10% less for Alice, I'll take that into consideration for my offer.

For Round 2, the value of the money for me is 80% of the original, and for Alice, it's 90% of the original.

Here's my offer:
{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it more evenly, considering the decreasing value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob.  Inflation is hitting us both hard, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $400,000 I would gain is actually worth 64% of the original value (100% - 36% = 64%), which is approximately $640,000 in the original value.

However, since the actual value is decreasing, I should consider the decreasing value for both of us.

For me, $400,000 is worth $400,000 * 0.64 = $256,000 in Round 1 value.
For Alice, $600,000 is worth $600,000 * 0.81 = $486,000 in Round 1 value.

Given the significant decrease in value and the fact that this is Alice's ""final offer"", I should weigh my options carefully.
