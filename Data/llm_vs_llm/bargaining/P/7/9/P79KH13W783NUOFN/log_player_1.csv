"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's aim for a fairer split for Bob in round 2. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the fact that the money I gain is worth 5% less, I calculate my gain as:

350000 * 0.95 = 332500

This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, and Bob's gain is still quite high. I think I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth:

For me: 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025 (5% less each round, for 2 rounds)
For Bob: 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 (20% less each round, for 2 rounds)

I'll make a new offer, taking into account the decreasing value of the money:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation hit""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is hurting us both. Let's settle for a 60/40 split favoring me a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is worth 14.26% less, which means:

400000 * (1 - 0.1426) = 400000 * 0.8574 = 343000 (approximately) for me, if I accept the offer

And for Bob, the money he gains is worth 48.8% less:

600000 * (1 - 0.488) = 600000 * 0.512 = 307200 (approximately) for Bob, if I accept the offer

However, I think I can still negotiate a better deal, considering the significant decrease in value for Bob.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth:

For me: 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.8145 (5% less each round, for 4 rounds)
For Bob: 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.4096 (20% less each round, for 4 rounds)

I'll make a new offer, taking into account the decreasing value of the money:

{""alice_gain"": 580000, 
""bob_gain"": 420000, 
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, I'm offering a better split considering the inflation""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise at 55/45. Time is running out and inflation is killing us! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is worth 22.62% less, which means:

450000 * (1 - 0.2262) = 450000 * 0.7738 = 348150 (approximately) for me, if I accept the offer

And for Bob, the money he gains is worth 67.23% less:

550000 * (1 - 0.6723) = 550000 * 0.3277 = 180235 (approximately) for Bob, if I accept the offer

Given the significant decrease in value for both of us, and considering that time is indeed running out, I think this offer is more reasonable. Bob's gain is heavily impacted by the inflation, so I'm willing to accept this compromise.
