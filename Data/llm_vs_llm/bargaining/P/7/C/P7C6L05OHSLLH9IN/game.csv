6000.0,4000.0,"I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first move, which is fair considering the risk of future devaluation.",Alice,1,

4872.0,5128.0,"Alice, considering the further devaluation in future rounds, I propose a deal that reflects our respective bargaining positions. By accepting now, you secure 4872, which is in line with what you’d expect if you waited, but without risking additional loss from the discount. I believe this is a fair offer for both of us—let’s agree and avoid further devaluation.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, let's be practical. With the 5% devaluation, this split actually gives you 4275$ and me 5225$ in real value. If you reject, the next round will reduce our gains even further. This is a fair compromise - let's end this now.",Alice,3,
,,"Alice, while I appreciate your practical outlook, I believe I can secure a better outcome in the next round despite further devaluation. I am willing to wait for my turn to propose rather than settle for a split that gives me only 4500 nominal dollars (worth roughly 4060 in today’s value).",Bob,3,reject
4880.0,5120.0,"Alice, I understand your desire to maximize our real gains, and further delay only deepens the loss due to devaluation. In round 5 you’d have the proposer’s advantage, but with an extra round of 5% discount, your effective value would be about 4178 (in first‐round dollars). With this offer, you’d secure roughly 4187 in today’s value. I believe this slight premium over your continuation value should be an incentive to settle now and avoid extra loss for both of us.",Bob,4,
