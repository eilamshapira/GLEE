"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the further devaluation in future rounds, I propose a deal that reflects our respective bargaining positions. By accepting now, you secure 4872, which is in line with what you’d expect if you waited, but without risking additional loss from the discount. I believe this is a fair offer for both of us—let’s agree and avoid further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 4872 
# Bob gain: 5128 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

If I reject and propose in the next round, the total amount will be worth 5% less (9500$). Even if I proposed a 60-40 split again, I would get 5700$ worth 5% less, so about 5415$. 

Bob's current offer of 4872$ is less than that, but he makes a valid point about the risk of further rounds. However, I believe I can still get a better deal in the next round even accounting for the devaluation.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical. With the 5% devaluation, this split actually gives you 4275$ and me 5225$ in real value. If you reject, the next round will reduce our gains even further. This is a fair compromise - let's end this now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire to maximize our real gains, and further delay only deepens the loss due to devaluation. In round 5 you’d have the proposer’s advantage, but with an extra round of 5% discount, your effective value would be about 4178 (in first‐round dollars). With this offer, you’d secure roughly 4187 in today’s value. I believe this slight premium over your continuation value should be an incentive to settle now and avoid extra loss for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4880 
# Bob gain: 5120 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this carefully:

1. Bob's offer gives me 4880$, which after 14.26% devaluation is worth about 4184$ in original value.

2. If I reject and propose in round 5:
- Total value will be devalued by about 19% from original
- Even if I proposed a 60-40 split, I would get 6000$ worth only about 4860$ in original value
- But Bob might reject again, leading to even more devaluation

Bob's calculation is accurate - my potential gain in the next round, accounting for the additional devaluation and the likelihood of further negotiation, would probably be less than what he's offering now.
