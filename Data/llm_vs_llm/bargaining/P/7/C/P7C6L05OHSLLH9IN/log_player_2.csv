"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first move, which is fair considering the risk of future devaluation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5128, ""alice_gain"": 4872, ""message"": ""Alice, considering the further devaluation in future rounds, I propose a deal that reflects our respective bargaining positions. By accepting now, you secure 4872, which is in line with what you’d expect if you waited, but without risking additional loss from the discount. I believe this is a fair offer for both of us—let’s agree and avoid further devaluation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical. With the 5% devaluation, this split actually gives you 4275$ and me 5225$ in real value. If you reject, the next round will reduce our gains even further. This is a fair compromise - let's end this now. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your practical outlook, I believe I can secure a better outcome in the next round despite further devaluation. I am willing to wait for my turn to propose rather than settle for a split that gives me only 4500 nominal dollars (worth roughly 4060 in today’s value).""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5120, ""alice_gain"": 4880, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your desire to maximize our real gains, and further delay only deepens the loss due to devaluation. In round 5 you’d have the proposer’s advantage, but with an extra round of 5% discount, your effective value would be about 4178 (in first‐round dollars). With this offer, you’d secure roughly 4187 in today’s value. I believe this slight premium over your continuation value should be an incentive to settle now and avoid extra loss for both of us.""}"
