"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: I get $40, Alice gets $60
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, next round the money will be worth less to me
4. $40 now > $38 (95% of $40) next round

While I could try to negotiate for more, the inflation penalty makes immediate acceptance more attractive. Getting $40 now is better than risking a prolonged negotiation where my purchasing power decreases.
