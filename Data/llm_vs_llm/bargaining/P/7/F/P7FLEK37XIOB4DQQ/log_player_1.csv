"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a relatively fair split, but slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer. I want to avoid going to the next round due to the 20% inflation penalty.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split as it gives Bob a substantial portion while still maintaining a small advantage for myself. It's fair enough that Bob should seriously consider accepting rather than moving to the next round where the total value will decrease."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept, I'll get $4750, but with 20% inflation, it's actually worth $3800
- If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount I get will be worth 40% less
- Bob's inflation is only 5%, so he's not as pressured by time

Given the significant inflation penalty I face and the relatively fair split offered (even accounting for inflation), I should accept this offer. Making a counter-offer would likely result in even less value for me due to the steep inflation penalty.
