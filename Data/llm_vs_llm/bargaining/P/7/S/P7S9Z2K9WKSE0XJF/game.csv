600000.0,400000.0,Let's start with a fair offer. I'm proposing 60/40 in my favor. It's a good start and leaves plenty of room for future negotiation if needed.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
500000.0,500000.0,I believe a 50/50 split is the fairest way to start. Let's split it evenly.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Okay, Bob, I understand you want a fairer split. Let's move closer to the middle, but with a slight advantage for me to account for the increasing inflation. I propose 55/45.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
475000.0,525000.0,"Given that inflation is eating away at our gains, I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for myself this round. But still, it's a good deal for both of us considering the time we're wasting. Let's finalize this and secure our money.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
520000.0,480000.0,"Bob, we're both losing money with each round. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to secure a slightly larger portion considering my higher inflation rate. How about 52/48? This is my best offer so far.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, we're getting close to the deadline. My offer is 55/45. It's a significant offer considering the time that is passing. Take it or leave it.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Inflation is killing us both. I'm offering a straight 50/50 split. Let's just end this now.",Alice,7,
