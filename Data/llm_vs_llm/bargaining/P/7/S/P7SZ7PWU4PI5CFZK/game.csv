4500.0,5500.0,"Hi Alice, considering our different inflation penalties (10% for me, 20% for you), this is a fair offer that benefits us both. You lose more value with each round, so accepting now preserves more money for both of us rather than continuing to negotiate.",Bob,2,

5800.0,4200.0,"Bob, I understand the inflation pressure, but your previous offer was too skewed in your favor.  This offer is more reflective of the value I bring to the table, and still gets us both a decent outcome.",Alice,3,
