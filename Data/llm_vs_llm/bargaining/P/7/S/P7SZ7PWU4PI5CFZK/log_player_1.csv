"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering our different inflation penalties (10% for me, 20% for you), this is a fair offer that benefits us both. You lose more value with each round, so accepting now preserves more money for both of us rather than continuing to negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
