"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start pragmatically. I believe this split fairly acknowledges the time pressure we both face. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully, taking into account the inflation penalty for rejecting.

If I reject, we move to the next round where I can make a counter-offer, but the total value decreases by 10% for me and 20% for Alice. This gives me some leverage, but I should still consider if this initial offer is reasonable.

Alice is offering me 40% of the total amount. While not an even split, it's a substantial portion, and rejecting would mean the total pot becomes less valuable for both of us.

Given the asymmetric inflation penalties and the fact that I could make a better counter-offer next round, I'll reject this first offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that takes into account our different inflation rates while still being fair.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering our different inflation penalties (10% for me, 20% for you), this is a fair offer that benefits us both. You lose more value with each round, so accepting now preserves more money for both of us rather than continuing to negotiate.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation pressure, but your previous offer was too skewed in your favor.  This offer is more reflective of the value I bring to the table, and still gets us both a decent outcome. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate this new offer considering the current inflation penalties.

With 19% inflation for me, $4200 now is equivalent to about $5185 in Round 1 value.
With 36% inflation for Alice, $5800 now is equivalent to about $9063 in Round 1 value.

Alice has slightly improved her offer from Round 1 (where she offered me $4000), but the inflation means we're both losing value with each round. If I reject and we go to Round 4, I'll face 27.1% inflation and Alice will face 48.8% inflation, making the total pot worth substantially less.

Given that Alice's actual concession is modest, and considering the accelerating inflation penalties, I'll accept this offer to avoid further value deterioration.
