"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it mostly in my favor to get this done quickly! We both get a good chunk. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Current offer: $40 for me, $60 for Alice
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 20% less next round
3. Next round I could propose, but Alice might reject, leading to further inflation
4. $40 now is better than $50 after inflation ($40 vs $40 effectively)
5. If negotiations drag on, we risk getting nothing

Given these factors, this is actually a reasonable first offer. While not perfectly equal, it's fair enough considering the inflation risk, and I get a substantial amount.
