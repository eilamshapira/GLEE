"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a fair 50-50 split so we both benefit equally from this game. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's offer of a 50-50 split, which would give me $50.

This is a completely fair division that gives both of us equal amounts. In bargaining games like this, equal splits are generally considered fair and reasonable. I have no strategic advantage in rejecting this offer since I might not get a better deal in subsequent rounds.
