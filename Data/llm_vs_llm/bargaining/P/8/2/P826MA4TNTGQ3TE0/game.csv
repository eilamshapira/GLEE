487400.0,512600.0,"Alice, time is money—literally. To avoid further inflation losses, I propose a 51.26%–48.74% split (512600 for me and 487400 for you) in this round. This offer reflects the slight advantage of being the proposer now while ensuring you receive as much as you could expect if you waited. Let's settle this efficiently.",Bob,2,
