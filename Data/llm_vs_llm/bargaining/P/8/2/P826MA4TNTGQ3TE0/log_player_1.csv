"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's make this fair and efficient - I propose a 55-45 split to save us both from inflation losses in future rounds.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, time is money—literally. To avoid further inflation losses, I propose a 51.26%–48.74% split (512600 for me and 487400 for you) in this round. This offer reflects the slight advantage of being the proposer now while ensuring you receive as much as you could expect if you waited. Let's settle this efficiently. 
# Alice gain: 487400 
# Bob gain: 512600 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $487,400 (worth 5% less due to inflation)
- Real value = $487,400 * 0.95 = $463,030

If I reject:
- Next round will have another 5% inflation (total 10% from original)
- I would need to propose a split that Bob would accept
- Even if I could get a larger nominal amount, it would be worth less

Bob's offer is actually quite reasonable:
1. It accounts for the inflation impact
2. The split is close to 50-50
3. Further negotiations would reduce both our gains
