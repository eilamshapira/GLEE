"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I rejected your offer because I believe a 50-50 split is more fair. Considering the inflation risk, I'm willing to compromise at 55-45 in my favor, given that I'm making the offer in this round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Reasoning (not part of response): I'll accept this offer because:
1. With 10% inflation, my $45 is now worth $40.50
2. If I reject, the next round will have another 10% inflation
3. The difference between Bob's offer and what I proposed isn't large enough to risk further inflation
4. A 55-45 split is relatively fair
5. There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in future rounds"
