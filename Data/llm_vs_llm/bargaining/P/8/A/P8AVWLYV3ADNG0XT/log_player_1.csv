"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I want to be fair, but also account for the inflation I'm facing. Given the 12 round limit and the potential for no payout if we don't agree, I will start with a relatively generous offer.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

My reasoning is: I am offering Bob a significant portion upfront to increase the chance of acceptance. I keep a slightly larger portion to account for the risk I am taking and the future inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I see. Bob is trying to get more, but his money is losing value faster than mine. I need to consider this carefully.

My money is worth 5% less, so $5500 from round 1 is equivalent to $5225 now.
Bob's offer is $6000 for me, and $4000 for him.

Let's calculate the value for Bob in round 1 dollar. That would be $4000 * (1 + 20%) = $4800

Comparing the offers:
* My offer in round 1: $5500 for me, $4500 for Bob.
* Bob's offer now: $6000 for me (worth $5700 due to my inflation), $4000 for him (worth $4800 due to his inflation).

Bob's offer is better for me than what I proposed originally, even considering inflation! I will accept.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
