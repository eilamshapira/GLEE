"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000 pot, which is 40% of the total. If I reject this offer, I can make my own proposal in the next round, but due to inflation, the entire pot will be worth 10% less to me, meaning it would effectively be worth $900,000 to me in the next round.

If I accept now, I get $400,000. If I reject and propose my own split next round, I would need to get more than $444,444 (which is equivalent to $400,000 now after accounting for the 10% inflation) to make rejection worthwhile.

Given that I don't know how inflation affects Alice, and $400,000 is a substantial amount, I'll accept this offer.
