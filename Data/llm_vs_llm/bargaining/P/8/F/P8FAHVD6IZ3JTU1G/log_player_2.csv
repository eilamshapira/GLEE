"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $4,500 out of $10,000, which is 45% of the total. 

If I reject, I can make my own offer next round. Since Alice faces 20% inflation per round, in the next round $10,000 would only be worth $8,000 to her. This gives me leverage to potentially get a better deal.

Given that I don't face any inflation penalty, it might be strategically advantageous to reject this first offer and make my own proposal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I'm now making the offer, I need to consider how the inflation affects Alice's decision-making. After this round, the $10,000 will only be worth $8,000 to Alice (20% less value), while it maintains full value for me.

Given this asymmetry, I can propose a split that's more favorable to me while still being rational for Alice to accept rather than delay further and lose more value.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering Alice $4,000, which is worth the full $4,000 to her right now. If she rejects and we go to another round, the entire pot would be worth even less to her due to her 20% inflation penalty, so this should be a reasonable offer that considers our different time preferences."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is now offering me $5,000 out of $10,000, which is 50% of the total. This is better than her first offer of $4,500.

For Alice, the $5,000 she would receive is now worth only 64% of its original value due to the 36% inflation she faces (approximately $3,200 in round 1 value to her).

If I reject and we go to round 4, Alice will face even more inflation (about 49% total from round 1), making the money worth even less to her. This gives me leverage for a potentially better offer in round 4.

However, the offer of $5,000 is quite reasonable, and there's always risk in continuing negotiation. Since I don't face any inflation penalty, I'm getting 50% of the total amount at full value.
