"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's fair offer against the impact of inflation.

If I accept now, I get $5000.
If I reject and propose in round 2, the total value is reduced by 10% for me, so I'd need to get more than $5000 รท 0.9 = $5555.56 to come out ahead.

Given that we have 12 potential rounds and I'll face 10% inflation each round, accepting a fair 50-50 split now seems reasonable rather than risking further devaluation.
