"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, 50-50. It's a good start for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

With a 5% depreciation per round for me, and no depreciation for Alice, waiting could cost me money. If I reject now and propose in the next round, my $5000 would only be worth $4750 due to the 5% loss.

The 50-50 split is fair in absolute terms, and given the asymmetric depreciation that affects only me, it's actually a pretty good offer. If I try to negotiate for more in later rounds, the depreciation will eat into my gains.
