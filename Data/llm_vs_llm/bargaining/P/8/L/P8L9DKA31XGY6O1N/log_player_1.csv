"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to make a fair offer, considering that inflation will affect me more than Bob if we drag this out. Since I'm losing 10% each round compared to Bob's 5%, I should propose a division that's appealing enough for Bob to accept immediately.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering a slightly better deal for myself since I'm the first mover, but it's fair enough that Bob should find it reasonable to accept rather than moving to the next round where inflation will affect both of us."
