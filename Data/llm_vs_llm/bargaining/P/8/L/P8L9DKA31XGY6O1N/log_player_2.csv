"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's proposal gives me $4500 while she gets $5500. This isn't an even split, but I need to consider the inflation factor. If I reject and we go to the next round, the total amount will be worth less to both of us - 5% less for me and 10% less for Alice.

If I reject, in the next round I'd be proposing with the money being worth 5% less to me, so the $10,000 would effectively be worth $9,500 to me. Since I'd be making the offer, I could propose a better split for myself, but Alice might reject if she feels it's unfair.

Considering the inflation penalties and the reasonable amount offered, I'll accept this proposal.
