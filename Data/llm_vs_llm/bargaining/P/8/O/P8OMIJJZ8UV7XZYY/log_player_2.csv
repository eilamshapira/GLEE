"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split the money equally. Accepting this offer now avoids any risks in later rounds and ensures we both walk away with $50. What do you think?

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, 
""alice_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I think I deserve a bit more for taking the risk of going to the next round. This is still a generous offer considering the potential loss due to inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in light of the inflation hitting proposals over rounds, I want to help us both secure as much real value as we can. Remember that with every round, the nominal money you receive loses more of its purchasing power. By accepting this offer in round 3, you get $55 nominal immediately—roughly translating to more real value than waiting for round 4 where further inflation would bite (for example, even if you could secure a similar nominal amount later, the discount would be even deeper). I’m offering $45 for myself, keeping my share at full value, which is a fair compromise given the circumstances. Let’s close the deal now instead of risking further loss for you. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45

Round 4

""alice_gain"": 43, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your concern about the inflation, but I still think I can get a better deal. Considering the loss of value over rounds, I'm willing to take the risk for a slightly higher nominal amount. This offer is still reasonable, and I'm hoping we can settle on this.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I know that waiting might seem like it could secure a higher share for you, but with further rounds the inflation will only hit your portion even harder. By locking in this deal now, you secure $60 nominal immediately—which is better than risking further devaluation. I’m keeping my share at $40, which remains at full value for me. Let's avoid the risk of further lost value and close the deal now. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40
