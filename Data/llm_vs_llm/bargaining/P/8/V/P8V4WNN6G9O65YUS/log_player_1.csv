"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'm Alice, and I need to make an offer to divide $1,000,000 with Bob. I should be mindful that the money devalues for me by 20% each round, while it doesn't lose value for Bob.

Given the inflation penalty I face, it makes sense to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. However, I also want to maximize my share. Since this is the first round, I'll offer a split that favors me somewhat but is still reasonable enough that Bob might accept it.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This gives Bob a substantial portion of the money while allowing me to secure a good share before inflation reduces the value for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I see that Bob and I are negotiating, and we've both rejected each other's initial offers. Given that the money devalues for me by 20% each round, I need to consider a more balanced proposal to reach an agreement before inflation significantly reduces my share's value.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This is more favorable to Bob than my previous offer while still giving me a reasonable share. Since we're now in round 3, and the money has already devalued by 20% twice for me, it's becoming increasingly important to reach an agreement soon."
