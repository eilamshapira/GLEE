"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Based on backward‐induction reasoning—and taking into account that from round 2 onward any money you (Alice) receive will be discounted by 10% per round while Bob’s money is not discounted—the equilibrium outcome forces you, as the first proposer, into a tough position. If you try to keep any money for yourself, Bob can rationally reject your offer because when it’s his turn (with no discounting on his share) he can propose a split that gives him nearly the entire $100 while offering you almost nothing (and you’d be even worse‐off because of the 10% discount in subsequent rounds).

Bob’s alternative (the threat) is effectively $100 in full value. To make him indifferent between accepting your proposal and waiting for his turn, you would have to offer him the full $100 now.

Thus, in round 1 the subgame perfect equilibrium offers are:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 0,
  ""bob_gain"": 100
}

Bob will accept this offer (or is at least not motivated to delay), and the game ends immediately."
