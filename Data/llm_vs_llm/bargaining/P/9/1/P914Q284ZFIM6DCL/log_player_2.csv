"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. Alice is offering me 4000$ while taking 6000$ for herself. While this isn't an equal split, getting 4000$ is still a significant amount. However, even with the 10% inflation penalty for the next round, I could propose a more favorable split and potentially get more.

In the next round, the total amount would be worth 9000$, and I could propose a more equitable distribution.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split, slightly in my favor since Alice tried to take a larger share in the first round, but not too aggressive to increase chances of acceptance.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split as it's closer to an equal division while giving me a slight advantage. It's more fair than Alice's initial offer, and given that rejection would lead to further devaluation of the total amount, it should be a reasonable proposal for Alice to consider."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice's new offer gives me 4200$, which is slightly better than her first offer of 4000$
2. However, due to 19% inflation, 4200$ now is actually worth about 3402$ in original value
3. If I reject, the next round will have a 29% total inflation
4. My previous offer of a more balanced split was rejected
5. Alice seems to be playing somewhat aggressively

Given that the value is rapidly decreasing and Alice has only slightly improved her offer, I'll reject once more to try to negotiate a better deal. The inflation penalty is significant, but I believe there's still room for a more favorable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that we're now in round 4 and previous attempts at a more balanced split were rejected, I'll make a more moderate offer to increase chances of acceptance. The total value is decreasing significantly with each round, so it's becoming more important to reach an agreement.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I propose an exactly equal split. This is completely fair to both parties, and given the mounting inflation pressure (the next round would have 39% inflation), this should be an attractive offer for Alice. It's better for both of us to agree now than to continue negotiations with further devaluation."
