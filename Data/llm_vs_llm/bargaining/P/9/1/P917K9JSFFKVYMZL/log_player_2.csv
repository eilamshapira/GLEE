"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice's offer gives me $100,000, it's quite unbalanced in her favor. Since the money loses value at different rates for us (5% for me vs 10% for Alice), I have some leverage in later rounds. By rejecting, I can make a counterproposal that's more equitable, and the declining value will affect Alice more significantly than me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more equitable split that accounts for our different inflation rates.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose we split the money equally. This is a fair division that gives us both substantial value, and considering the different inflation rates affecting us, an immediate resolution benefits both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has increased her offer to me, but it's still heavily skewed in her favor. The inflation impact is growing, but affects her more than me. Since I'll have another opportunity to make a counter-offer if I reject, and her money is devaluing faster than mine, I believe I can negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given the increasing inflation pressure (especially on Alice) and our previous rejected offers, I'll propose a more strategic split that's still reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000}

I propose a 45/55 split in Alice's favor. This is a reasonable compromise that acknowledges both parties need to find middle ground. With inflation reducing the value by nearly 10% for me and 19% for Alice already, further delays significantly harm both our interests, but especially Alice's. This offer represents a fair solution that allows us both to maximize our value."
