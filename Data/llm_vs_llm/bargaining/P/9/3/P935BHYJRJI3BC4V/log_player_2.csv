"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest we split the money equally. This is a fair division that gives us both a substantial amount. With inflation affecting me by 10% each round, delays will cost us both, so accepting now maximizes our combined gain. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing a 50-50 split, which would give me $500,000. Since I know my inflation rate is 5% per round, if I reject this and we go another round, the total value to me decreases by 5%. 

Alice mentioned her inflation rate is 10%, but I don't actually know if that's true - the instructions said I don't know how inflation affects Alice. This could be a negotiation tactic.

A 50-50 split is generally considered fair, and I'd be getting a substantial amount. If I reject and try to negotiate for more in the next round, I risk losing 5% value and Alice might make a less favorable offer.
