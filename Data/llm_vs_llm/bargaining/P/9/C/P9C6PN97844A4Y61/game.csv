45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your fair offer, but given the uncertainties of inflation, I'm proposing $55 for me and $45 for you. This seems reasonable considering I rejected the initial 50-50 split. I hope you understand!",Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, as we both know, every additional round further diminishes the value of your share due to inflation. With this in mind, I propose a 55/45 split in my favor—55 for me and 45 for you—so that you secure a decent return before further rounds cut into your gains. I believe this is a fair compromise given the circumstances. What do you think?",Alice,3,

48.0,52.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. I'm proposing $52 for me and $48 for you. This way, we are both recovering a bit of what was lost due to earlier rejections. I hope we can agree on this.",Bob,4,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your effort, but I believe we have room to secure an even better outcome considering the inflation effects on your share. Let's move on to the next round where I'll propose a division that I think will be more mutually beneficial.",Alice,4,reject
54.0,46.0,"Hi Bob, to account for the increasing inflation impact on your share in subsequent rounds, I'm offering a split of $54 for me and $46 for you. By accepting this now, you'll secure a higher effective value than waiting and risking further devaluation. I believe this is a fair compromise given our current situation. What do you think?",Alice,5,
