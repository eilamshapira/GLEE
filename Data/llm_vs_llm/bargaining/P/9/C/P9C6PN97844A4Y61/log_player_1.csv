Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your fair offer, but given the uncertainties of inflation, I'm proposing $55 for me and $45 for you. This seems reasonable considering I rejected the initial 50-50 split. I hope you understand! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3

With this in mind, I propose a 55/45 split in my favor—55 for me and 45 for you—so that you secure a decent return before further rounds cut into your gains. I believe this is a fair compromise given the circumstances. What do you think?""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
