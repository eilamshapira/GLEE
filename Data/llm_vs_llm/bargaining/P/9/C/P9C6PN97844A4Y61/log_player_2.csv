Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, as we both know, every additional round further diminishes the value of your share due to inflation. With this in mind, I propose a 55/45 split in my favor—55 for me and 45 for you—so that you secure a decent return before further rounds cut into your gains. I believe this is a fair compromise given the circumstances. What do you think?
