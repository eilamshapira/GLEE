"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer that considers the inflation rates for both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 560000, 
""bob_gain"": 440000}

Since Bob faces a higher inflation rate (20% per round versus my 10%), it's in his interest to reach an agreement quickly. I'm offering him a substantial portion while still keeping the larger share for myself given our different time preferences."
