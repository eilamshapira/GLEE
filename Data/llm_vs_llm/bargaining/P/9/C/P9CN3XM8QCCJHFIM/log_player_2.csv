"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing I receive $440,000 while she gets $560,000.

If I reject and we move to another round, inflation will reduce the value of my share by 20%, while Alice's share would only decrease by 10%. This means the total value of the money will be worth less to me in future rounds than it is to Alice.

Let me calculate: If I reject, the $1,000,000 would effectively be worth only $800,000 to me in the next round, while it would be worth $900,000 to Alice. The asymmetric inflation puts me at a disadvantage in later rounds.

While Alice's current offer gives her more money, the difference isn't extreme, and the inflation penalty for rejecting makes this a reasonable offer.
