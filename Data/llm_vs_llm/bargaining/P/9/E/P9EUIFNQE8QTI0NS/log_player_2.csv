Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we settle now: I take $550000 and you get $450000. Accepting today avoids further inflation losses on my share, and it ensures we both secure a substantial, real value portion of the money. Let's close the deal quickly for mutual benefit. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000
