Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, given the discounting we both face as rounds progress, I propose this division. It reflects a fair split based on our respective devaluations—by accepting now, you secure an effective value equal to what you’d get if you waited, while we both avoid further loss in value. I look forward to your acceptance. 
# Alice gain: 310345 
# Bob gain: 689655 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
