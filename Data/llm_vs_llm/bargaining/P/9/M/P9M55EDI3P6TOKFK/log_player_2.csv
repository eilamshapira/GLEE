"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer of a 50-50 split.

Pros:
- It's a fair and equal division
- Guarantees a significant amount ($500,000)
- Avoids the risk of future negotiations failing
- Shows good faith from Alice

While I could try to negotiate for more, this is a very reasonable first offer. There's a risk that if I reject it, future negotiations might lead to worse outcomes or even failure to reach an agreement within 12 rounds.
