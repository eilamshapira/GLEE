"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split that slightly favors me since Bob has the power to accept or reject.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose this division because:
1. It's close to a 50-50 split, which is generally seen as fair
2. I give myself a small advantage since I'm moving first
3. If Bob rejects, the next round will have 5% inflation for me, so this offer is better than waiting"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. My potential $45 is now worth only $42.75 (due to 5% inflation)
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, any amount I get will be worth another 5% less
3. Bob's offer is basically the reverse of my initial offer
4. Given the inflation penalty, I'm better off accepting now than trying to negotiate further
