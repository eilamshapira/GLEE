60.0,40.0,I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering I am the one facing inflation.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. Given the inflation affecting your share more, this offer still leaves you with a significant portion while compensating for my patience in the game.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, let's be reasonable. I'm offering you 45 which is a lot more than the 40 I offered last round.  Don't forget, the longer this goes on the less value my offers will have for me - and the less you'll end up with.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
50.0,50.0,"Alice, I propose an even split of 50/50. Considering the significant impact of inflation on your share, this offer is fair and equitable. It's time we end this game on a balanced note.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,accept
