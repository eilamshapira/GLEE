Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. I'm offering you 45 which is a lot more than the 40 I offered last round.  Don't forget, the longer this goes on the less value my offers will have for me - and the less you'll end up with.

# Alice gain: 55
