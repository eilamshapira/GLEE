Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{

  ""bob_gain"": 40
}

Explanation: I offer Bob $40 while I keep $60. This is a reasonable starting offer that gives both of us a significant portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50

Explanation: To account for inflation and make a fair offer, I propose an equal split of the money. This way, both Alice and Bob receive $50 each."
