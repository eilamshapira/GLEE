"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering we both need to reach an agreement quickly to avoid losing value to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it fairly, considering the inflation. I'm willing to compromise, but I expect a reasonable counteroffer if you reject this. 
# Alice gain: 5250 
# Bob gain: 4750 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The reason I accept is that:
1. Due to inflation, my $5250 is actually worth $4987.50 (95% of original value)
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer, any amount I get will be worth another 5% less
3. Bob's offer is relatively fair, giving me slightly more than half
4. The risk of further negotiation rounds and value loss outweighs the potential gain from a marginally better split"
