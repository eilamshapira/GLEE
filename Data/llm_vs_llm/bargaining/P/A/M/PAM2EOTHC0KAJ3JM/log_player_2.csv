"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering we both need to reach an agreement quickly to avoid losing value to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me after the first round, the total amount I consider is now $10,000 * 0.95 = $9,500.

To make a fair offer, I'll suggest a 50-50 split of the original $10,000, but considering the inflation, I'll adjust it to 50-50 of the $9,500.
