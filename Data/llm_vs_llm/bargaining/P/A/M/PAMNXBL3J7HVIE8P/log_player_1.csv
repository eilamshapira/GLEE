"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I understand that I'm playing as Alice in this game to divide $1,000,000 with Bob. I need to make an offer first, and I should be mindful that with each passing round, the money is worth 20% less to me while its value doesn't decrease for Bob.

Given this asymmetric time pressure, I should propose a fair division that Bob would likely accept immediately, since delaying would hurt my position more than his.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm offering you $400,000, Bob, which is a substantial portion of the money. This is a fair offer considering that if we go to another round, the total value will be worth less to me, putting me at a disadvantage in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting this offer because even with the 20% inflation penalty, I can still make a better counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to be strategic here since the money is worth another 20% less to me in this round (so now worth 64% of the original value to me).

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

Bob, I'm offering a perfectly equal split of $500,000 each. This is fair and balanced. If you reject this and we go to another round, the delay will significantly hurt my position due to the 20% inflation I face each round. This 50-50 split represents a reasonable compromise that benefits us both - please consider accepting so we can both walk away with substantial value."
