"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer seems quite imbalanced in her favor, offering her 8000$ and only 2000$ to me. Since there's no inflation penalty for me (0% less), I can safely reject this offer and propose a more equitable division in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more balanced division of the money.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I believe an equal split is fair for both of us. This way we each receive half of the total amount."
