"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 208333, ""bob_gain"": 791667, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'd like to settle now rather than risk further value loss. Given that every round costs me 20% of the money while you only lose 5%, my proposal is that I take $208,333 and you get $791,667. I believe this split fairly reflects our different time‐preferences and ensures you at least as much as you’d expect if you waited to propose in Round 2. Let’s agree on this division and avoid unnecessary delays!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the urgency given the penalty differences. However, since my penalty is lower, I'd like to propose $850000 for me and $150000 for you. This way we both preserve some value before further losses. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
