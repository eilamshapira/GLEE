"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'd like to settle now rather than risk further value loss. Given that every round costs me 20% of the money while you only lose 5%, my proposal is that I take $208333 and you get $791667. I believe this split fairly reflects our different time‐preferences and ensures you at least as much as you’d expect if you waited to propose in Round 2. Let’s agree on this division and avoid unnecessary delays! 
# Bob gain: 791667 
# Alice gain: 208333 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 850000, ""alice_gain"": 150000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand the urgency given the penalty differences. However, since my penalty is lower, I'd like to propose $850,000 for me and $150,000 for you. This way we both preserve some value before further losses. Let me know your thoughts!""}"
