"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair offer that acknowledges the inflation penalty I face.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000. This slight advantage for me helps offset the 10% inflation penalty I'll face if we need another round. It's a reasonable split that gives both of us a substantial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'm getting slightly less than half at $480,000, the inflation penalty means rejecting would cost me 10% more value in the next round. Since we both face inflation penalties (mine at 10%, Bob's at 20%), accepting $480,000 now is better than risking further devaluation. This is a reasonable compromise that gives me substantial value."
