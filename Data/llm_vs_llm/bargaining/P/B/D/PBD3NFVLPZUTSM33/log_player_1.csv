Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I need to factor in the inflation for myself. The money I gain is now worth 20% less than in the first round. Bob's money is still worth the same.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1500 
# Bob gain: 8500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the inflation and what I stand to lose if I reject. The money is worth quite a bit less now. Let's calculate the actual value:

*   Original value: $1500
*   Inflation discount: 27.1%
*   Value after inflation: $1500 * (1 - 0.271) = $1093.50

Given the significant inflation, accepting this offer provides some value, and rejecting might lead to even worse offers later.
