"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing an equal split of the money ($5,000 each).

Since there's no inflation effect for me, the value of $5,000 will remain $5,000 regardless of which round we conclude the game. This means I'm not pressured to accept early due to declining value.

However, we only have 12 rounds total, and if we can't reach an agreement by then, we both get nothing. Given this is a fair 50-50 split right from the start, and I have no strategic advantage in waiting (since my money doesn't lose value), accepting now seems reasonable.
