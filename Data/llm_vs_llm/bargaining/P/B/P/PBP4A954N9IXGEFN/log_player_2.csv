"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. 

Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which is perfectly fair. Since I don't know how inflation affects Alice, but I know it doesn't affect me (0% inflation for me), there's no strategic advantage for me to delay and make a counter-offer.

A 50-50 split is equitable, and accepting now guarantees me $50 rather than risking potential disagreement in later rounds.
