"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair and split it evenly, 50/50. What do you say, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Looking at Alice's offer of a 50/50 split, I'll evaluate this rationally.

With no inflation affecting me, $50 now is worth the same as $50 later. Since there's no disadvantage to me in waiting, I could try to get a better deal in the next round when I make the proposal.

However, I should consider:
1. There's a limited number of rounds (12)
2. I don't know how inflation affects Alice, which might influence her future decisions
3. A 50/50 split is objectively fair

Since this is already a fair offer and there's risk in rejecting it (Alice might be less generous later), I'll accept.
