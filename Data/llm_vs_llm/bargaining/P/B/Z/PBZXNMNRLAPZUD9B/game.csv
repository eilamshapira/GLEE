650000.0,350000.0,"Let's be fair, Bob. This offer ensures you get a good deal right away.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
166667.0,833333.0,"Alice, waiting will cost you a lot due to heavy devaluation. Accept my offer now and secure a fair, guaranteed share rather than risk getting less in later rounds.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, my friend, I'm feeling generous today. Let's end this and both walk away with a decent chunk.",Alice,3,
,,"Alice, your offer leaves me with 450000 before discount—effectively about 406125 in real value. Given that if I reject now I’ll be the proposer in the next round (where my money is discounted by only about 14% and you face a harsher 49% discount), I can secure a far better deal. I'm passing on this offer.",Bob,3,reject
166667.0,833333.0,"Alice, by waiting another round your share will drop further in value (down to about 40.96% of its nominal value). This division gives you exactly what you'd expect in a fair continuation, while I secure my advantage. Accept this offer now to avoid further devaluation.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Let's be real, a 50/50 split is the only fair solution at this point. Take it or leave it.",Alice,5,
,,"Alice, a strict 50/50 split in this round gives me an effective share of roughly $407250—which is far less than the advantage I can secure when it's my turn to propose in the next round. Your money is devaluing much faster than mine, so if we continue, I can structure an offer that leaves you with considerably less. I’m rejecting your proposal; let's proceed to the next round.",Bob,5,reject
100000.0,900000.0,"Alice, time is not on your side. In round 6, every dollar for you is now only worth about 32.77% of its face value, while mine retains about 77.38%. By accepting this offer, you secure an effective gain of roughly $32768, which is far better than what you'll command if the game drags on further. I’m offering you 100000 nominal dollars—act now and avoid deeper losses.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
200000.0,800000.0,"Bob, it's clear you're happy to play this game for a long time.  This is my final offer. Take it, and we both walk away with something. Reject it, and we'll see how long you're willing to wait for your shrinking prize.",Alice,7,
,,"Alice, look at the numbers: your offer gives me 800000 nominal dollars, but with the 26.49% discount that's only about 588000 in real value, while you end up with a paltry sum. By turning this down, I step into the proposer’s seat in the next round, where I can exploit the even harsher inflation on your side to secure almost the entire pie for myself. I’m not willing to settle for anything less than the advantage I can capitalize on in the coming round.",Bob,7,reject
50000.0,950000.0,"Alice, every passing round drains your share far more than mine. If you refuse now, you’ll face even more severe devaluation in your next proposal—leaving you with a fraction of today's value. Accept this division: while I secure 950000 nominal dollars, your 50000 now is a better deal than what waiting would guarantee.",Bob,8,
