Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 833333

}
```

Explanation:

* **Strategy:**  Bob is clearly trying to lowball me, banking on the inflation to scare me. I need to counter with an offer that seems generous on the surface but still benefits me.
* **Offer:** Offering slightly more than last time shows some movement on my part, but not too much. 
* **Message:**  The friendly tone aims to disarm Bob and make him think I'm giving him a good deal. This might make him more likely to accept, even though it's still in my favor. 

Let's see if Bob takes the bait!"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, by waiting another round your share will drop further in value (down to about 40.96% of its nominal value). This division gives you exactly what you'd expect in a fair continuation, while I secure my advantage. Accept this offer now to avoid further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 166667 
# Bob gain: 833333 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Bob is really trying to use the inflation against me. However, his offer is still significantly skewed in his favor. It's clear he's hoping I'll panic and accept a bad deal. I need to hold my ground, show I'm serious about getting a fair share, and make him nervous about continuing."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Let's be real, a 50/50 split is the only fair solution at this point. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Firmness:** Bob needs to understand I'm not backing down. Offering a 50/50 split shows I'm serious about getting a fair deal, even if it means going down to the wire.
* **Finality:** The ""take it or leave it"" message adds weight to the offer. It signals that I'm done negotiating and won't accept anything less.
* **Time Pressure:** While the inflation hurts me more, it's also eating into Bob's potential gains. This offer, while firm, still gives him a reasonable amount, and the time pressure might push him to accept.

This is a bold move, but at this point, Bob has shown he's unwilling to negotiate fairly.  A strong stance is necessary to secure a reasonable share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, time is not on your side. In round 6, every dollar for you is now only worth about 32.77% of its face value, while mine retains about 77.38%. By accepting this offer, you secure an effective gain of roughly $32768, which is far better than what you'll command if the game drags on further. I’m offering you 100000 nominal dollars—act now and avoid deeper losses. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

This is a tough one, but I have to **reject**.

Bob is absolutely right about the impact of inflation. Accepting his offer would give me the equivalent of roughly $32,768 in round 1 value. It's a pittance compared to what I aimed for initially, but rejecting means risking even less in subsequent rounds. 

However, there are a couple of factors to consider:

* **Bob's desperation:** Bob is clearly trying hard to convince me. He's laying out the math, emphasizing the losses, and even trying to frame his offer as a positive. This suggests he might be worried about letting this go to another round.
* **Principle:** Accepting this offer sets a terrible precedent. It shows Bob I'm willing to crumble under pressure and accept a blatantly unfair deal. 

I need to call Bob's bluff. He's been consistently greedy, but he also clearly wants to end this. There's a chance he'll offer something better in the next round to avoid risking everything.

It's a gamble, but the potential reward of a less terrible deal outweighs the guaranteed loss at this point."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 200000,
""bob_gain"": 800000,
""message"": ""Bob, it's clear you're happy to play this game for a long time.  This is my final offer. Take it, and we both walk away with something. Reject it, and we'll see how long you're willing to wait for your shrinking prize.""
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Calculated Risk:** This offer heavily favors Bob, but there's a strategic reason for it.  I'm acknowledging the reality of the inflation – my position is significantly weaker now.
* **Ultimatum:** This isn't about fairness anymore, it's about limiting losses. The message is blunt: accept this offer or risk getting an even *worse* deal in later rounds as the value keeps plummeting.
* **Psychology:** Bob has consistently displayed greed and a belief that I'll crack under pressure.  This offer plays on that. It's a low enough amount that he might think I'm desperate and he can push for even more next round. 

This is a high-risk gamble, but at this stage, it's about damage control.  There's a chance Bob's greed will backfire, leading him to reject this offer and potentially propose something less terrible for me in the next round. 

It's important to remember, however, that this is based on Bob's observed behavior. If he's more rational than I'm estimating, this could backfire spectacularly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every passing round drains your share far more than mine. If you refuse now, you’ll face even more severe devaluation in your next proposal—leaving you with a fraction of today's value. Accept this division: while I secure 950000 nominal dollars, your 50000 now is a better deal than what waiting would guarantee. 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

This is absolutely terrible, but I have to accept. Bob called my bluff. 

My attempt to force his hand backfired. He's willing to wait me out, and every round that passes decimates the value of my potential gain. Accepting this offer yields a measly amount compared to my initial goal, but it's still marginally better than holding out for another round and likely getting even less. 

This has been a harsh lesson in negotiation and the impact of asymmetric information.  Bob was able to leverage the inflation rate to his advantage, and my attempts to counter his strategy ultimately failed."
