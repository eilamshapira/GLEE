Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 833333, ""alice_gain"": 166667, ""message"": ""Alice, waiting will cost you a lot due to heavy devaluation. Accept my offer now and secure a fair, guaranteed share rather than risk getting less in later rounds.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my friend, I'm feeling generous today. Let's end this and both walk away with a decent chunk. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Alice, your offer leaves me with 450,000 before discount—effectively about 406,125 in real value. Given that if I reject now I’ll be the proposer in the next round (where my money is discounted by only about 14% and you face a harsher 49% discount), I can secure a far better deal. I'm passing on this offer.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Let's be real, a 50/50 split is the only fair solution at this point. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Alice, a strict 50/50 split in this round gives me an effective share of roughly $407,250—which is far less than the advantage I can secure when it's my turn to propose in the next round. Your money is devaluing much faster than mine, so if we continue, I can structure an offer that leaves you with considerably less. I’m rejecting your proposal; let's proceed to the next round.""}"

In round 6, every dollar for you is now only worth about 32.77% of its face value, while mine retains about 77.38%. By accepting this offer, you secure an effective gain of roughly $32,768, which is far better than what you'll command if the game drags on further.

Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Alice, look at the numbers: your offer gives me 800,000 nominal dollars, but with the 26.49% discount that's only about 588,000 in real value, while you end up with a paltry sum. By turning this down, I step into the proposer’s seat in the next round, where I can exploit the even harsher inflation on your side to secure almost the entire pie for myself. I’m not willing to settle for anything less than the advantage I can capitalize on in the coming round.""}"
