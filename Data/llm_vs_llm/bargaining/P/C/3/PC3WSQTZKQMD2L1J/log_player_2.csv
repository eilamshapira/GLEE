"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is proposing that I receive $4,000 while she gets $6,000 out of the total $10,000. This gives me 40% of the total amount, which is a decent offer in the first round, though not equal. However, if I reject, I'll get to make a counter-offer in the next round, which could potentially be more favorable to me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more equitable division while still acknowledging that Alice made the first move.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an equal 50-50 split of the money, which I believe is the fairest division. We both receive $5,000 each, which represents an equal share of the total amount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has increased her offer to me from $4,000 to $4,500, which is a step in the right direction. She's now offering a 45%-55% split, which is more balanced than her initial offer. However, it's still not the equal division I proposed in round 2.

If I reject, I'll get another chance to make an offer in round 4, but there's also a risk that we could end up with less favorable outcomes if the negotiation continues for too many rounds.
