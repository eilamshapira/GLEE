"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. I'm being offered $5,500 (55% of the total)
2. If I reject, we move to round 2, where:
   * My money will be worth 20% less
   * Alice's money will be worth 5% less
   * I get to make the next offer

$5,500 in the first round is a decent offer. If I reject, my $5,500 would be worth only $4,400 in the next round due to the 20% inflation. Since I have the worse inflation rate, it's in my interest to conclude the deal earlier rather than later.

Given these factors, this is a fair first offer and the inflation penalty makes waiting risky for me.
