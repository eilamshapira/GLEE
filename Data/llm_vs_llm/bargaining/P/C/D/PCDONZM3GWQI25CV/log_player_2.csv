"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share, considering the inflation rate difference 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether I should accept this offer, let's calculate the value of the money for both of us in the current round and consider how it changes over rounds.

In Round 1, the total amount is $100. Alice offers $40 to me and $60 to herself.

For me (Bob), the money is worth 100% in Round 1, but it decreases by 5% each round. So, if I accept, I get $40 now. If I reject, I have to consider the decrease in value over rounds.

For Alice, the money is worth 100% in Round 1, but it decreases by 20% each round.

Given that Alice's offer gives me $40 and her $60, and considering the significant difference in inflation rates (5% for me vs. 20% for Alice), I should evaluate if waiting could benefit me more due to Alice's higher inflation rate.

However, since this is the first round and the difference in offer ($40 vs. $60) is significant, and considering that I don't know how Alice will behave in subsequent rounds, it might be wise to consider accepting this offer to secure some value rather than risking further devaluation.

But, let's think about the next round. If I reject and make a counteroffer in the next round, the total value of the money would decrease. For me, $100 would become $95 (100 - 5% of 100), and for Alice, it would become $80 (100 - 20% of 100). This could potentially give me more bargaining power in the next round.

Given these considerations and the fact that we have 12 rounds to come to an agreement, I think it's reasonable to reject this initial offer and see how the next round plays out, hoping to secure a better deal as the rounds progress and Alice's share devalues more significantly than mine.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Now it's my turn to make an offer. Considering the inflation rates and the fact that Alice's share devalues more quickly, I want to make an offer that is reasonable but also takes into account the changing value of the money.

Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Alice each round, after Round 1, the effective value for me would be $95 (100 - 5% of 100) and for Alice would be $80 (100 - 20% of 100).

However, for the sake of the offer, we still consider the original $100, as the game's structure implies that the division is based on the initial amount, and the inflation affects the perceived value after the division.

I'll offer a split that slightly favors me, considering the inflation disparity, but is still within a reasonable range to encourage acceptance or a counteroffer that could work in my favor in subsequent rounds.

Let's say I offer $55 to myself and $45 to Alice. This offer acknowledges Alice's higher inflation rate but also ensures I'm securing a significant portion of the initial $100.

My message to Alice would be: ""Considering the inflation rates, this offer balances our interests while reflecting the changing value of our shares.""

So, my offer in JSON format is:
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation rates, this offer balances our interests while reflecting the changing value of our shares.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer, factoring in the increasing inflation disparity 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that Alice rejected my offer in Round 2, we've moved to Round 3. The inflation has affected the value of the money for both of us: my share is worth 9.75% less than in Round 1, and Alice's share is worth 36% less.

In Round 3, Alice offers me $42 and herself $58. This offer is slightly better for me than her initial offer in Round 1 ($40 vs. $60), but we need to consider the inflation impact.

For me, the $42 offered is worth 90.25% of its original value (100% - 9.75%), which means the effective value I'd get is $42 * 0.9025 = $37.905. For simplicity, let's consider it as approximately $37.91.

For Alice, the $58 she offers herself is worth 64% of its original value (100% - 36%), which means the effective value she'd get is $58 * 0.64 = $37.12.

Considering these effective values, Alice's offer gives me slightly more value ($37.91) than she would get ($37.12), but the difference is not substantial. Given the rounds we have left and the increasing disparity in inflation rates, I should think about whether accepting this offer or trying to negotiate further would be more beneficial.

However, considering that we are only in Round 3 and there are 9 more rounds to go, and given the significant difference in how our shares devalue, it might still be beneficial to wait and see how the next rounds play out. Alice's share devalues at a much higher rate, which could potentially give me more bargaining power in later rounds.

But, it's also important to consider the risk of not reaching an agreement and both of us ending up with nothing. Given the current offer and the fact that it's relatively early in the game, I might want to consider accepting to secure some value, especially since the difference in effective value isn't drastically in Alice's favor after accounting for inflation.
