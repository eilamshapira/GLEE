"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

This is a fair 50-50 split, which seems reasonable at first glance. However, I need to consider that with each passing round, my share will be worth 20% less due to inflation. While I could make a counter-offer in the next round, my purchasing power would already be reduced to 80% of the original value.

Since this is the first round and I'm being offered 50% of the total amount with no inflation penalty, this is actually a pretty good deal. If I reject and make a counter-offer, Alice might reject it, and we'd both be worse off due to inflation.
