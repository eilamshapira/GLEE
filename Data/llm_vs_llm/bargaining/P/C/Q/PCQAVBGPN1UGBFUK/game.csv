2083.0,7917.0,"Hi Bob, let's settle this now. Because waiting hurts my share by 20% per round (while your loss is only 5%), it’s best if we agree immediately. I propose that I receive $2083 and you receive $7917. This split reflects the strategic cost of delay for both of us, and I believe it’s the fair, efficient, and rational division for round 1. What do you think?",Alice,1,
