"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 2083, ""bob_gain"": 7917, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's settle this now. Because waiting hurts my share by 20% per round (while your loss is only 5%), it’s best if we agree immediately. I propose that I receive $2083 and you receive $7917. This split reflects the strategic cost of delay for both of us, and I believe it’s the fair, efficient, and rational division for round 1. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but considering the inflation rates for both of us, I think this offer is more fair. If we proceed to the next round, the amounts will be worth even less for you. Let's settle this now. 
# Alice gain: 1800 
# Bob gain: 8200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
