"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's settle this now. Because waiting hurts my share by 20% per round (while your loss is only 5%), it’s best if we agree immediately. I propose that I receive $2083 and you receive $7917. This split reflects the strategic cost of delay for both of us, and I believe it’s the fair, efficient, and rational division for round 1. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 7917 
# Alice gain: 2083 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 8200, ""alice_gain"": 1800, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but considering the inflation rates for both of us, I think this offer is more fair. If we proceed to the next round, the amounts will be worth even less for you. Let's settle this now.""}"
