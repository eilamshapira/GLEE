"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I think it's best to make an offer that considers the inflation Bob faces. Since the money is worth 10% less to Bob each round, he has an incentive to accept sooner rather than later.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering you $6,000 with $4,000 going to Bob. This is a fair offer considering the inflation Bob faces in future rounds. If we delay, the total value becomes less valuable to Bob while remaining the same for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6500 
# Bob gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
