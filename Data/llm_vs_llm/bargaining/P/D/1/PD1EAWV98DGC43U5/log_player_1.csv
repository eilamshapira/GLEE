"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer to divide the $1,000,000.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000. This is a fair split that gives both of us a substantial amount, while acknowledging that I need to consider the 10% inflation penalty if we go to another round."
