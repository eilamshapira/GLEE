"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

The current offer gives me $400,000 out of $1,000,000. While this isn't an even split, if I reject and move to the next round:
1. The money will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation
2. I can make a counter-offer, but Alice might reject it
3. Further rounds will continue to reduce the real value through inflation

$400,000 now is better than potentially getting more later but having it be worth less due to inflation. If I reject, even if I propose a 50-50 split next round, my $500,000 would be worth $475,000 in real terms.
