"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40 in my favor to account for inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $400,000 for me
2. If I reject and propose next round:
   - The money will be worth 10% less to me
   - Maximum I could get next round would be worth $900,000 Ã— 0.9 = $810,000
   - But Alice might reject that

The current offer of $400,000 is somewhat low, considering the total amount. Since the inflation only affects me and not necessarily Alice, I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-proposal in the next round, even with the 10% inflation penalty.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while acknowledging the inflation risk:

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I'm offering you a fair 45-55 split. If you reject, we'll both lose value due to inflation, so this is mutually beneficial.""}

My reasoning:
1. I'm proposing a split that gives me slightly more but is still reasonable
2. I'm emphasizing the mutual loss from inflation to encourage acceptance
3. Even with 10% inflation, this would be better than Alice's initial offer
4. It's not too greedy, which might cause Alice to reject and make me lose more to inflation"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet in the middle with a 55-45 split in my favor. Accept and we both win. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Current offer: $450,000, but worth only $450,000 * 0.81 = $364,500 to me due to 19% inflation
2. If I reject and propose next round:
   - Money will be worth 27.1% less to me (compounding 10% more)
   - Even if I proposed and got $700,000, it would be worth only $510,300 to me
   - And Alice might reject again, making me lose even more

Comparing:
- Current guaranteed value: $364,500
- Uncertain future value with significant inflation risk
- Already lost two rounds to inflation
- Alice has moved significantly from her initial position (from 60-40 to 55-45)

This is actually a reasonable offer considering the inflation impact, and continuing to negotiate would likely result in worse outcomes for me due to compounding inflation.
