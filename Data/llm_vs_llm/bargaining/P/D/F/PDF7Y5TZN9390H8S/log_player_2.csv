"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Let's split this fairly. I'm offering you 40$. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $40, keeping $60 for herself
2. If I reject, the next round will have 20% inflation for me
3. My $40 now is better than a higher number later due to inflation
4. The split isn't exactly 50-50, but it's reasonable

While I could try to negotiate for more, the inflation penalty makes it risky to reject. $40 is a decent offer considering I'll lose value in future rounds.
