26.62,73.38,"Hi Bob, I propose we settle now so you get $73.38 today. If you wait, the 5% per round loss on your money will hurt your take‐home amount. I believe this split is fair given our different discount rates. What do you say?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
25.0,75.0,"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I think a slightly higher share for me is fair given the inflation I face. Let's settle at this amount.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, I appreciate your proposal, but I believe we can arrive at a more balanced arrangement. I look forward to making my next offer in Round 3.",Alice,2,reject
32.17,67.83,"Bob, rejecting now means you'll propose in Round 4—but with further devaluation (your money will drop to 85% value then), and you’d only secure about $71.82 nominal (worth roughly $61.05 effective). To avoid that erosion, I propose you get $67.83 nominal today (worth about $61.05 to you), while I take $32.17. I believe this split reflects our respective discount factors and makes settling now the smart move. What do you say?",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
31.0,69.0,"Alice, I appreciate your calculations, but I think this split is more fair considering the inflation I'm facing. Let's settle at this amount to avoid further devaluation.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, I understand that your money is depreciating faster, but by rejecting this offer, I can make a proposal in Round 5 where I can claim a larger share without any discount for me, while you'll face an even steeper discount moving forward. In other words, waiting further really penalizes you, so I believe you’d want a better offer—and I’d like to secure a bit more for myself than $31. I’m rejecting this offer and looking forward to our Round 5 discussion.",Alice,4,reject
35.0,65.0,"Bob, we're now in round 5, and your money is worth only about 81.45% of its face value compared to round 1. If you wait, your effective dollars will drop even further. With this offer, you get $65 nominal, which is effectively about $65 × 0.8145 ≈ $53 in today's terms. I believe this split fairly reflects the impact of inflation on your share while avoiding further losses. Let's settle now before things depreciate any more.",Alice,5,
