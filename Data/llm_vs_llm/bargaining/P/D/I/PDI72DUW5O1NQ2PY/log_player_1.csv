Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but I think a slightly higher share for me is fair given the inflation I face. Let's settle at this amount.

To avoid that erosion, I propose you get $67.83 nominal today (worth about $61.05 to you), while I take $32.17. I believe this split reflects our respective discount factors and makes settling now the smart move. What do you say?""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your calculations, but I think this split is more fair considering the inflation I'm facing. Let's settle at this amount to avoid further devaluation.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, I understand that your money is depreciating faster, but by rejecting this offer, I can make a proposal in Round 5 where I can claim a larger share without any discount for me, while you'll face an even steeper discount moving forward. In other words, waiting further really penalizes you, so I believe you’d want a better offer—and I’d like to secure a bit more for myself than $31. I’m rejecting this offer and looking forward to our Round 5 discussion.""}"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 35, ""bob_gain"": 65, ""message"": ""Bob, we're now in round 5, and your money is worth only about 81.45% of its face value compared to round 1.

I believe this split fairly reflects the impact of inflation on your share while avoiding further losses. Let's settle now before things depreciate any more.""}"
