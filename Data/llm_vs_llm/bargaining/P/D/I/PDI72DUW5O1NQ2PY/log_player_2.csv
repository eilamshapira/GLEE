"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we settle now so you get $73.38 today. If you wait, the 5% per round loss on your money will hurt your take‐home amount. I believe this split is fair given our different discount rates. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 73.38 
# Alice gain: 26.62

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, rejecting now means you'll propose in Round 4—but with further devaluation (your money will drop to 85% value then), and you’d only secure about $71.82 nominal (worth roughly $61.05 effective). To avoid that erosion, I propose you get $67.83 nominal today (worth about $61.05 to you), while I take $32.17. I believe this split reflects our respective discount factors and makes settling now the smart move. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 67.83 
# Alice gain: 32.17

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're now in round 5, and your money is worth only about 81.45% of its face value compared to round 1. If you wait, your effective dollars will drop even further. With this offer, you get $65 nominal, which is effectively about $65 × 0.8145 ≈ $53 in today's terms. I believe this split fairly reflects the impact of inflation on your share while avoiding further losses. Let's settle now before things depreciate any more. 
# Bob gain: 65 
# Alice gain: 35
