"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'm going to start with a fair offer, but one that gives me slightly more considering the inflation will affect me in future rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose a 55%-45% split in our favor. Given the 10% inflation penalty I'll face if we delay, I think this is a reasonable starting offer that gives us both a substantial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I see that Bob and I have different perspectives on what's fair. Let me propose a slightly more balanced split that accounts for the mounting inflation pressure I'm facing.

{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000}

I'm proposing a 52%-48% split. The money is already worth 20% less to me due to inflation, so I'm trying to find a compromise that works for both of us before the value erodes further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
