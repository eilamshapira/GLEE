"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, 50-50 split. What do you say, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
1. It's a 50-50 split, which is generally considered fair
2. This is the first round, and I have no inflation penalty
3. Rejecting would mean I need to make a counter-offer, but there's no guarantee Alice would accept a more favorable split
4. Getting $50 right now is a solid outcome
