Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's adjust this slightly. I'm aiming for a fair split, still. How about this? 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm rejecting this offer. While it seems like a reasonable adjustment, it's important to consider a few things:

* **Inflation:** While my buying power remains the same, Alice's is diminishing. This means a 55/45 split in this round is actually more beneficial to me than it appears at face value.
* **Time Pressure:**  We're only on round 3 of 12.  There's room for negotiation, and Alice may be more willing to concede as the rounds progress and the inflation on her end increases. 
* **Establishing a Baseline:** By rejecting this offer, I'm signaling to Alice that I'm aiming for a more equitable split, especially considering the impact of inflation."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, let's meet in the middle. Considering the impact of inflation on your end, this split ensures we both benefit fairly.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Alright Bob, considering the time, and to reach a deal, I propose an even split. Let's end this and secure our share. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a good outcome for me. While I might have been able to negotiate a slightly larger share in later rounds, accepting now ensures:

* **A Guaranteed Win:** Waiting any longer risks Alice lowering her offer, and potentially reaching a point where we both lose.
* **Favorable Split Due to Inflation:**  The 50/50 split, while seemingly equal, is actually in my favor due to the significant inflation Alice is experiencing. 

Overall, accepting this offer guarantees a fair and beneficial outcome given the circumstances."
