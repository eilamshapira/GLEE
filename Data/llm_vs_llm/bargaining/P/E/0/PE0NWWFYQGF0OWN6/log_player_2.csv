"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. It's a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
2. However, if I reject, I can make my own offer next round
3. The money will be worth 20% less for me next round, but only 5% less for Alice
4. This means waiting is more costly for me than for her
5. Given the high inflation rate for my side, this fair initial offer is actually quite good
