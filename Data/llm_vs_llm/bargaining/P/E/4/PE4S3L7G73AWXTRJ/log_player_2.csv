"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer gives me $400,000 and Alice $600,000
2. If I reject, we move to the next round where:
   - I can make an offer
   - My money will be worth 5% less
   - Alice's money will be worth 10% less
3. Since Alice's inflation rate is higher (10% vs my 5%), I have some leverage in negotiations
4. 400k/1M = 40% of the total, which isn't terrible but I could potentially do better

Given that I have the advantage of a lower inflation rate and can make the next offer, I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll make a strategic counter-offer. Given that:

1. Alice faces higher inflation (10% per round) than I do (5% per round)
2. Alice showed willingness to make a somewhat fair split in the first round
3. I want to make an offer attractive enough to accept but better for me

I'll propose a split slightly in my favor, but not so extreme that Alice would definitely reject:

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

This offer gives me a majority share while still leaving Alice with a substantial amount. Given her higher inflation rate, she might prefer accepting this now rather than risking further devaluation of her share."
