"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically. 

Alice has offered a 50-50 split, which is generally considered fair. However, if I reject this now:
1. The money will be worth 20% less for me in the next round (effectively making $100 worth $80)
2. I'll get to make the next proposal
3. I don't know how inflation affects Alice

Given that:
- A 50-50 split is fair
- Rejecting would immediately reduce my potential maximum gain by 20%
- There's no guarantee I could get a better deal in future rounds
- Delaying risks further inflation losses
- We could end up with nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds

I should accept this fair offer now rather than risk getting less due to inflation.
