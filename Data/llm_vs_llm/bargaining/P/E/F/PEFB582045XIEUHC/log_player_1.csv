"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer and there's inflation risk.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

This is a reasonable first offer that gives Bob a significant portion while protecting my interests against potential inflation if negotiations continue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The offer is lower than my initial proposal, and with 5% inflation affecting my share, I would effectively get only 4,275$ in round 1 value. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that my gains are now worth 10% less than in round 1 due to compounding inflation, I need to adjust my offer accordingly to maintain similar real value.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm increasing my nominal share to compensate for the inflation effect while still leaving Bob with a substantial portion. This offer would give me effectively around 5,400$ in round 1 value terms, which is close to my initial proposal's real value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

With 14.26% inflation, the 5000$ offered to me would be worth only about 4,287$ in round 1 value terms. This is still lower than what I would have gotten from my initial offer, and we're losing value with each round. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round to try to reach a fair agreement that accounts for my inflation disadvantage."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With my gains now worth about 19% less than round 1 due to compounding inflation, I need to propose an offer that compensates for this disadvantage while still being potentially acceptable to Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 6200, ""bob_gain"": 3800}

This offer would give me effectively about 5,022$ in round 1 value terms (6200 * 0.81), which is reasonable considering the inflation impact. I'm hoping Bob will understand that I need a larger nominal amount to offset my inflation penalty while still leaving him with a significant share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

With 22.62% inflation, the 4800$ offered to me would be worth only about 3,714$ in round 1 value terms (4800 * 0.7738). This is significantly lower than what would be fair, especially considering Bob's portion maintains its full value. We're now halfway through our rounds, and while I want to reach an agreement, this offer doesn't adequately account for my inflation disadvantage."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With my gains now worth about 26.5% less than round 1 due to compounding inflation, I need to make a strategic offer that both compensates for my significant inflation disadvantage while being more appealing to Bob to avoid further rounds of value loss.

{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500}

This offer would give me effectively about 4,777$ in round 1 value terms (6500 * 0.735), which is more reasonable given my inflation penalty. The stakes are getting higher as we've used more than half our rounds, so I'm hoping Bob will recognize this as a fair adjustment for the inflation impact I'm experiencing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

With 30.17% inflation, the 5000$ offered to me would be worth only about 3,491$ in round 1 value terms (5000 * 0.6983). This is still too low considering Bob's 5000$ maintains its full value. We're now in round 8 of 12, and while the pressure to reach an agreement is increasing, this even split in nominal terms actually represents a significant disadvantage to me due to inflation. I'll make another counter-offer to try to reach a fair agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With only 4 rounds left and my gains now worth about 33.66% less than round 1 due to compounding inflation, I need to make a more compromising offer while still protecting myself from the severe inflation impact.

{""alice_gain"": 6800, ""bob_gain"": 3200}

This offer would give me effectively about 4,511$ in round 1 value terms (6800 * 0.6634), which is getting closer to Bob's previous offers in real terms. With time running out and the risk of getting nothing becoming more real, I'm hoping Bob will recognize this as a fair adjustment that accounts for my significant inflation penalty while still giving him a substantial amount that maintains its full value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While 5200$ with 36.98% inflation means I'll effectively get about 3,277$ in round 1 value terms (5200 * 0.6302), we're now in round 10 of 12. The risk of getting nothing is becoming too high, and with only two rounds left, my negotiating position is weakening. Further rounds would only decrease my real gains due to inflation, and we might risk losing everything if we don't reach an agreement. It's better to secure this amount now than risk getting nothing or an even worse deal in the final rounds."
