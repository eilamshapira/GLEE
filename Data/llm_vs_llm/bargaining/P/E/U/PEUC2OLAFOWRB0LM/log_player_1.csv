"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my money is worth less now. Let's calculate the effective value:

*   Round 1 Alice's gain was worth $600,000.
*   Round 2 Alice's gains are worth 20% less so the $500,000 is worth $500,000 * (1 - 0.20) = $400,000 in terms of the first round value.

Since I would be getting $400,000 worth of the original value, it's better to take it now.
