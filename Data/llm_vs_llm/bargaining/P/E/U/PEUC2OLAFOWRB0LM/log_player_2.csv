"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing I get $400,000 while she takes $600,000 of the $1,000,000. 

While the division isn't equal, $400,000 is still a substantial amount. The instructions mention inflation doesn't affect me (0%), but I don't know how it affects Alice. If I reject this offer, I can make my own proposal next round, but Alice might also reject my proposal if I ask for too much.

Since there's no penalty for me to continue to the next round due to 0% inflation on my side, and I could potentially get a better deal by making a counter-offer, I'll reject this initial offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more balanced division that still acknowledges Alice's aggressive first offer.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing an equal split of the money. This is fair to both of us and represents a reasonable middle ground. Since inflation doesn't affect me, I can afford to be patient, but I also want to propose something Alice would reasonably accept rather than having this negotiation drag on."
