"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to make an offer to Bob, keeping in mind the decreasing value of the money for me. I want to secure a reasonable amount early on.

Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a decent amount. I'm keeping $60 for myself. I think this is a reasonable starting point that Bob might accept, and it gives me a good chunk of the initial value."
