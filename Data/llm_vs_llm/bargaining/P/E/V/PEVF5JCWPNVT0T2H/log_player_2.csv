"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

The offer gives me $40, while Alice takes $60. If I reject, we move to the next round where I can make a counter-offer, but the money will be worth 20% less to me. So in the next round, $100 would only be worth $80 to me.

$40 right now is better than getting a larger share of a depreciated amount in the next round. Even if I proposed a 60/40 split in my favor next round, 60% of $80 (due to inflation) would only be $48, and Alice might reject that anyway.

Given the inflation penalty and the risk of further negotiations, this is actually a reasonable first offer.
