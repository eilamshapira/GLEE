833333.0,166667.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing this split because of the inflation factor. Since money loses 20% value for you each round, if you reject and we go to the next round, the $1M will only be worth $800K to you. This offer gives you $166667 now, which is more than you'd get with an even split in the next round ($400K). It's in both our interests to finish this now.",Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,"Hi Alice, I understand we both want to finish this quickly. While inflation does affect me, your previous offer was too unbalanced. This split gives you a fair 40% of the money without any inflation risk, which is much better than you would get in a standard ultimatum game. I think this is a reasonable compromise that benefits us both and avoids further rounds.",Bob,2,

650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, let's be realistic about the inflation impact. If we go to round 4, the $1M will be worth only 64% of the original value to you due to compounding 20% inflation. My offer gives you $350K now, which is more than you'd effectively get from rejecting and making another offer. This is a fair compromise considering the declining value you face with each round.",Alice,3,
