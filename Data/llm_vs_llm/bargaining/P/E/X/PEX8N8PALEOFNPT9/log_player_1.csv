"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a proposal that considers the inflation dynamics for both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 833333,
""bob_gain"": 166667,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing this split because of the inflation factor. Since money loses 20% value for you each round, if you reject and we go to the next round, the $1M will only be worth $800K to you. This offer gives you $166,667 now, which is more than you'd get with an even split in the next round ($400K). It's in both our interests to finish this now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand we both want to finish this quickly. While inflation does affect me, your previous offer was too unbalanced. This split gives you a fair 40% of the money without any inflation risk, which is much better than you would get in a standard ultimatum game. I think this is a reasonable compromise that benefits us both and avoids further rounds. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic about the inflation impact. If we go to round 4, the $1M will be worth only 64% of the original value to you due to compounding 20% inflation. My offer gives you $350K now, which is more than you'd effectively get from rejecting and making another offer. This is a fair compromise considering the declining value you face with each round.""}"
