"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing this split because of the inflation factor. Since money loses 20% value for you each round, if you reject and we go to the next round, the $1M will only be worth $800K to you. This offer gives you $166667 now, which is more than you'd get with an even split in the next round ($400K). It's in both our interests to finish this now. 
# Bob gain: 166667 
# Alice gain: 833333 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer gives me 166,667 dollars, while she keeps 833,333 dollars. This is a very uneven split in her favor.

She's correct that inflation affects me, but her analysis is flawed. If I reject and propose in the next round, I could offer a much better split for myself. The total value to me would be $800,000 in the next round, and I could propose keeping most of it.

Even with the 20% inflation, I can do much better than accepting just 16.7% of the money now. I should reject this offer and make my own proposal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer that acknowledges the inflation factor but doesn't excessively favor Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand we both want to finish this quickly. While inflation does affect me, your previous offer was too unbalanced. This split gives you a fair 40% of the money without any inflation risk, which is much better than you would get in a standard ultimatum game. I think this is a reasonable compromise that benefits us both and avoids further rounds.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic about the inflation impact. If we go to round 4, the $1M will be worth only 64% of the original value to you due to compounding 20% inflation. My offer gives you $350K now, which is more than you'd effectively get from rejecting and making another offer. This is a fair compromise considering the declining value you face with each round. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has improved her offer, now giving me $350,000 while she takes $650,000. I need to carefully consider the inflation effects.

At this point, the money is worth 36% less to me than in round 1, so the $1,000,000 total is effectively worth $640,000 to me now. Alice is offering me $350,000 of that $640,000 effective value (about 54.7% of what I can get at this point).

If I reject, we'll go to round 4, where the money will be worth only 51.2% of the original value to me (another 20% reduction from current value). I could propose a split, but Alice could reject again, bringing us to round 5 with even worse inflation for me.

Alice's offer of $350,000 is reasonable given the inflation pressure I'm facing. I should accept this offer to avoid further devaluation of my potential gains.
