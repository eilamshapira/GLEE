"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 53 
# Alice gain: 47 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $53, which is slightly more than half of the $100. This seems like a reasonable offer, especially since I know that inflation affects Alice more than me (5% per round for her, 0% for me). 

If I reject, I'll be able to make a counter-offer next round, but Alice might be less willing to accept a much higher offer knowing that her money loses value each round.

Given that this is a fair initial offer that gives me more than half, and considering the inflation dynamics, I'll accept.
