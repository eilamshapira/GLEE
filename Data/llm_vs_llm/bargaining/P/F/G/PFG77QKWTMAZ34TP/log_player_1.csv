"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me make a strategic first offer. Given that inflation will affect me more severely (20% vs 5% for Bob), I should aim for a favorable initial split.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is still a fair offer considering Bob gets a substantial amount, and if he rejects it, the total value will decrease more significantly for me than for him in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Original value of $4500 for me, but with 20% inflation = $3600 effective value
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 3:
   * Money will be worth 40% less for me
   * Money will be worth 10% less for Bob
   * Maximum I could reasonably get would be ~$6000, but with 40% inflation = $3600

Since rejecting wouldn't likely get me a better outcome (due to the harsh inflation penalty for me), and might actually result in worse outcomes if negotiations continue:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
