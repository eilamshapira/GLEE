"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: I get $4000, Alice gets $6000
2. If I reject and propose next round:
   * The money will be worth 5% less for me
   * For Alice, it will be worth 20% less
   * This gives me negotiating leverage, as she'll be more eager to accept
3. The current split (40/60) isn't terrible, but given Alice's higher inflation rate, I can likely get a better deal by rejecting

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that Alice faces a higher inflation rate (20% vs my 5%), I'll propose a split more in my favor, but still reasonable enough that she should accept rather than risk another round where her money loses significant value.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I propose a 55/45 split in my favor, considering that if Alice rejects this, her next round value will be significantly diminished by her 20% inflation rate."
