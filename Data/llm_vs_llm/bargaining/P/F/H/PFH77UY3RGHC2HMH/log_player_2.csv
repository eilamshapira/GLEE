"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects a good balance. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
- Alice is offering me $40 while keeping $60
- If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
- However, due to 5% inflation, any amount I get next round will be worth 5% less to me
- If I get even $50 next round, it would be worth $47.50 to me due to inflation
- $40 now is better than a risky higher amount that's worth less later
