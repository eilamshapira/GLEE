"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, considering that my share loses 10% value each round and yours loses 20%, a 55/45 split seems more fair to me. Let's settle this quickly to minimize our losses. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
