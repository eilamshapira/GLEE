"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I know I'm losing more to inflation, but a 65/35 split seems reasonable for a quick agreement. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, considering that my share loses 10% value each round and yours loses 20%, a 55/45 split seems more fair to me. Let's settle this quickly to minimize our losses."" }"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but it still undervalues my losses. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers with 58/42. This minimizes both our risks.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
