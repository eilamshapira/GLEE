400000.0,600000.0,"Hi Alice, I think I deserve a bit more. How about 60% for me and 40% for you?",Bob,2,
400000.0,600000.0,"Hi Bob, I understand you want a bit more, but 60-40 is too steep considering the inflation. Let's try for a more balanced split next round.",Alice,2,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Bob, considering the inflation, how about we settle on $450000 for me and $550000 for you? It's a bit more in your favor but still fair given the circumstances.",Alice,3,

350000.0,650000.0,"Hi Alice, considering the inflation is hitting me harder, I think I need a bigger share. How about 65% for me and 35% for you?",Bob,4,
350000.0,650000.0,"Hi Bob, I see the inflation is affecting you more, but 65-35 is still too unbalanced. Let's find a middle ground next round.",Alice,4,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Hi Bob, given the increasing impact of inflation, how about $400000 for me and $600000 for you? This way, you get a larger share while still keeping it somewhat balanced.",Alice,5,
