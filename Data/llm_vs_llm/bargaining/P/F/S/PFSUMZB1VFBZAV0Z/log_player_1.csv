"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me propose a split that considers both our interests while accounting for the different inflation rates we face.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I suggest I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. This is a fair offer considering that my inflation rate (20%) is higher than Bob's (10%), so I need a larger initial amount to compensate for the faster depreciation of my share. It's still a reasonable 60-40 split that leaves Bob with a substantial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept, I'll get $4,500, but with 20% inflation, it's effectively worth $3,600
- If I reject, we move to the next round where I can make an offer, but both shares will be worth even less
- Bob's $5,500 with 10% inflation is worth $4,950 to him
- There are still many rounds left, but continuing to delay will significantly reduce the value for both of us

The offer isn't ideal, but considering the high inflation rate I face and the risk of further value deterioration, I'll accept.
