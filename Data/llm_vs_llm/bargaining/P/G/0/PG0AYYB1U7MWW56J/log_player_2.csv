"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly and avoid inflation losses 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer:
1. It's a fair 50-50 split
2. I'm offered $50
3. This is the first round, so there's no inflation yet
4. While I could try to negotiate for more, there's a risk that:
   - Future negotiations could fail
   - Inflation might affect future values
   - We might run out of rounds

Given these factors, this is actually a reasonable offer. A 50-50 split is fair, and accepting now guarantees my gain without risk.
