"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to divide the $10,000 with Bob, keeping in mind that delays will cost me 20% per round while costing Bob nothing.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a fair 50-50 split. Since delay hurts me more than you (I lose 20% value each round while you lose nothing), accepting now is the most equitable outcome for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer was quite generous, but time is on my side.  Let's make this deal happen: 6000 for me, and 4000 for you. This offer won't be on the table forever. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 4800, 
""bob_gain"": 5200, 
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're leveraging your time advantage, but let's find a more balanced deal. This split acknowledges your stronger position while still being fair to me. If we continue negotiating, I'll lose more value due to my 20% inflation penalty, and you might end up with less than this offer. Let's conclude this deal now for our mutual benefit.""}"
