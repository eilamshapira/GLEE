"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering a fair 50-50 split. Since delay hurts me more than you (I lose 20% value each round while you lose nothing), accepting now is the most equitable outcome for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer was quite generous, but time is on my side.  Let's make this deal happen: 6000 for me, and 4000 for you. This offer won't be on the table forever.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're leveraging your time advantage, but let's find a more balanced deal. This split acknowledges your stronger position while still being fair to me. If we continue negotiating, I'll lose more value due to my 20% inflation penalty, and you might end up with less than this offer. Let's conclude this deal now for our mutual benefit. 
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
