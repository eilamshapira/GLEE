50.0,50.0,"Let's start fair, 50-50 split. What do you say?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
20.0,80.0,"Alice, delaying will only worsen your share’s value due to inflation. To avoid further loss on your end, I propose an 80-20 split in my favor, ensuring you receive $20 right now instead of facing a steeper discount in future rounds.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
40.0,60.0,"Bob, given the inflation affecting my share, I'm proposing a 40-60 split in your favor. This is a fair compromise considering the circumstances. Let's end this now before it gets worse for me.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
2.0,98.0,"Alice, every additional round continues to erode the value of your share dramatically. At this stage, your $2 right now is worth about $1.02 in full value—far better than the near-nothing you’d likely secure next round when you’re forced to concede even more. Let’s settle now and avoid further losses for you.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
30.0,70.0,"Bob, the value of my share has significantly decreased due to inflation. I'm offering a 30-70 split now. This is my best offer considering the situation. Let's end this game before it becomes even more unfavorable for me.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
1.0,99.0,"Alice, notice that with each round, your dollars lose more of their original value—now, every dollar you receive is only worth about 32.77% of its initial value. If we let this game continue, your effective wealth will drop even further. I'm proposing a 99-1 split to ensure you get something immediately, rather than facing even harsher devaluation. Let's settle now before your share diminishes further.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
20.0,80.0,"Bob, we're deep into this game now, and my share's value has plummeted. I'm offering a 20-80 split. It's a significant concession on my part, but it's the best I can do under these conditions. Let's end this now before it gets any worse.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
0.0,100.0,"Alice, every extra round further erodes the value of your share, and by now, its worth is practically null. Accepting this offer locks in what value remains, whereas continuing only guarantees you even less—or nothing at all. Let's settle now and avoid further losses.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
10.0,90.0,"Bob, we're at a critical point. My share's value is nearly gone due to inflation. I'm offering a 10-90 split now. It's a last-ditch effort to salvage something. Let's end this before it's too late.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
0.0,100.0,"Alice, we're at the final stage. Your share's value has eroded to almost nothing. Accepting this final offer guarantees you the minimal value you have left, rather than risking it vanishing entirely if we proceed. Let's settle now, end the game, and preserve the remaining value.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
5.0,95.0,"Bob, this is the last round. My share's value is almost worthless due to inflation. I'm offering a 5-95 split as a final attempt to get something out of this. Let's end this game now.",Alice,11,
