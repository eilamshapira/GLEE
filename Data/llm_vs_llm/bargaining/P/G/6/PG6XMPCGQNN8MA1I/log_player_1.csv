Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, delaying will only worsen your share’s value due to inflation. To avoid further loss on your end, I propose an 80-20 split in my favor, ensuring you receive $20 right now instead of facing a steeper discount in future rounds.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every additional round continues to erode the value of your share dramatically.

Let’s settle now and avoid further losses for you.

If we let this game continue, your effective wealth will drop even further. I'm proposing a 99-1 split to ensure you get something immediately, rather than facing even harsher devaluation. Let's settle now before your share diminishes further.
