"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair is fair! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to think about this carefully. Alice is offering an even split of $5000 each. However, I need to consider the inflation factor - each round decreases the value by 10% for me, while Alice faces no inflation penalty.

If I reject and propose in round 2, I'd face 10% inflation, so any amount would be worth 10% less to me. That means if I want to secure the same effective value as this $5000 offer, I'd need to get $5556 in round 2 ($5556 Ã— 0.9 = $5000).

Given that Alice has no inflation penalty and we have 12 rounds total, rejecting could lead to a back-and-forth that ultimately hurts me more due to the asymmetric inflation.

The even split is reasonable, and avoiding inflation is valuable to me.
