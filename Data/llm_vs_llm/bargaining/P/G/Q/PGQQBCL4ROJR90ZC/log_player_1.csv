"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me propose a fair split while considering the 5% inflation risk for each round.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because it's slightly in my favor but still quite fair to Bob. If he rejects it, we'll move to the next round where the total value will be worth 5% less to me, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. This offer gives Bob a substantial portion while protecting my interests against potential inflation losses."
