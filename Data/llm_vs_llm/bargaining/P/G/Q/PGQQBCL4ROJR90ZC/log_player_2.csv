"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. The offer is $450,000 for me and $550,000 for Alice
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 20% inflation, any money I get next round will be worth 20% less
4. If I reject, my $450,000 would effectively become worth $360,000 in the next round
5. This means I would need to secure at least $562,500 in the next round to match the current offer's value
6. That might be difficult to achieve since Alice would have to accept my offer

The current offer, while not a 50-50 split, is still quite substantial and avoids the inflation penalty.
