6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor as I'm initiating the first offer. This is a fair deal considering we both need to reach an agreement.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Hi Alice, thanks for your initial offer.  I think we can find something more agreeable to both of us. How about a 55/45 split in my favor?",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, considering the 10% inflation affecting your gains each round, this 55-45 split in my favor is actually quite fair for both of us. Your $4500 now is worth more than a higher amount in later rounds.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4800.0,5200.0,"Alice, let's try to find a compromise. How about a 52/48 split in my favor?  It's a smaller gain for me than my previous offer, acknowledging the inflation, but still a better deal than what you've proposed.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, let's be practical. Due to the increasing inflation affecting your gains (now at 27.1%), this 52-48 split in my favor is actually the most rational choice. Your $4800 now is significantly more valuable than waiting for future rounds where inflation will continue to reduce your real gains.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, this back and forth isn't benefiting either of us.  Let's stop wasting time and go with a clean, fair 50/50 split.  We both get a reasonable amount, and we avoid further losses from inflation.",Bob,6,
