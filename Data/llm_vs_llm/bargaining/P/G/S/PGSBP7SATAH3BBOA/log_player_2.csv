"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor as I'm initiating the first offer. This is a fair deal considering we both need to reach an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your initial offer.  I think we can find something more agreeable to both of us. How about a 55/45 split in my favor?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering the 10% inflation affecting your gains each round, this 55-45 split in my favor is actually quite fair for both of us. Your $4500 now is worth more than a higher amount in later rounds. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

I understand Alice's point about the inflation, but her offer is still not as good for me as her initial offer.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see some movement on her part."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Alice, let's try to find a compromise. How about a 52/48 split in my favor?  It's a smaller gain for me than my previous offer, acknowledging the inflation, but still a better deal than what you've proposed.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical. Due to the increasing inflation affecting your gains (now at 27.1%), this 52-48 split in my favor is actually the most rational choice. Your $4800 now is significantly more valuable than waiting for future rounds where inflation will continue to reduce your real gains. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is using the inflation factor to her advantage, but her offer is still worse than her initial 60/40 proposal! I need to hold firm and emphasize the diminishing overall value to both of us if we wait too long."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, this back and forth isn't benefiting either of us.  Let's stop wasting time and go with a clean, fair 50/50 split.  We both get a reasonable amount, and we avoid further losses from inflation.""}"
