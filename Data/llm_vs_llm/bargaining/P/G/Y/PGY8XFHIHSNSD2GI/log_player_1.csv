"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this.

*   **My perspective (Alice):** Due to the inflation, the value of the money has decreased by 5%. I need to account for that when considering Bob's offer.
*   **Bob's offer:** 5000 for Alice, 5000 for Bob.

In Round 1, my offer was 6000 for me and 4000 for Bob. Now, with inflation, I'm being offered 5000. While this is less than my initial proposal, I have to consider that I had to give up the right to make the proposal. Since I do not know how the inflation affect Bob, I should accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
