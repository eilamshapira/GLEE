"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split but accounting for the fact that money will be worth less for me if we go to another round.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. This is slightly in my favor but still quite fair, and Bob should consider that if he rejects, we'll go to another round where my money will be worth 10% less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this carefully:

1. If I accept Bob's 50-50 split:
   * I get $5000, but due to 10% inflation, it's worth $4500 to me
   * Bob gets $5000 (no inflation for him)

2. If I reject and make a new offer in round 3:
   * Any money I get will be worth 20% less due to inflation
   * I'd need to get significantly more than $5000 to make up for that
   * Bob might reject again, leading to even more inflation

Given these factors, I'll accept Bob's offer. While not ideal, getting $4500 in value now is better than risking further inflation losses.
