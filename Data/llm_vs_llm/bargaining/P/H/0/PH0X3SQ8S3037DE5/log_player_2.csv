"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is taking a larger portion of the money ($5500) compared to my portion ($4500). While this isn't an even split, I should keep in mind that Alice faces a 10% inflation penalty per round, whereas I don't face any inflation.

If I reject and we go to the next round, I can make my own proposal. However, Alice would then evaluate my proposal with the money being worth 10% less to her. This gives me some negotiation leverage.

Given that I don't face any inflation penalty and can potentially negotiate a better deal in the next round, I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a counteroffer that takes into account the inflation Alice faces while still being fair enough that she's likely to accept.

Since Alice faces a 10% inflation penalty in each round, if she rejects my offer now, the total amount will be worth less to her in the next round. I can use this to propose a slightly better deal for myself than what she offered, while still giving her incentive to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an even 50-50 split of the money. This is more favorable to me than Alice's original offer, but it's fair and reasonable. If Alice rejects this, she'll face inflation in the next round, so this should be attractive enough for her to accept."
