"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer of a 40-60 split. Given that we have 12 potential rounds and I face 5% inflation per round, I need to carefully evaluate this offer.

With a 5% inflation penalty each round, waiting would reduce my purchasing power. If I reject and propose next round, even if I asked for more, my actual value would decrease. For example, if I waited and got 50, it would only be worth 47.5 to me due to inflation.

This first offer of 40 is fairly reasonable considering the inflation pressure on my side.
