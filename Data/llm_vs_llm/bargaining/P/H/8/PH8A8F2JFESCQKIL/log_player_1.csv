"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500,  
""message"": ""I suggest a fair split, with a small premium for me as the first mover. This way we both get a good amount without risking value loss from inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the 5% inflation, I propose a slightly higher share for myself. This way, we both still get a significant amount, and it's more fair given the value loss from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think this through:
1. If I reject, we go to round 3 where the money will be worth another 5% less
2. My current offer is $4750, which after 5% inflation is equivalent to $4512.50 from round 1
3. If I reject and make a new offer, Bob might reject again, leading to further value loss
4. The split Bob offers (4750/5250) is reasonably fair, and the difference isn't worth risking further inflation
