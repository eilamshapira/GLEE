71.43,28.57,"Hi Bob, based on our discount rates (10% for me and 20% for you each round), I propose that I take $71.43 and you get $28.57 from the $100. Accepting now avoids further devaluation for both of us. Looking forward to your agreement!",Alice,1,

50.0,50.0,"Alice, I understand your position, but given the devaluation rates, I think a fair split would be more beneficial for both of us in the long run. Let's settle for an equal division of $50 each.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, thanks for your offer, but I believe waiting until round 3—where I have the chance to propose—should secure me a more favorable outcome given the devaluation dynamics. I therefore choose to reject your proposal.",Alice,2,reject
33.0,67.0,"Bob, we've both seen how waiting further only erodes the value of the dollar we split. In round 3 my effective value is only 80% of the nominal, and yours is down to 60%. If you reject this offer, you'll get to propose in round 4, but your best‐case outcome will be roughly 100 dollars × 0.4 (i.e. $40 effective) when you try to claim almost the entire pie. I'm offering you $67 nominal now, which gives you an effective value of about $40.20 – a tiny improvement over your fallback – while preserving more value for both of us. Accepting now avoids further devaluation and secures a better overall deal.",Alice,3,
