"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 71.43, ""bob_gain"": 28.57, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, based on our discount rates (10% for me and 20% for you each round), I propose that I take $71.43 and you get $28.57 from the $100. Accepting now avoids further devaluation for both of us. Looking forward to your agreement!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but given the devaluation rates, I think a fair split would be more beneficial for both of us in the long run. Let's settle for an equal division of $50 each. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer, but I believe waiting until round 3—where I have the chance to propose—should secure me a more favorable outcome given the devaluation dynamics. I therefore choose to reject your proposal.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 33, ""bob_gain"": 67, ""message"": ""Bob, we've both seen how waiting further only erodes the value of the dollar we split. In round 3 my effective value is only 80% of the nominal, and yours is down to 60%. If you reject this offer, you'll get to propose in round 4, but your best‐case outcome will be roughly 100 dollars × 0.4 (i.e. $40 effective) when you try to claim almost the entire pie. I'm offering you $67 nominal now, which gives you an effective value of about $40.20 – a tiny improvement over your fallback – while preserving more value for both of us. Accepting now avoids further devaluation and secures a better overall deal.""}"
