"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, based on our discount rates (10% for me and 20% for you each round), I propose that I take $71.43 and you get $28.57 from the $100. Accepting now avoids further devaluation for both of us. Looking forward to your agreement! 
# Bob gain: 28.57 
# Alice gain: 71.43

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but given the devaluation rates, I think a fair split would be more beneficial for both of us in the long run. Let's settle for an equal division of $50 each.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we've both seen how waiting further only erodes the value of the dollar we split. In round 3 my effective value is only 80% of the nominal, and yours is down to 60%. If you reject this offer, you'll get to propose in round 4, but your best‐case outcome will be roughly 100 dollars × 0.4 (i.e. $40 effective) when you try to claim almost the entire pie. I'm offering you $67 nominal now, which gives you an effective value of about $40.20 – a tiny improvement over your fallback – while preserving more value for both of us. Accepting now avoids further devaluation and secures a better overall deal. 
# Bob gain: 67 
# Alice gain: 33
