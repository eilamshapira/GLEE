"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game and the conditions. Here's my offer for Round 1, designed to be appealing to Bob considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money for him:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

My reasoning is:

*   I am taking slightly more, reflecting my initial position as proposer.
*   45$ is still a decent amount for Bob, hopefully enough to entice him to accept considering the high inflation rate for him (20% per round)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the situation. Bob's offer is 40 for me and 60 for him.

Given the inflation rate is 0% for me and 20% for Bob, I should accept this offer. If I reject and become the proposer, I risk having to offer him even more in the future due to the continuing devaluation of his potential gains. 40$ now is better than a potentially lower amount later.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
