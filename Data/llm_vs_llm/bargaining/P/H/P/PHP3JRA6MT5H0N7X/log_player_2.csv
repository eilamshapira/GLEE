"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split, let's end this! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 60-40 split in her favor, giving me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000. 

If I reject, I can make a counteroffer in round 2, but the money will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation. Each round we delay, I lose 5% value. After 12 rounds, we both get nothing.

While a 50-50 split might seem fairer, accepting now guarantees me $400,000. If I reject, the next round's total value to me would effectively be $950,000 (5% less), and this decreases with each round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more balanced while acknowledging the time pressure we both face.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. This gives us both significant value and avoids the risk of inflation reducing our gains in future rounds. Let's cooperate for mutual benefit.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer: 58-42, meeting you halfway from my initial offer 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has improved her offer to give me $420,000 (42%) instead of the initial $400,000 (40%). I need to consider this alongside the inflation effects.

Since we're now in round 3, the money is worth 9.75% less to me. If I accept Alice's offer now, my effective gain would be approximately $379,050 (420,000 Ã— 0.9025).

If I reject and we continue to the next round, inflation will reduce the value by another 5% for me. Also interesting to note that Alice seems to be experiencing even higher inflation (19%), which may make her more motivated to reach an agreement soon.

Given the increasing inflation and the improved offer, accepting now might be more beneficial than continuing to negotiate with diminishing returns.
