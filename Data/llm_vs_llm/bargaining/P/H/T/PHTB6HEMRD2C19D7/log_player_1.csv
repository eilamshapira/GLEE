"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a strategic first offer, considering that both of us face depreciation but Bob's is more severe (20% vs 10% per round). I'll propose a split that's slightly in my favor but still attractive enough for Bob to consider accepting immediately.

{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you a fair $400,000. Consider that if you reject, the total value will decrease significantly more for you (20%) than for me (10%) in the next round. This is a solid offer that benefits us both.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the inflation, I believe this offer is more than fair. If you reject, the total value will continue to decrease, and I'm willing to take that risk. I think we can both walk away satisfied with this division. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept now:
   * I get $450,000 at 90% value = $405,000 effective value
   * Bob gets $550,000 at 80% value = $440,000 effective value

2. If I reject:
   * Next round my offer would be affected by another 10% depreciation
   * Bob's value would be affected by another 20% depreciation
   * The total pie would be worth less for both of us

Given that:
- The current offer gives me a reasonable share
- The depreciation rate is significant
- There's risk in continuing negotiation
- The effective values are fairly close between us
