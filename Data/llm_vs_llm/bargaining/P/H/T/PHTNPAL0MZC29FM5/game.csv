500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Alice, I think a 50-50 split is the fairest approach. This way we both walk away with equal amounts, and we avoid further devaluation of the total sum through additional rounds. Even with the 5% inflation we've already incurred, this is better for both of us than continuing to negotiate.",Bob,2,
