Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000,""bob_gain"": 400000,""message"": ""Let's split the money. I take 600k and you get 400k. It's a fair start!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think a 50-50 split is the fairest approach. This way we both walk away with equal amounts, and we avoid further devaluation of the total sum through additional rounds. Even with the 5% inflation we've already incurred, this is better for both of us than continuing to negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
