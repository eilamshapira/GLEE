"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money. I take 600k and you get 400k. It's a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice's offer isn't an even split, I need to consider that rejecting means we move to the next round where the total value decreases by 5%. Let me evaluate if countering would be advantageous.

If I reject, the $1,000,000 becomes worth $950,000 in the next round. I could propose a more favorable split, but we'd already be losing $50,000 in total value. Multiple rejections would further erode the total amount.

Given this is just the first round and there's significant room for improvement in my share, I'll reject this offer to propose a more balanced split.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I think a 50-50 split is the fairest approach. This way we both walk away with equal amounts, and we avoid further devaluation of the total sum through additional rounds. Even with the 5% inflation we've already incurred, this is better for both of us than continuing to negotiate.""}"
