"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me the entire $10,000
2. While this is extremely favorable to me, it's unlikely Alice would accept any counter-offer that gives her so little
3. Since Alice faces 5% depreciation per round, I have some negotiating leverage
4. However, it would be greedy and unrealistic to take everything

I'll reject this offer to propose a more reasonable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a split that's favorable to me but still gives Alice a significant portion, considering she faces 5% depreciation per round.

{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000}

This offer gives me 70% of the money while still leaving Alice with a substantial amount. Since her money depreciates each round, she might be motivated to accept this offer rather than continue negotiating. It's also a much more reasonable starting point for negotiation compared to her initial offer."
