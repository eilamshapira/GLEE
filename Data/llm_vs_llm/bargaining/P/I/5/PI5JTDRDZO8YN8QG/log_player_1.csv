"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since this is the first round and I want to avoid inflation losses, I'll make a fair but slightly advantageous offer to encourage acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose this split because it gives me a small advantage while still being reasonable enough that Bob might accept it rather than risk inflation by going to the next round."
