"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given that your money loses 20% value next round, this 3000$ now is worth more than 4000$ in the next round. This is a fair offer considering the time pressure you face. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
