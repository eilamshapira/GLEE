286000.0,714000.0,"Alice, considering that waiting further will rapidly erode our winnings—with my money decreasing by 10% and yours by 20% each round—this offer reflects the fair equilibrium split in our current round. I’m proposing I receive 714000 and you receive 286000. Accept now so we both secure our best‐possible outcomes before even more inflation bites us.",Bob,2,

600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, your last offer was simply unacceptable.  While I understand the pressure of inflation, your proposed split is wildly unfair. I'm offering you a more reasonable 400000. Let's be reasonable and end this game. ",Alice,3,

286000.0,714000.0,"Alice, every round we wait further burns our gains. If you reject this offer, you’ll get to propose in round 5—but because your money then is worth only about 40.96% of its initial value (compared to 51.2% now), your best‐case nominal outcome would be roughly $286000. That’s exactly what I’m offering you now. Accept this split and we both secure as much value as possible before inflation eats away more of our winnings.",Bob,4,
