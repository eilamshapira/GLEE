Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering that waiting further will rapidly erode our winnings—with my money decreasing by 10% and yours by 20% each round—this offer reflects the fair equilibrium split in our current round. I’m proposing I receive 714000 and you receive 286000. Accept now so we both secure our best‐possible outcomes before even more inflation bites us. 
# Alice gain: 286000 
# Bob gain: 714000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every round we wait further burns our gains. If you reject this offer, you’ll get to propose in round 5—but because your money then is worth only about 40.96% of its initial value (compared to 51.2% now), your best‐case nominal outcome would be roughly $286000. That’s exactly what I’m offering you now. Accept this split and we both secure as much value as possible before inflation eats away more of our winnings.

# Bob gain: 714000
