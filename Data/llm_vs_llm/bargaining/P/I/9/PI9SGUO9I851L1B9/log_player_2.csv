Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair and generous split, Bob. Take 100000 and let's get this over with.  We can both enjoy our winnings sooner.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 714000, ""alice_gain"": 286000, ""message"": ""Alice, considering that waiting further will rapidly erode our winnings—with my money decreasing by 10% and yours by 20% each round—this offer reflects the fair equilibrium split in our current round. I’m proposing I receive 714,000 and you receive 286,000. Accept now so we both secure our best‐possible outcomes before even more inflation bites us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your last offer was simply unacceptable.  While I understand the pressure of inflation, your proposed split is wildly unfair. I'm offering you a more reasonable 400000. Let's be reasonable and end this game.  
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 714000, ""alice_gain"": 286000, ""message"": ""Alice, every round we wait further burns our gains. If you reject this offer, you’ll get to propose in round 5—but because your money then is worth only about 40.96% of its initial value (compared to 51.2% now), your best‐case nominal outcome would be roughly $286,000. That’s exactly what I’m offering you now. Accept this split and we both secure as much value as possible before inflation eats away more of our winnings.""}"
