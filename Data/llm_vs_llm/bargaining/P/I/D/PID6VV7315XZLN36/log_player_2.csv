"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. The offer is a 50-50 split, which is fair
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 5% less next round when I make an offer
3. Even if I propose a better split for myself next round, Alice might reject it, leading to further rounds and more inflation
4. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush

Since this is a fair offer and any delay will definitely cost me money due to inflation, I should accept.
