"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split where I get slightly more as a first-mover. This way we both walk away with a substantial amount without risking inflation losses.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it equally. This way, we both get a good amount, and we can avoid the effects of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The reasoning is:
1. If I reject, any future gains will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation
2. A 500,000$ offer now is worth more than a potentially higher offer in future rounds
3. It's a fair 50-50 split
4. There's no guarantee Bob will accept a better offer from me in the next round
5. The risk of continuing and potentially getting nothing after 12 rounds is not worth it

Therefore, accepting this fair offer in an early round is the most rational choice."
