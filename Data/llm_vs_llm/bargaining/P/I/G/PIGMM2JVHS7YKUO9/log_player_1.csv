"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob, considering the inflation issue.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm suggesting a fair split that accounts for the inflation penalty I face. If we go to another round, the total value decreases for me, so this is beneficial for both of us to agree now.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since the money's value decreases for you each round, I propose an equal split now. This way, you still get a fair share despite the inflation, and we can end the game amicably. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
