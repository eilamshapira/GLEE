"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a fair first offer, considering that Bob has more to lose from delays due to higher inflation impact (20% vs 5%).

{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I suggest a slightly higher split for me as the first mover, but it's fair considering you lose more value from delays. Let's make a deal now and both benefit.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Here's a fairer split considering the inflation differences. Accepting this now prevents further loss for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $4800 at 95% value = $4560 effective value
- If I reject and make a new offer next round:
  - Total value decreases further (90% for me, 60% for Bob)
  - Bob would be even less likely to accept a higher split
  - We both lose more value

Given that Bob's offer is reasonable and further delays would significantly reduce the pie for both of us, I'll accept.
