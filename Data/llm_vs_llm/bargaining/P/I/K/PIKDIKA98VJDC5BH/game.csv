5500.0,4500.0,I propose we split the money with me getting 5500 and you getting 4500. This is a fair start considering the inflation risk.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
5000.0,5000.0,Let's split the money evenly. A fair and straightforward approach.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5400.0,4600.0,Let's compromise. I'll take 5400 and you take 4600. This way we both get a bit more than an even split.,Alice,3,
