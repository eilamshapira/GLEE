"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for round 2, considering the inflation:

The original $10,000 is now worth less. For me (Bob), the value is reduced by 20% per round, and for Alice by 10%.

Since this is round 2, the effective amount is:

*   **For Bob:** 10,000 * (1 - 0.20)^1 = $8,000
*   **For Alice:** 10,000 * (1 - 0.10)^1 = $9,000

I will use the original amount for the offer, however.

Here's my offer:
```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""alice_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for round 4, accounting for the inflation:

*   **For Bob:** The original $10,000 is now worth 10,000 * (1 - 0.20)^3 = $5,120
*   **For Alice:** The original $10,000 is now worth 10,000 * (1 - 0.10)^3 = $7,290

I'll base my offer on the original amount:

```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""alice_gain"": 4000
}
```"
