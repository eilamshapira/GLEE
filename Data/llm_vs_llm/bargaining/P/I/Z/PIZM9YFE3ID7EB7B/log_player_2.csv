"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering I'm taking the initiative in the first round. This gives you a solid $4000 right now without risking inflation losses. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The current offer gives me $4,000
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
   * The money will be worth 20% less to me
   * Maximum I could get in next round would be $8,000, but worth only $6,400 due to inflation
   * And Alice might reject that anyway

The offer is not great, but:
- It's a reasonable first offer
- The inflation penalty makes waiting risky
- $4,000 now is better than potentially less later
- Alice might be more aggressive in later rounds
