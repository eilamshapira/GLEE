500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing an even split of the $1000000: $500000 for you and $500000 for me. Since the money's value on my side drops by 5% with each round, I believe that agreeing now is in both our interests. This fair offer avoids any complications from delay, and I hope you'll agree to secure our winnings immediately.",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Alice, thanks for the initial offer.  While an even split sounds fair, I'm sure you understand the pressure of inflation on my end. To make me more comfortable with a deal now, I propose a slightly adjusted split: $550000 for me and $450000 for you. This way, we both secure a good portion of the money right away. What do you think?",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, I appreciate your proposal, but given the opportunity to make an offer in the next round—and considering my inflation rate is lower than yours—I believe there's room to reach a more favorable agreement. I'm opting to wait until round 3 to propose a division that better reflects the devaluation on both sides.",Alice,2,reject
480000.0,520000.0,"Hi Bob, considering that each subsequent round further devalues the total amount—especially on our respective sides—I propose a split of $480000 for me and $520000 for you. With this division, my share will be worth 10% less than round 1 (i.e. $432000 effective) while you would secure a nominal amount that, even if subject to a steeper inflation (potentially around 15% less), would still be more competitive than risking another round. Accepting now guarantees that both of us avoid further devaluation. I believe this is a fair and pragmatic solution; I hope you agree.",Alice,3,

470000.0,530000.0,"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. It's clear we both want to reach an agreement soon.  I'm proposing a split of $530000 for me and $470000 for you.  This takes into account the time pressure we're both under and ensures a more balanced outcome.  I believe this is a fair offer that lets us walk away with a significant amount of money.  Let's close this deal.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, thanks for your detailed offer. Taking into account the inflation differences—where my share only loses about 14.26% of its original value as opposed to your 27.1% reduction—I realize that accepting now actually gives me a comparatively better effective share in round-1 dollars. Considering the further risks of additional devaluation in future rounds, I accept your proposal of $470000 for me and $530000 for you. Let's close this deal and secure our winnings.",Alice,4,accept
