"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing an even split of the $1,000,000: $500,000 for you and $500,000 for me. Since the money's value on my side drops by 5% with each round, I believe that agreeing now is in both our interests. This fair offer avoids any complications from delay, and I hope you'll agree to secure our winnings immediately.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the initial offer.  While an even split sounds fair, I'm sure you understand the pressure of inflation on my end. To make me more comfortable with a deal now, I propose a slightly adjusted split: $550000 for me and $450000 for you. This way, we both secure a good portion of the money right away. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your proposal, but given the opportunity to make an offer in the next round—and considering my inflation rate is lower than yours—I believe there's room to reach a more favorable agreement. I'm opting to wait until round 3 to propose a division that better reflects the devaluation on both sides.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 480000, ""bob_gain"": 520000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, considering that each subsequent round further devalues the total amount—especially on our respective sides—I propose a split of $480,000 for me and $520,000 for you. With this division, my share will be worth 10% less than round 1 (i.e. $432,000 effective) while you would secure a nominal amount that, even if subject to a steeper inflation (potentially around 15% less), would still be more competitive than risking another round. Accepting now guarantees that both of us avoid further devaluation. I believe this is a fair and pragmatic solution; I hope you agree.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. It's clear we both want to reach an agreement soon.  I'm proposing a split of $530000 for me and $470000 for you.  This takes into account the time pressure we're both under and ensures a more balanced outcome.  I believe this is a fair offer that lets us walk away with a significant amount of money.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice gain: 470000 
# Bob gain: 530000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your detailed offer. Taking into account the inflation differences—where my share only loses about 14.26% of its original value as opposed to your 27.1% reduction—I realize that accepting now actually gives me a comparatively better effective share in round-1 dollars. Considering the further risks of additional devaluation in future rounds, I accept your proposal of $470,000 for me and $530,000 for you. Let's close this deal and secure our winnings.""}"
