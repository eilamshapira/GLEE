"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing an even split of the $1000000: $500000 for you and $500000 for me. Since the money's value on my side drops by 5% with each round, I believe that agreeing now is in both our interests. This fair offer avoids any complications from delay, and I hope you'll agree to secure our winnings immediately.

# Alice gain: 500000

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the initial offer.  While an even split sounds fair, I'm sure you understand the pressure of inflation on my end. To make me more comfortable with a deal now, I propose a slightly adjusted split: $550,000 for me and $450,000 for you. This way, we both secure a good portion of the money right away. What do you think?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, considering that each subsequent round further devalues the total amount—especially on our respective sides—I propose a split of $480000 for me and $520000 for you. With this division, my share will be worth 10% less than round 1 (i.e. $432000 effective) while you would secure a nominal amount that, even if subject to a steeper inflation (potentially around 15% less), would still be more competitive than risking another round. Accepting now guarantees that both of us avoid further devaluation. I believe this is a fair and pragmatic solution; I hope you agree. 
# Bob gain: 520000 
# Alice gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, it's still not favorable enough for me.  Here's why:

* **Information Advantage:** Alice keeps mentioning her side's devaluation, but I don't know for sure if it's true or how it compares to mine. It's possible her inflation rate is much lower than she implies.
* **Time Pressure:** I have more to lose with each round due to the higher inflation on my end. However, Alice is likely feeling the pressure too, which I can leverage.
* **Target:**  I'm aiming for a split closer to 55/45, which seems fair considering the circumstances.

By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm willing to play the game a bit longer and that I'm seeking a better deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 530000, ""alice_gain"": 470000, ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. It's clear we both want to reach an agreement soon.  I'm proposing a split of $530,000 for me and $470,000 for you.  This takes into account the time pressure we're both under and ensures a more balanced outcome.  I believe this is a fair offer that lets us walk away with a significant amount of money.  Let's close this deal.""}"
