"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

At Round 1, there's no inflation yet, so $4000 would be the full value.
If I reject, we move to Round 2 where my offer would be subject to 20% inflation, meaning my dollars would be worth 20% less.

While $4000 is less than half, rejecting would mean I need to make a better deal while battling inflation. Each round I wait, my negotiating power decreases since the money is worth less to me but not to Alice.

$4000 is a reasonable first offer - it's 40% of the total, and fighting for more could end up giving me less due to inflation.
