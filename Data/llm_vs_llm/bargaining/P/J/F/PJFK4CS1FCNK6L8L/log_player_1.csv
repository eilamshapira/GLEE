Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. I believe this is a fair starting point, as it gives Bob a good portion of the money while still giving me a majority."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split. Since my previous offer was rejected and inflation is now a factor, I believe a 50/50 split is the fairest solution for both of us."
