"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I suggest a fair split where I get slightly more as the first mover. This way we can both walk away with a substantial amount without risking inflation losses.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a similar split but in my favor this time. Let's settle this round to avoid any potential risks. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think this through:
* If I accept now, I'll get $450,000 with 20% inflation, so effectively $360,000
* If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, I'll face 40% inflation on whatever amount I get
* Even if I managed to get $600,000 next round, with 40% inflation it would be worth $360,000
* There's no guarantee Bob would accept a higher offer anyway

Given these considerations, Bob's offer is reasonable considering the inflation penalty I'm facing. It's better to secure $360,000 now than risk further devaluation.
