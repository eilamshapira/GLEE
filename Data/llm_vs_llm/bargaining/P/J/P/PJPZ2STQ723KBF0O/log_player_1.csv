"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's settle this now before inflation eats into my share. I'm proposing $55 for me and $45 for you. I believe this split is fair and ensures we both get a good amount without delaying further. What do you say?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns about inflation, but I believe I deserve a bit more. I'm proposing $40 for me and $60 for you. I hope this offer seems reasonable! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your proposal. Although the inflation takes a bit off my nominal share, receiving 60 dollars (which is worth 48 in round-1 value) now is still a decent deal compared to the uncertainty of later rounds. I accept your offer.""}"
