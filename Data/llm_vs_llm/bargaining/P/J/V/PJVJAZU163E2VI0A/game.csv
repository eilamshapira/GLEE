550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, let's be efficient and avoid further inflation losses. I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. This is actually better for you than your last offer since your money was suffering 20% inflation. With this split, you get 450000 now rather than letting the value decrease further. Let's conclude this deal.",Alice,3,
