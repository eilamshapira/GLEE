"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first move. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get a substantial amount without risking inflation losses.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was tempting, but let's be realistic. We both want to maximize our gains. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This ensures a good deal for me while still leaving you with a significant sum. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The value I would get is only 450,000 * 0.95 = 427,500 effective value due to inflation. I can make a better counter-offer in the next round, even accounting for further inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Bob, let's be efficient and avoid further inflation losses. I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. This is actually better for you than your last offer since your money was suffering 20% inflation. With this split, you get 450,000 now rather than letting the value decrease further. Let's conclude this deal.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the urgency of the situation with inflation affecting us both. Your offer was close, but I need a bit more assurance. I propose a 52-48 split. This recognizes the value of time while still offering you a fair share. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. With inflation at 14.26%, my effective value would be 480,000 * 0.8574 = 411,552. If I reject and continue negotiating, the increasing inflation will erode the value further, and we risk getting nothing if we reach round 12 without agreement. This is a reasonable compromise that gives me a good value considering the circumstances."
