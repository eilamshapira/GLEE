Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be efficient and avoid further inflation losses. I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. This is actually better for you than your last offer since your money was suffering 20% inflation. With this split, you get 450000 now rather than letting the value decrease further. Let's conclude this deal.
