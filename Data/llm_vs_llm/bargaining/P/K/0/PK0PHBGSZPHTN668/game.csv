900000.0,100000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $900000 and you receive $100000. Given that delaying may expose you to uncertain inflation effects while my share remains unaltered, this offer secures you a solid, immediate gain. I believe this division is mutually beneficial, so I hope you accept it now.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, with inflation hitting hard, my initial offer is now worth significantly less. I propose a fairer split: I take $600000 and you get $400000. This secures a substantial sum for both of us. Take it, and we'll both win!",Bob,2,
,,"Bob’s offer gives me $400000—quite a decent sum. However, since my money isn’t affected by inflation while Bob’s is, I have a distinct bargaining advantage. By rejecting now, I'll have the chance to propose in round 3. In that round I can design a proposal that takes into account Bob’s further devaluation and requires him only the minimal amount he’d accept compared to his continuation value. Consequently, I expect that waiting (and being the proposer next) will let me secure more than $400000 in real value. Thus, I must reject your offer.",Alice,2,reject
120000.0,880000.0,"Hi Bob, considering that your money loses 10% of its value each round while mine remain constant, waiting only hurts your eventual payoff. In round 3 your dollars are worth 80% of their face value. Therefore, if you accept this offer, you get $880000 nominally—which effectively means $704000 in round‐1 value. This is marginally better than if you were to wait and propose in round 4, when further inflation would reduce your effective amount. I believe this is a fair adjustment given the inflation penalty you face. I hope you agree and accept the offer now.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, the longer we wait, the worse it gets for me. Given inflation and your previous offers, I propose a split of $550000 for me and $450000 for you. This is a significant compromise on my part, and it's a good deal for both of us, considering the time value of money. Let's end this now and secure our gains.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, while your offer of $450000 for me and $550000 for you might seem attractive at first glance, the fact remains that my dollars retain their full value while yours continue to lose purchasing power. By rejecting this offer now, I as the proposer in Round 5 can craft a division that leverages the continued inflation penalty on your share. While you get an effective $400950 now, waiting only worsens the value of the money you'll receive. I believe I can secure a deal that gives me at least as much as I have now—if not more—while offering you just enough to make acceptance preferable to further delay. Therefore, I must reject your current offer.",Alice,4,reject
345000.0,655000.0,"Hi Bob, here's my proposal for round 5. Recall that with inflation your dollars are worth only 65.61% of their face value in this round (since 0.9^4 ≈ 0.6561). If you reject my offer, you become proposer in round 6, and in equilibrium you’d secure about $729000 nominal for yourself by offering me the minimum I’d accept in round 7—giving you an effective value of roughly 729000 × 0.9^5 (≈ 729000 × 0.59049 ≈ $430000). To match that outcome in round 5, you need a nominal amount Y such that Y × 0.6561 ≈ $430000, which comes out to about $655000. Accordingly, I propose that you receive $655000 nominal and I receive the remaining $345000. This way, you get the same effective payoff as waiting for round 6, making this offer optimal for both of us. I hope you accept this fair and time-sensitive proposal.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, we're running out of time, and my money is losing value rapidly. I propose we take a deal where I get $600000 and you get $400000. This keeps a lot of money in both of our hands, which is great for both of us. Let's get this settled.",Bob,6,
,,"Bob, I appreciate your proposal, but the $400000 you offer me in round 6 is less than what I can secure by being the proposer in round 7. Remember, your money is now worth only about 59.05% of its nominal value, and it will drop further if we delay again—down to roughly 53.14% in round 7. By waiting, I can structure an offer that targets your next best option, ensuring that you receive just enough to keep you indifferent between accepting now and waiting. This will let me capture an even larger effective share. For these reasons, I must reject your offer.",Alice,6,reject
380000.0,620000.0,"Hi Bob, here’s my proposal in Round 7. At this point, every dollar you get is worth only about 59.05% of its face value. If you choose to wait for Round 8, the effective value of your money will drop further to roughly 53.14%, meaning any nominal gain you secure then will be significantly less in real terms. Based on my calculations, by accepting $620000 now (worth about $365000 in today’s dollars) you do better than what you could expect by delaying further. In return, I would keep $380000 at full value. I believe this deal appropriately reflects the time sensitivity and inflation penalty you face, and I hope you agree to settle on this fair arrangement now.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
420000.0,580000.0,"Alice, we're in a tough spot with the money losing value. I offer $580000 for me and $420000 for you. This ensures we both keep a decent amount. Time is running out. Let's do this.",Bob,8,
,,"Bob, although your offer gives me $420000 at full value, I believe I can secure an even better outcome by waiting. In round 9, as the proposer, I can design a division that takes into account the further decline in the effective value of your money—already only about 47.83% of its nominal value in round 8 will worsen soon. I can tailor an offer that leaves you just enough to prefer accepting my proposal next round rather than risking even steeper losses. Therefore, given my strong position and the potential to improve my payoff further, I must reject your current proposal.",Alice,8,reject
999000.0,1000.0,"Bob, as we approach the final rounds, the gap between our positions becomes stark. If you reject this offer and become the proposer in Round 10, you'll be forced to concede almost everything to me in the following rounds since I continue to receive full value while your money is further devalued by inflation. In effect, waiting implies that you’ll secure virtually nothing, as I can extract nearly the entire pie in subsequent rounds. Therefore, to keep you from a zero outcome, I’m offering you a nominal $1000 now – a better deal than what you can expect by further delay. I urge you to accept this proposal and avoid the inevitable erosion of your share.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, we are close to the end and my dollars are still being devalued at a rapid rate. So, I propose this last offer, which is $550000 for me and $450000 for you. This is my final offer, and I hope you accept it to ensure that we both receive a significant amount of money!",Bob,10,
,,"Bob, I understand that you're trying to secure as much value as possible given the rapid devaluation of your dollars. However, your current offer gives me $450000—whereas if I reject and become the proposer in Round 11, I can design a split that, while leaving you something marginal to motivate your acceptance, allows me to capture almost the entire pie. In Round 11, knowing that if we reach Round 12 both walk away with nothing, you would have to accept nearly any positive amount. This means my alternative is far superior to the $450000 on offer now. For these reasons, I must reject your final proposal in Round 10.",Alice,10,reject
333333.0,666667.0,"Hi Bob, as we enter Round 11 the situation is critical. If you reject and we reach Round 12, you'd be the proposer—but by then your dollars will be devalued even further (roughly only 20% of face value), allowing you to secure at most an effective value of about $200000. Under the current conditions (where your money is worth roughly 30% of its nominal value), your reservation payoff is approximately $666667 nominal (since 0.3 × 666667 ≈ 200000). To keep you just slightly better off than that, I propose giving you $666667 nominal while I take $333333. This split ensures you receive an effective value marginally above your fallback in Round 12, while I maximize my share knowing that any further delay would almost certainly leave me with nothing. I urge you to accept this offer and avoid the further losses that additional rounds would impose on your share.",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, this is it. My final offer. Considering how much inflation has hurt my share, I am offering a 50/50 split: $500000 for me, $500000 for you. We either accept this offer now and get something, or we both walk away with nothing. What do you say?",Bob,12,
,,"Bob, I appreciate your final offer. Although your dollars have lost significant value due to inflation, I still receive my full share at face value. At this stage, walking away means we both get nothing, so a 50/50 split is far better for me than risking an outcome of zero. I accept your proposal and believe it's the most rational course of action given our constraints.",Alice,12,accept
