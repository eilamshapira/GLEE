Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, with inflation hitting hard, my initial offer is now worth significantly less. I propose a fairer split: I take $600000 and you get $400000. This secures a substantial sum for both of us. Take it, and we'll both win!

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob’s offer gives me $400,000—quite a decent sum. However, since my money isn’t affected by inflation while Bob’s is, I have a distinct bargaining advantage. By rejecting now, I'll have the chance to propose in round 3. In that round I can design a proposal that takes into account Bob’s further devaluation and requires him only the minimal amount he’d accept compared to his continuation value. Consequently, I expect that waiting (and being the proposer next) will let me secure more than $400,000 in real value. Thus, I must reject your offer.""}"

Round 3

In round 3 your dollars are worth 80% of their face value. Therefore, if you accept this offer, you get $880,000 nominally—which effectively means $704,000 in round‐1 value. This is marginally better than if you were to wait and propose in round 4, when further inflation would reduce your effective amount. I believe this is a fair adjustment given the inflation penalty you face. I hope you agree and accept the offer now.""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

This is a significant compromise on my part, and it's a good deal for both of us, considering the time value of money. Let's end this now and secure our gains.

By rejecting this offer now, I as the proposer in Round 5 can craft a division that leverages the continued inflation penalty on your share. While you get an effective $400,950 now, waiting only worsens the value of the money you'll receive. I believe I can secure a deal that gives me at least as much as I have now—if not more—while offering you just enough to make acceptance preferable to further delay. Therefore, I must reject your current offer.""}"

Round 5

Recall that with inflation your dollars are worth only 65.61% of their face value in this round (since 0.9^4 ≈ 0.6561). If you reject my offer, you become proposer in round 6, and in equilibrium you’d secure about $729,000 nominal for yourself by offering me the minimum I’d accept in round 7—giving you an effective value of roughly 729,000 × 0.9^5 (≈ 729,000 × 0.59049 ≈ $430,000). To match that outcome in round 5, you need a nominal amount Y such that Y × 0.6561 ≈ $430,000, which comes out to about $655,000. Accordingly, I propose that you receive $655,000 nominal and I receive the remaining $345,000. This way, you get the same effective payoff as waiting for round 6, making this offer optimal for both of us. I hope you accept this fair and time-sensitive proposal.""}"

By waiting, I can structure an offer that targets your next best option, ensuring that you receive just enough to keep you indifferent between accepting now and waiting.

If you choose to wait for Round 8, the effective value of your money will drop further to roughly 53.14%, meaning any nominal gain you secure then will be significantly less in real terms. Based on my calculations, by accepting $620,000 now (worth about $365,000 in today’s dollars) you do better than what you could expect by delaying further. In return, I would keep $380,000 at full value.

In effect, waiting implies that you’ll secure virtually nothing, as I can extract nearly the entire pie in subsequent rounds.

In Round 11, knowing that if we reach Round 12 both walk away with nothing, you would have to accept nearly any positive amount.
