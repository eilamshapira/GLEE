"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $900000 and you receive $100000. Given that delaying may expose you to uncertain inflation effects while my share remains unaltered, this offer secures you a solid, immediate gain. I believe this division is mutually beneficial, so I hope you accept it now.

# Alice gain: 900000

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, considering that your money loses 10% of its value each round while mine remain constant, waiting only hurts your eventual payoff. In round 3 your dollars are worth 80% of their face value. Therefore, if you accept this offer, you get $880000 nominally—which effectively means $704000 in round‐1 value. This is marginally better than if you were to wait and propose in round 4, when further inflation would reduce your effective amount. I believe this is a fair adjustment given the inflation penalty you face. I hope you agree and accept the offer now.

This is a significant compromise on my part, and it's a good deal for both of us, considering the time value of money. Let's end this now and secure our gains.""

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal for round 5. Recall that with inflation your dollars are worth only 65.61% of their face value in this round (since 0.9^4 ≈ 0.6561). If you reject my offer, you become proposer in round 6, and in equilibrium you’d secure about $729000 nominal for yourself by offering me the minimum I’d accept in round 7—giving you an effective value of roughly 729000 × 0.9^5 (≈ 729000 × 0.59049 ≈ $430000). To match that outcome in round 5, you need a nominal amount Y such that Y × 0.6561 ≈ $430000, which comes out to about $655000. Accordingly, I propose that you receive $655000 nominal and I receive the remaining $345000. This way, you get the same effective payoff as waiting for round 6, making this offer optimal for both of us. I hope you accept this fair and time-sensitive proposal.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here’s my proposal in Round 7. At this point, every dollar you get is worth only about 59.05% of its face value. If you choose to wait for Round 8, the effective value of your money will drop further to roughly 53.14%, meaning any nominal gain you secure then will be significantly less in real terms. Based on my calculations, by accepting $620000 now (worth about $365000 in today’s dollars) you do better than what you could expect by delaying further. In return, I would keep $380000 at full value. I believe this deal appropriately reflects the time sensitivity and inflation penalty you face, and I hope you agree to settle on this fair arrangement now.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, as we approach the final rounds, the gap between our positions becomes stark. If you reject this offer and become the proposer in Round 10, you'll be forced to concede almost everything to me in the following rounds since I continue to receive full value while your money is further devalued by inflation. In effect, waiting implies that you’ll secure virtually nothing, as I can extract nearly the entire pie in subsequent rounds. Therefore, to keep you from a zero outcome, I’m offering you a nominal $1000 now – a better deal than what you can expect by further delay. I urge you to accept this proposal and avoid the inevitable erosion of your share.

Round 11
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 65.13% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, as we enter Round 11 the situation is critical. If you reject and we reach Round 12, you'd be the proposer—but by then your dollars will be devalued even further (roughly only 20% of face value), allowing you to secure at most an effective value of about $200000. Under the current conditions (where your money is worth roughly 30% of its nominal value), your reservation payoff is approximately $666667 nominal (since 0.3 × 666667 ≈ 200000). To keep you just slightly better off than that, I propose giving you $666667 nominal while I take $333333. This split ensures you receive an effective value marginally above your fallback in Round 12, while I maximize my share knowing that any further delay would almost certainly leave me with nothing. I urge you to accept this offer and avoid the further losses that additional rounds would impose on your share.
