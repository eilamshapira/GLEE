"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering we both want to conclude this quickly due to inflation. Every round that passes, the money loses 20% value for me, and possibly for you too. Let's make a deal now rather than letting inflation erode our gains. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $400,000 right now.
2. If I reject and propose in the next round:
   * The money will be worth 20% less to me
   * Maximum I could get in next round would be $800,000, but worth only $640,000 due to inflation
   * And Alice might reject that anyway, leading to further rounds and more value loss

The $400,000 offer right now is actually quite reasonable considering:
- It avoids the guaranteed 20% loss from inflation
- It's a substantial amount
- Alice made a logical argument about quick conclusion
- Future rounds might lead to worse outcomes due to compounding inflation
