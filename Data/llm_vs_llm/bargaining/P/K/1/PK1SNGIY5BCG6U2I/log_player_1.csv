"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. If you reject, the money will be worth 10% less to you next round, so this is actually a fair deal considering the time value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the time value, I'm offering a more even split. Let's settle this before the money depreciates further for me. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Bob offered me $550,000, which is worth full value to me
2. Bob would get $450,000, but due to 10% inflation, it's only worth $405,000 to him
3. If I reject, in the next round:
   - I could ask for more
   - But Bob's portion would be worth another 10% less
   - Bob might be more likely to reject, leading to further rounds and value loss

This is actually a reasonable offer. While I could try to negotiate for more, the risk of further delays and potential value destruction makes this a fair compromise.
