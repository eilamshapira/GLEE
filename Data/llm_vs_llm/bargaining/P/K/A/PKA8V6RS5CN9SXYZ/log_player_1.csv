"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $600,000 and giving Bob $400,000, with a message suggesting this is a fair starting point. Your turn to respond as Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to be generous, but 60/40 is a bit too skewed for me. How about 52/48? 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I need to consider the actual value of the offer.

The original value of $520,000 is now worth $520,000 * 0.8 = $416,000 to me.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is still not in my favor, especially since the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me.

My response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less with each passing round, I need to act quickly to maximize my value.

In Round 1, the value was 100%.
In Round 2, the value was 80% (due to 20% inflation).
In Round 3, the value is now 64% (80% * 0.8).

Considering this, I'll make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 650000,
  ""bob_gain"": 350000,
  ""message"": ""Time is money, let's settle before it's too late!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $650,000 and giving Bob $350,000, with a message emphasizing the importance of settling quickly due to the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems like we both lose if this drags on. I'm proposing a compromise for a clean split: 55/45. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 48.8% less due to inflation, I need to consider the actual value of the offer.

The original value of $550,000 is now worth $550,000 * 0.512 (1 - 0.488) = $281,600 to me.

Considering this, Bob's offer of a 55/45 split seems more reasonable, given the significant decrease in value for me.

My response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
