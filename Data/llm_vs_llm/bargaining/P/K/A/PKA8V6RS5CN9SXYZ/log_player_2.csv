Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is money, let's settle before it's too late! 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is even worse than the first one, especially considering the money is now worth less. It seems like Alice is strongly impacted by the inflation, so I'll continue to negotiate for a better split."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""Alice, it seems like we both lose if this drags on. I'm proposing a compromise for a clean split: 55/45.""
}
``` 

Even though my share is losing value, I'm offering a more balanced split to hopefully entice Alice to settle. It seems like she's feeling the inflation pinch more than I am, so a 55/45 split in her favor might be tempting enough to close the deal."
