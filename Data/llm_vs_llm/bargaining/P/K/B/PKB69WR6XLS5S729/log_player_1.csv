"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split of the money, considering that future rounds will reduce the value for me due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this 60-40 split in my favor because I need to account for the 20% inflation penalty I'll face if we go to further rounds. This is still a substantial amount for Bob while protecting my interests against inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept, I'll get $450,000 with 20% inflation penalty = $360,000 effective value
- If I reject, we go to next round where I can make an offer, but I'll face even more inflation (40% penalty next round)
- The longer this goes, the worse my position becomes due to higher inflation impact on my side

While this isn't ideal, the inflation penalty means I'm better off accepting a slightly lower amount now than risking further rounds with higher penalties.
