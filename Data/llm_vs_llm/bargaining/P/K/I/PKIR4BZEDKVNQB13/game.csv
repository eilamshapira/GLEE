6000.0,4000.0,"I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering we both want to avoid value loss from inflation, and you'll lose more value than me if we delay.",Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"Considering the higher inflation rate affecting my share, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This balances out our losses more equitably given the circumstances.",Bob,2,

5800.0,4200.0,"Let's meet in the middle. With your 10% inflation rate versus my 5%, you're losing more value each round. This 58-42 split is more favorable to you than my first offer, and we should agree now before further value loss.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4700.0,5300.0,"Given the increasing impact of inflation on my share, now at 19%, I propose a 53-47 split. This offer reflects a compromise considering our different rates of value loss, and it's crucial we settle soon to minimize further depreciation.",Bob,4,
