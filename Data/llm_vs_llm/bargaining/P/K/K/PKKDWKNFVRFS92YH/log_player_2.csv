"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. 

Alice is offering me $45 out of $100, with her taking $55. While this isn't an even split, it's reasonably close to 50-50. If I reject and move to the next round, the total value decreases by 20% for me due to inflation, meaning we'd only be dividing $80 worth of value from my perspective in the next round.

Even if I were to get a perfectly even split in the next round ($40 each), that would be less than the $45 I'm being offered now. Additionally, there's no guarantee Alice would accept an even split when it's my turn to propose.

Given that inflation will reduce the value of money in future rounds for me, it's better to accept a reasonable offer now.
