"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a division that considers our different inflation rates. I'll make an offer that's fair but also takes into account that money devalues faster for Bob than for me.

{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering you $40, Bob. Since your money devalues at 20% per round versus my 5%, accepting now gives you more value than waiting for future rounds. This is a fair split considering our different situations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since we're now in round 3, I need to consider the compounding inflation effects for both of us. I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45}

Bob, I'm offering you $45 now. Given that we're already in round 3, your inflation rate of 20% per round means waiting is very costly for you. At this point, money has already lost about 36% of its value for you since round 1, while only losing about 10% for me. This split recognizes that time pressure and offers you a better deal than my first proposal."
