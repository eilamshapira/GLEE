"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concern about inflation. Let's meet in the middle. This offer should be fairer considering the impact on you. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

I need to hold out for a better deal. While Alice is acknowledging the inflation, the offer is still tilted in her favor."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""The clock is ticking, and this inflation is brutal. I need a larger share to make up for the losses. This seems fair considering the circumstances.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly. This way, we both get a fair share considering the inflation impact on you. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is the best I can realistically hope for at this point.  The longer the game goes on, the more I lose to inflation. A 50/50 split is fair considering the circumstances."
