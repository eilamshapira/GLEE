"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to conclude this quickly to avoid inflation losses.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I think 55-45 is a more reasonable split. Let's settle this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
* If I accept now, I get $45, but it's worth 10% less due to inflation, so effectively $40.5
* If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount I get will be worth 20% less than original value
* Best case in next round would be getting $60, but with 20% inflation that would be worth $48
* There's risk Bob would reject again, leading to even more inflation losses
* Bob's current offer is reasonable considering the inflation pressure
