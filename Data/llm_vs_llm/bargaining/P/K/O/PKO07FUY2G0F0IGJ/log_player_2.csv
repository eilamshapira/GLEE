"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Looking at Alice's offer, she's proposing an equal split of the $1,000,000, with each of us getting $500,000.

This seems fair on the surface. While I could reject and make a counter-offer hoping to get more in the next round, there's something important to consider: inflation. The instructions mention that with each passing round, the money is worth 0% less for me, which actually means there's no inflation penalty for me. However, I don't know how inflation affects Alice.

Since there's no downside for me in terms of inflation, and a 50-50 split is generally considered fair, I'll accept this offer.
