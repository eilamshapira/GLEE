"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for round 2, considering the inflation:

```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000
}
```

My reasoning: I'm asking for slightly more than half, factoring in that the money's value is decreasing faster for me than for Alice. I hope this is acceptable to her, given the dwindling number of rounds and the increasing pressure of inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, let's try this again. Considering the increased inflation (36% for me, 19% for Alice), I need to adjust my offer.

```json
{
""bob_gain"": 570000,
""alice_gain"": 430000
}
```

Explanation: I'm increasing my share slightly to compensate for the higher inflation I'm experiencing. I hope this is a fair compromise that Alice will accept to avoid further losses."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, this is getting tight. Inflation is really biting now. I need to be more aggressive, but also realistic.

```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000
}
```

Reasoning: I'm asking for a significantly larger share now because my money is losing value so much faster. I understand this is a risky move, but I need to try and secure a reasonable amount before the remaining rounds are up. I hope Alice understands the urgency and accepts this offer."
