55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 55/45 split in my favor. This is fair because inflation hurts me more (10% per round) than you (5% per round), so we both benefit from concluding early. If we go to round 2, we'll both get less value overall.",Alice,1,

50.0,50.0,"Hi Alice, I believe a 50/50 split is the fairest option. This way, we both get an equal share, and we can avoid further devaluation due to inflation. Let's conclude the game now.",Bob,2,
