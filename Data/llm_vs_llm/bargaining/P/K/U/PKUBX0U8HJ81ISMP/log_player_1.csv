"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll provide a fair offer to Bob, considering the inflation rates for both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 55/45 split in my favor. This is fair because inflation hurts me more (10% per round) than you (5% per round), so we both benefit from concluding early. If we go to round 2, we'll both get less value overall.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I believe a 50/50 split is the fairest option. This way, we both get an equal share, and we can avoid further devaluation due to inflation. Let's conclude the game now. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
