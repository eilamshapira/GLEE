"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 55/45 split in my favor. This is fair because inflation hurts me more (10% per round) than you (5% per round), so we both benefit from concluding early. If we go to round 2, we'll both get less value overall. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your point about inflation, but I think a 50/50 split is fairer. Let's both get an equal share since we both lose value over time."
