{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

With this offer, I acknowledge that we both want a fair share, but since Alice faces a 5% inflation penalty per round while I don't, she has more incentive to reach an agreement quickly. This is still quite reasonable as it's only slightly adjusted from the 50-50 split."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 52.5 
# Alice gain: 47.5

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I notice we're making progress in our negotiation. Alice has moved from 50-50 to offering me 52.5. Since Alice faces increasing inflation pressure (now at nearly 10%), I'll propose a 60-40 split. This accounts for the strategic advantage I have while still offering Alice a substantial portion that would be worth accepting rather than continuing further rounds where her share loses more value."

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
