Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the potential decrease in value, I propose a 55/45 split in my favor this round. Let's find a balance that works for both of us before the value drops further. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Okay, let's factor in the inflation. My potential gain is worth 5% less, and Bob's is worth 10% less compared to round 1. To account for that and try to close the deal, I'll adjust my offer, aiming for something mutually acceptable given the diminishing value.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 525000,
  ""bob_gain"": 475000,
  ""message"": ""Bob, considering the value decrease, I'm offering a 52.5/47.5 split. This is my best offer to account for inflation and reach an agreement.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, with the value of money decreasing rapidly for me, I'm proposing a 57.5/42.5 split. We need to settle soon to minimize the impact of inflation. Let's make a deal. 
# Alice gain: 425000 
# Bob gain: 575000

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Alright, this is getting risky with the inflation. I need to make an offer that is acceptable but still reasonable for me, considering the decreasing value.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Bob, let's end this. I propose an even 50/50 split. It's fair, and we both avoid further losses due to inflation.""
