"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split of 50/50. We both get an equal share, and we can walk away with half a million each. How does that sound to you? 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering a 50/50 split, which would give me $500,000. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but due to 10% inflation, the total value to me would be worth less. Even if I could get a larger share next round, I'd need to get significantly more to offset the inflation loss.

A 50/50 split is actually quite fair, and there's risk in rejecting it - Alice might make a worse offer in future rounds, or we might end up with nothing if we can't agree within 12 rounds. Given the inflation penalty and the uncertainty of future negotiations, accepting this fair offer in the first round seems like the best decision.
