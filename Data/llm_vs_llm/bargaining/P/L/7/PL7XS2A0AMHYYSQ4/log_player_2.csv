"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split the money fairly! I'm proposing a slightly higher share for me as I'm making the first offer. Let's secure a good deal now before inflation hits hard. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $4,500 out of $10,000
2. This is a 45%-55% split
3. If I reject, we'll move to round 2, but the total amount will be worth 20% less ($8,000)
4. In round 2, I could propose a split, but Alice might reject it
5. Alice makes a fair point about securing a deal before inflation reduces the value

While I could try to negotiate for a 50-50 split, the risk of losing value to inflation and potential further negotiations makes this current offer quite reasonable. $4,500 now is better than potentially less later.
