600000.0,400000.0,"Let's split this fairly! I'll take 60% and you get 40%. It's a good deal for us both, and we can avoid any further rounds and inflation.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
500000.0,500000.0,Let's split it evenly. I believe this is fair for both of us.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Okay, Bob. Considering we are both losing value with each round, I'll adjust my offer. I'll take 55%, you get 45%. This is still a good split, and we can end this now before inflation eats away at both of our shares.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
520000.0,480000.0,"I understand the inflation concern. How about I take 48% and you take 52%? This way, we can still get a decent amount.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
510000.0,490000.0,"Alright Bob, let's get this done. Inflation is hitting us hard. I'll propose a 51/49 split in my favor. It's better than both of us getting nothing. Take it.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
530000.0,470000.0,I realize we need to be practical. How about a 47% for me and 53% for you? It's a slight compromise on both sides.,Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
505000.0,495000.0,"Okay, Bob. This is getting critical. I'm offering a 50.5/49.5 split. This is almost even and we really can't risk another round. Accept this and we both walk away with something.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
540000.0,460000.0,"I understand the urgency. How about I take 46% and you take 54%? It's a fair compromise, and we both gain something.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
502500.0,497500.0,"Bob, we're in the endgame now. This is a 50.25/49.75 split. Practically even. Take it before we lose everything. This is the last offer I'm making like this.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Let's finalize this. I'll take 45% and you take 55%. It's a decent offer given the situation, and we can ensure we both walk away with something.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
501250.0,498750.0,"Bob, last chance. I propose a 50.125/49.875 split. This is as close to even as I'm going to get. If you decline, we both get zero. Take it now.",Alice,11,
