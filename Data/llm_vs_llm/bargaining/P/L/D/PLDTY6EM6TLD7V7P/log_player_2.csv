"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. 

Alice is offering me $400,000 out of the total $1,000,000, which is 40% of the pot. If I reject and move to the next round, I can make my own offer, but the money will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation, meaning the entire pot would effectively be worth $950,000 to me.

Given that I can make a counter-offer in the next round and potentially get more than $400,000, even with the 5% inflation, I'll reject this initial offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that's fair but also advantageous to me, considering the inflation factor.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing a split where I receive $550,000 and Alice receives $450,000. This is reasonable because:
1. It's a more balanced division than Alice's initial offer
2. If Alice rejects this offer, she'll also face potential inflation in the next round
3. This gives Alice a substantial portion while allowing me to gain more than her initial offer to me"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to analyze this offer carefully considering the inflation information.

Alice is now offering me $420,000, which is slightly better than her initial offer of $400,000. However, due to inflation, this $420,000 is worth 9.75% less than it would have been in the first round. 

Calculating the actual value to me: $420,000 × (1 - 0.0975) = $379,050

Also, I now know that Alice is experiencing a higher inflation rate than I am (19% vs. 9.75%), which gives me some negotiating leverage.

If I reject and move to round 4, the money will be worth even less to both of us, but I could make a counter-offer. Given that Alice is facing a higher inflation rate, she may be more inclined to accept my next offer.

Since the current offer's real value to me ($379,050) is less than what I could have gotten in round 1 ($400,000), I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Now that I know Alice faces higher inflation (19% vs my 9.75%), I can make a strategic offer. Since her money loses value faster than mine, a fair deal that considers this difference is warranted.

{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000}

I'm offering Alice $480,000, which is a better offer than my last proposal. This is strategic because:

1. Given Alice's higher inflation rate, she has more incentive to accept now rather than later
2. If we go to another round, her share will lose value at a higher rate than mine
3. This is a more balanced split than her previous offers while still giving me an advantage
4. The total amount I'd receive ($520,000) even after my inflation rate is still better than her offers to me"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer considering the increasing inflation rates.

Alice is now offering me $440,000, but with 18.55% inflation, the real value to me is:
$440,000 × (1 - 0.1855) = $358,380

Alice's previous offer in round 3 had a real value to me of $379,050. This new offer is actually worth less to me in real terms despite the nominal increase.

Also notable is that Alice's inflation rate has increased significantly (now 34.39%), which is much higher than mine (18.55%). This suggests Alice is becoming increasingly desperate to reach a deal.

If I reject and counter-offer, I could potentially get a better deal since Alice is losing value much faster than I am. However, my own inflation is also accelerating, and continuing to postpone agreement risks further eroding the total value for both of us.

Given that the real value of this offer is decreasing for me and that Alice appears to be making incremental increases but not enough to offset inflation, I'll reject once more.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With inflation accelerating rapidly for both of us (but much faster for Alice), it's critical to reach an agreement soon. Given Alice's inflation rate is nearly twice mine, she has a stronger incentive to agree now.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a perfect 50-50 split. This is fair and strategic because:

1. It's a perfectly equal division that's hard to argue against on fairness grounds
2. Given Alice's much higher inflation rate (34.39% vs. my 18.55%), she stands to lose significantly more value by rejecting this offer
3. This is more generous than my previous offer, showing I'm willing to compromise
4. If we continue negotiating, both of us will lose substantial value due to accelerating inflation
5. A 50-50 split is a psychologically appealing endpoint that could help us reach agreement

This balanced offer respects both our interests while acknowledging the reality that continued delays hurt both of us, especially Alice."
