"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze Alice's offer:

Alice is offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000 total.

If I reject this offer, I'll make a counter-offer in the next round, but due to inflation, the total amount will be worth 10% less to me (effectively $900,000 from my perspective). My potential share would need to exceed $400,000 to make rejection worthwhile.

Since this is the first round and I could potentially propose a more favorable split in the next round (even with inflation), I'll reject this offer. I believe I can secure a better outcome.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split that accounts for the inflation I've already experienced while still being attractive enough for Alice to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I'd like to propose an even 50-50 split of the money. This is a fair division that gives us both equal shares of the available funds. Since I've already experienced 10% inflation from the first round, accepting this offer now would be beneficial for both of us rather than continuing to future rounds where the money's value will decrease further for me (and possibly for Alice too)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze Alice's new offer:

Alice is now offering me $450,000 out of the $1,000,000 total.

Due to inflation, this $450,000 is worth 19% less to me than it would have been in round 1, making it effectively worth about $364,500 in round 1 terms.

If I reject this offer, we'll move to round 4, where I can make another offer. However, the inflation will increase further, making any amount I receive worth even less.

Alice's current offer of $450,000 (worth $364,500 to me after inflation) is better than her initial offer of $400,000. Since inflation will continue to erode my purchasing power in future rounds, and Alice has shown willingness to improve her offer, I'll accept this proposal.
