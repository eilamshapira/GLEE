"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Alice is offering me 4500$ out of 10,000$. While this isn't an even split, it's a reasonable first offer at 45% of the total.

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but due to 20% inflation, the money will be worth less to me. My 4500$ would effectively become worth 3600$ after one round of inflation.

Since this is a decent offer and the inflation penalty is significant, I'll accept.
