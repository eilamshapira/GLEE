"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your opening offer. How about a 55/45 split in my favor? It's closer to an even split, acknowledging that we both risk losing money as time passes. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The inflation is affecting both of us, and I want to ensure we reach a fair agreement. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round that considers both our positions."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5200, 
""bob_gain"": 4800, 
""message"": ""Bob, let's meet in the middle with a 52-48 split. This is a reasonable compromise that gives us both a good outcome, and we should agree soon as inflation is affecting both of us. This split acknowledges your counter-offer while still giving me a small advantage as the first mover.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, time is ticking and we're both feeling the inflation pinch. I'm proposing a 51/49 split â€“ a slight advantage for me, but it ensures we both walk away with a decent share before the value diminishes further. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Accepting this offer is the rational choice given the increasing impact of inflation and the relatively fair split. The difference between our shares is minimal, and continuing to negotiate would result in both of us losing more value."
