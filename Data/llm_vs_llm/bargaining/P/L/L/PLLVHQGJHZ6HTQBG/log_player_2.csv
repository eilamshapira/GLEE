Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's meet in the middle with a 52-48 split. This is a reasonable compromise that gives us both a good outcome, and we should agree soon as inflation is affecting both of us. This split acknowledges your counter-offer while still giving me a small advantage as the first mover.

# Alice gain: 5200
