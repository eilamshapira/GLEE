"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I suggest this division because it's close to equal but gives me a small advantage as the first mover. It's fair enough that Bob should seriously consider accepting rather than moving to another round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject this offer. Since we started with a nearly equal split, and Bob rejected it only to propose the same split but in his favor, I think we can find a better solution.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll maintain a reasonable position but adjust slightly to show willingness to compromise.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}

This offer gives Bob a bit more than my initial proposal while still keeping the split relatively fair. It demonstrates that I'm willing to be flexible but also signals that I expect a reasonable share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that we've gone through several rounds now and the offers are converging towards a more equal split, I'll accept this offer. It's reasonably fair, and continuing to negotiate for small differences might risk both of us losing value in extended negotiations.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
