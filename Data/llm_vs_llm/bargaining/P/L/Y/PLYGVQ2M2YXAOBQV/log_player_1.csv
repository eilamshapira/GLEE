"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I need to make Bob an offer, keeping in mind the inflation that will affect me in later rounds. I want to secure a good deal for myself in this first round.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

My reasoning:

*   I'm offering Bob a substantial $400,000. This is a significant amount, which should make the offer attractive.
*   I'm prioritizing securing a larger share ($600,000) early, as the value of money decreases for me in subsequent rounds due to inflation.
*   I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, avoiding the risk of further rounds and the associated inflation for me."
