,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Hi Alice, since you face 5% inflation each round but I don't, a 50-50 split doesn't account for this difference. I'm proposing a 55-45 split that better reflects our situation. This is still fair as you'd lose value if we continue negotiating due to your inflation penalty.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Considering the inflation penalty, I'm willing to take a bit more to make up for the loss in value. Let's settle this before it's too late.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4200.0,5800.0,"Alice, I notice you're actually asking for more than 50% despite facing inflation penalties. Let's be practical: with each round, your share loses 5% value, while mine doesn't. A fair deal needs to account for this reality. My offer gives you $4200 which is worth more now than a larger amount several rounds later. We still have 8 rounds to go, but your money will be worth significantly less by then.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, I understand you're trying to take advantage of my inflation penalty, but I'm not willing to give up that much value. Let's meet in the middle and settle this before it's too late. We're running out of time, and I'm not getting any better offers by waiting.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, I see you're still asking for more than half despite your increasing inflation penalty. Let's be clear about our situation: Your money is now worth almost 20% less than in round 1, and this penalty will keep growing. My offer of $4000 to you now is actually worth more to you than a larger amount several rounds later. We only have 6 rounds left after this one. If we reach round 12 without agreement, we both get zero. A rational strategy should account for your inflation disadvantage - please consider this offer carefully.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
4800.0,5200.0,"Bob, I understand that my inflation penalty is growing, and I'm willing to make a compromise. This offer is more favorable to you than my previous ones, and I hope you'll consider it. We're running out of time, and I'd rather settle for a fair deal now than risk getting nothing in Round 12. Let's find a middle ground and end this negotiation.",Alice,7,
