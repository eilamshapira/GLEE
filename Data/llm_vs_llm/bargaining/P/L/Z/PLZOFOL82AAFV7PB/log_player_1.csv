"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since you face 5% inflation each round but I don't, a 50-50 split doesn't account for this difference. I'm proposing a 55-45 split that better reflects our situation. This is still fair as you'd lose value if we continue negotiating due to your inflation penalty. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation penalty, I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 5% less for me in this round, the actual value I'd get from Bob's offer is:
4500 / 1.05 = approximately 4286 (in terms of the original value)

I'm not convinced that this offer is fair, given that I'm the one facing the inflation penalty.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now (5% less in Round 2 and another 5% less in Round 3), I'll try to make a more favorable offer to compensate for the inflation penalty.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 5200, 
""bob_gain"": 4800, 
""message"": ""Considering the inflation penalty, I'm willing to take a bit more to make up for the loss in value. Let's settle this before it's too late.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I notice you're actually asking for more than 50% despite facing inflation penalties. Let's be practical: with each round, your share loses 5% value, while mine doesn't. A fair deal needs to account for this reality. My offer gives you $4200 which is worth more now than a larger amount several rounds later. We still have 8 rounds to go, but your money will be worth significantly less by then. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value I'd get from Bob's offer, considering the inflation penalty:

The money is worth 15% less for me (5% in Round 1, 5% in Round 2, and 5% in Round 3, but since it's cumulative: 1 - 0.05 = 0.95, 0.95 - 0.05*0.95 = 0.9025, 0.9025 - 0.05*0.9025 = 0.8574, so approximately 14.26% less), so:
4200 / 1.1426 = approximately 3673 (in terms of the original value)

I'm not convinced that this offer is fair, given that I'm the one facing the inflation penalty. Bob's offer seems to take advantage of my situation, and I'm not willing to accept such a low value.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth approximately 19.51% less for me now (cumulative inflation penalty: 1 - 0.05 = 0.95, 0.95 - 0.05*0.95 = 0.9025, 0.9025 - 0.05*0.9025 = 0.8574, 0.8574 - 0.05*0.8574 = 0.8145, so approximately 19.51% less in value), I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the loss in value.

Here's my offer for Round 5:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to take advantage of my inflation penalty, but I'm not willing to give up that much value. Let's meet in the middle and settle this before it's too late. We're running out of time, and I'm not getting any better offers by waiting.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see you're still asking for more than half despite your increasing inflation penalty. Let's be clear about our situation: Your money is now worth almost 20% less than in round 1, and this penalty will keep growing. My offer of $4000 to you now is actually worth more to you than a larger amount several rounds later. We only have 6 rounds left after this one. If we reach round 12 without agreement, we both get zero. A rational strategy should account for your inflation disadvantage - please consider this offer carefully. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value I'd get from Bob's offer, considering the inflation penalty:

The money is worth approximately 22.62% less for me (cumulative inflation penalty), so:
4000 / 1.2262 = approximately 3261 (in terms of the original value)

I'm starting to feel the pressure of the inflation penalty, and Bob's offer, although still not ideal, is starting to look more reasonable. However, I'm not convinced that I should accept such a low value, considering I'm still willing to negotiate.

But, considering the risk of reaching Round 12 and getting nothing, I might need to reassess my strategy.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth approximately 25.89% less for me now (cumulative inflation penalty), I'll try to make a more reasonable offer, considering the increasing pressure of the inflation penalty.

Here's my offer for Round 7:

{""alice_gain"": 4800, 
""bob_gain"": 5200, 
""message"": ""Bob, I understand that my inflation penalty is growing, and I'm willing to make a compromise. This offer is more favorable to you than my previous ones, and I hope you'll consider it. We're running out of time, and I'd rather settle for a fair deal now than risk getting nothing in Round 12. Let's find a middle ground and end this negotiation.""}"
