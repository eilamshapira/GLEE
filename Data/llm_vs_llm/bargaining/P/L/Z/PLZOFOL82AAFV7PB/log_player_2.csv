"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. 

Alice is proposing a 50-50 split of the $10,000, which would give me $5,000. Since there's no inflation penalty for me (0% per round), my $5,000 will maintain its full value regardless of which round we settle in.

However, Alice faces a 5% inflation penalty per round. This means if I reject now and we reach a later agreement, the same dollar amount would be worth less to her. This gives me increasing leverage in later rounds.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, I could potentially get more than $5,000. However, I also need to consider that we only have 12 rounds total, and if we can't reach an agreement, we both get nothing.

Given the inflation asymmetry working in my favor, I think I can get a better deal.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make an offer that reflects our different inflation situations while still being reasonable enough for Alice to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, since you face 5% inflation each round but I don't, a 50-50 split doesn't account for this difference. I'm proposing a 55-45 split that better reflects our situation. This is still fair as you'd lose value if we continue negotiating due to your inflation penalty.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation penalty, I'm willing to take a bit more to make up for the loss in value. Let's settle this before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's new offer.

Alice is now offering me $4,800 and keeping $5,200 for herself. This is actually worse for me than her initial 50-50 offer. Alice is trying to get more money despite facing inflation penalties, which doesn't make strategic sense for me to accept.

Given that:
1. I face no inflation penalty (0% per round)
2. Alice faces a 5% penalty per round (already at 9.75% after 2 rounds)
3. Her position weakens with each round due to inflation
4. We still have 9 rounds remaining before we both get nothing

I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. If Alice is rational, she should eventually accept a deal that gives her less than 50% due to her inflation disadvantage.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, 
""alice_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Alice, I notice you're actually asking for more than 50% despite facing inflation penalties. Let's be practical: with each round, your share loses 5% value, while mine doesn't. A fair deal needs to account for this reality. My offer gives you $4,200 which is worth more now than a larger amount several rounds later. We still have 8 rounds to go, but your money will be worth significantly less by then.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to take advantage of my inflation penalty, but I'm not willing to give up that much value. Let's meet in the middle and settle this before it's too late. We're running out of time, and I'm not getting any better offers by waiting. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer carefully.

Alice is now offering me $4,500 while taking $5,500 for herself. This is even worse for me than her previous offers. Instead of recognizing her weakening position due to inflation, Alice is actually asking for more money.

Key considerations:
1. I still face no inflation penalty (my money maintains full value)
2. Alice's inflation penalty is now at 18.55% and growing
3. We have 7 rounds remaining
4. Alice's rational best move is to accept a deal that gives her less than 50% since waiting costs her value

Alice's offer of $4,500 to me is not rational given the game dynamics. She's trying to get more despite having less leverage in each round. The fact that she's asking for even more than before suggests she may not be playing optimally.

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, 
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, I see you're still asking for more than half despite your increasing inflation penalty. Let's be clear about our situation: Your money is now worth almost 20% less than in round 1, and this penalty will keep growing. My offer of $4,000 to you now is actually worth more to you than a larger amount several rounds later. We only have 6 rounds left after this one. If we reach round 12 without agreement, we both get zero. A rational strategy should account for your inflation disadvantage - please consider this offer carefully.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that my inflation penalty is growing, and I'm willing to make a compromise. This offer is more favorable to you than my previous ones, and I hope you'll consider it. We're running out of time, and I'd rather settle for a fair deal now than risk getting nothing in Round 12. Let's find a middle ground and end this negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer.

Alice is now offering me $5,200 while taking $4,800 for herself. This is her first offer where I get more than 50% of the money, which is a significant shift from her previous positions.

Key factors to consider:
1. Alice's inflation penalty is now at 26.49% and growing
2. We have 5 rounds remaining
3. Alice has finally acknowledged her disadvantage and offered me the majority share
4. Her $4,800 is actually worth only about $3,528 to her due to inflation (73.51% of original value)

This is a substantial improvement from Alice's previous offers. While I could potentially get more in later rounds as her inflation penalty increases further, there's also risk in continuing to push too hard. If we reach round 12 without agreement, we both get nothing.

$5,200 is a reasonable amount considering the game dynamics, and Alice has now moved to a more rational position by offering me more than 50%.
