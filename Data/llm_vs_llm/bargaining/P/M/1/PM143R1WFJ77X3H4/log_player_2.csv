"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of the money after inflation:

For Bob:
- Original value: $450,000
- Inflation: 9.75%
- Value after inflation: $450,000 * (1 - 0.0975) = $406,875

For Alice:
- Original value: $550,000
- Inflation: 19%
- Value after inflation: $550,000 * (1 - 0.19) = $445,500

Given this, I will reject the offer because the value after inflation is less than an even split.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Before making an offer, let's consider the effects of inflation:

For Bob:
- Inflation so far: 19.5%
- Value of $1,000,000 after inflation: $1,000,000 * (1 - 0.195) = $805,000

For Alice:
- Inflation so far: 38.1%
- Value of $1,000,000 after inflation: $1,000,000 * (1 - 0.381) = $619,000

Given the asymmetric effects of inflation, I will offer a slight advantage to Alice to make the offer more appealing to her, while still ensuring a fair split considering the inflation effects.
