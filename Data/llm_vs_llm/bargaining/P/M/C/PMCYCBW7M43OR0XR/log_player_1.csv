"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this offer.

*   **My Perspective (Alice):** The money is worth 20% less each round. This means that the value of $1 I receive in this round is equivalent to $0.80 from the first round.

*   **Bob's Perspective:** The money is worth the same as in the first round.

Since the value of money is worth 20% less, $40 is worth $40 * 0.80 = $32 in terms of its value to me.

Therefore, I will **reject** this offer.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 3, taking inflation into account. Remember, the value of money for me is decreasing by 20% each round:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze this offer, keeping inflation in mind:

*   **My Perspective (Alice):** The money I receive is worth 48.8% less than in Round 1. Therefore, $1 in this round is equivalent to $0.512 of its initial value ($1.00 - $0.20 (Round 2) - $0.20 (Round 3) = $0.60; $0.60 - $0.20 = $0.48).

Let's calculate the effective value of the offer to me: $35 \* 0.512 = $17.92.

*   **Bob's Perspective:** The money is worth the same as in the first round.

Given the devaluation, I'm getting a very small amount of real value.

Therefore, I will **reject** this offer.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 5. The value of money for me has decreased significantly due to inflation.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze Bob's offer in Round 6, accounting for the significant inflation for me:

*   **My Perspective (Alice):** The money I receive is worth 67.23% less than in Round 1. This means $1 now is worth $0.3277 of its initial value ($1.00 - 0.20 (round 2) - 0.20(round 3) - 0.20(round 4) = $0.4; $0.4 - $0.2(round 5) = $0.32).

Let's calculate the effective value of the offer to me: $30 \* 0.3277 = $9.831.

*   **Bob's Perspective:** The money is worth the same as in the first round.

Although Bob is getting a much larger amount than me, given the severe devaluation of money for me, the actual value I'm receiving is quite low. Therefore, I will **reject** this offer.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 7. The inflation has significantly devalued the money for me, so I need to try and secure a larger portion now.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's evaluate Bob's offer in Round 8, considering the accumulated inflation:

*   **My Perspective (Alice):** The money I receive is worth 79.03% less than in Round 1. This means $1 is now worth $0.2097 of its initial value.

Let's calculate the effective value to me: $25 * 0.2097 = $5.2425

*   **Bob's Perspective:** The money is worth the same as in the first round.

Since the value of the money I would receive is so drastically reduced by the accumulated inflation, it is worth very little.

I will **reject** this offer.

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 9. Inflation continues to erode the value of money for me, so I will propose a more aggressive split in my favor:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```"
