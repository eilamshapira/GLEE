"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I will make a reasonable offer considering the circumstances, especially the inflation affecting me.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, considering the continued inflation affecting me by 20% now (10% per round cumulative), and the fact that Bob rejected a relatively generous offer from me previously, I will adjust my proposal. I'll still aim for a fair split, but I need to account for the diminishing value of the money for me.
