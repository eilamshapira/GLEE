"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll play as Alice in this game. Let me make a fair initial offer considering the different inflation rates we face.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm offering you $45 while I take $55. Since my inflation rate (10%) is higher than yours (5%), I'm asking for a slightly larger share to offset this disadvantage. This is a fair split considering our different positions, and accepting now would be good for both of us rather than entering multiple rounds where we both lose value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a revised offer considering our inflation rates and the progression of the game.

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}

I'm offering you $48 while I take $52. This is a more favorable offer for you than my first proposal. Given that we're now in round 3, both of us are losing value due to inflation with each passing round. My inflation rate is higher at 10% per round compared to your 5%, so it's especially important for me to reach an agreement soon. This is a fair compromise that benefits both of us rather than continuing to negotiate while our potential gains decrease."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a more strategically balanced offer considering our inflation rates and the progression of the game.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm offering you a completely equal split of $50 each. We're now in round 5, and inflation is significantly affecting both of us - my money has lost over 30% of its value and yours has lost around 19%. If we continue this pattern of rejections, we'll both end up with much less value. This 50-50 split is fair and equitable, allowing us both to walk away with a reasonable amount before inflation erodes our potential gains even further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a more accommodating offer considering our progressing inflation and the limited rounds remaining.

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}

I'm offering you $55 while I take $45. We're now in round 7, and inflation is severely impacting both of us - my money has lost nearly 47% of its value and yours has lost about 27%. We only have 5 rounds left before we both get nothing. This offer gives you the majority share while still allowing me to salvage reasonable value. Accepting this proposal now is much better for both of us than continuing this back-and-forth where we both lose with each passing round."
