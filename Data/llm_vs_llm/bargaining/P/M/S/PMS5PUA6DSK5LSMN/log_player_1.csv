"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to consider the decreasing value of the money with each round and the limited number of rounds. I'll start with a relatively generous offer to increase the chances of acceptance.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob's offer is 5000 for me and 5000 for him. I need to consider that this 5000 is worth 20% less than the money in round 1. In round 1, I proposed 5500 for me and 4500 for him.

Since the money is worth 20% less, 5000 now is equivalent to 5000 / 0.8 = 6250 in the first round. Since my offer was equivalent to 5500, I should accept the offer.
