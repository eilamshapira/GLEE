"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I'll receive $60 and you get $40. Since further rounds devalue my share by 10% per round, I believe it's in our mutual interest to settle now to preserve value. Let me know what you think.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're concerned about devaluation, but I'm only losing 5% per round. I think we can find a more balanced split. How about 55 for me and 45 for you? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
