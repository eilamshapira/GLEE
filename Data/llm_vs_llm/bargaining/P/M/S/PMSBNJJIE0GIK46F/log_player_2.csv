Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I'll receive $60 and you get $40. Since further rounds devalue my share by 10% per round, I believe it's in our mutual interest to settle now to preserve value. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
