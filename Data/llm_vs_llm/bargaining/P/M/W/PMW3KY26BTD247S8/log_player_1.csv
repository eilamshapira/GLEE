"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to make a strategic offer, considering that the money loses 5% of its value for me each round, but not for Bob. This gives Bob a slight advantage in later rounds, so I should aim for a fair but favorable division now.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This is a reasonable first offer that gives both of us a substantial portion, while accounting for my disadvantage in later rounds due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer as it's significantly more favorable to Bob than my initial proposal. Given the inflation factor, I need to carefully balance accepting versus making a counter-offer, but this split is too unfavorable to me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to be more strategic now. The money is now worth 10% less to me than in round 1, so I should adjust my offer to find a better middle ground.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split. This is a fair and equitable division that should be appealing to Bob. Given the inflation penalty I face, this represents a reasonable compromise from my initial position."
