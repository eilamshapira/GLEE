"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, how about we split it 60-40? I think it's a fair start considering I proposed first. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing a 60-40 split in her favor, giving me $40 and herself $60. While a 50-50 split might seem more fair, I should keep in mind that rejecting means the money loses 20% value in the next round. If I reject, we'd be splitting $80 in round 2, and I'd need to get more than 50% of that to beat the current $40 offer.

Given the significant inflation penalty, I'll accept this reasonable first offer rather than risk further devaluation.
