Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering that each additional round reduces the pie’s value by 5%, I propose a fair split that reflects our discounted future positions. Accepting this offer now gives you approximately 487180 dollars, which aligns with what you'd get by waiting. Let’s seal the deal and avoid further discounting. 
# Alice gain: 487180 
# Bob gain: 512820
