"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a slightly higher share for me since I face a 5% inflation penalty each round. If we don't agree quickly, we both lose value. This split is fair considering my disadvantage.

# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer, but my inflation penalty compounds with each round, making my situation worse than yours. This 52.5/47.5 split is a fair compromise given my disadvantage. Let's agree now before both of us lose more value.

# Alice gain: 52.5
