"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering a split where I would get $100,000 and she would get $900,000, which is quite disproportionate in her favor. Since there's no inflation for me according to the rules, I have no pressure to accept an unfair deal early. I believe I can propose a more equitable distribution in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split that's fair to both of us.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose an even 50-50 split of the money. This gives us both equal shares of $500,000, which I believe is the most fair and equitable division."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 280000 
# Alice gain: 720000 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice is now affected by inflation (36% reduction in value for her), which explains why she's increasing her offer to me from $100,000 to $280,000. However, I'm not affected by inflation according to the rules, so I can still negotiate for a better deal.

The offer of $280,000 for me and $720,000 for Alice is still considerably in her favor. Since I don't face any inflation penalty, I can afford to make a counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice is facing increasing inflation pressure while I'm not, I'll propose a more favorable split but still be reasonable to encourage acceptance.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I propose a 55-45 split that gives me $550,000 and Alice $450,000. Given that Alice faces inflation penalties while I don't, this offer gives her a substantial amount that's worth more now than it will be in future rounds, while still being fair to both parties."
