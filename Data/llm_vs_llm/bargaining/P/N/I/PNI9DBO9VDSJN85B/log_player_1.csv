"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a proposal for dividing the $1,000,000 between me (Alice) and Bob.

Since I'm going first, I need to consider our relative positions. The money doesn't lose value for me across rounds, but each round makes Bob's portion worth 5% less to him. This gives me some leverage, but I should still be fair to reach an agreement.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000. This is a reasonable split that gives me a slight advantage as the first mover, but still offers Bob a substantial portion that should be attractive to accept now rather than risk depreciation of his value in future rounds."
