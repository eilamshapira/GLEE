"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor - this is a fair offer considering we both want to conclude this quickly to avoid inflation losses.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split in my favor is a fair compromise. It's a slight shift from your initial proposal, but it allows us to both get more than we would if we keep rejecting offers and face inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think through this:

1. If I accept Bob's offer now:
   * I get $4,500, but with 5% inflation = $4,275 real value
   * Bob gets $5,500, but with 20% inflation = $4,400 real value

2. If I reject and make another offer:
   * Next round will have even more inflation (10% for me, unknown for Bob)
   * We risk losing more value through continued negotiation
   * There's no guarantee Bob will accept my next offer

Given that:
1. The real value I'm getting ($4,275) is still substantial
2. Further delays will only reduce the money's value more
3. The split is not extremely unfair (55-45)
4. Bob made a reasonable counter-offer
