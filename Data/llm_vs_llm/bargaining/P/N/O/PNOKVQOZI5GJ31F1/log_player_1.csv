"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to make a fair offer that Bob will accept. Given the 20% inflation for Bob versus 5% for me, it makes sense for Bob to accept a reasonable offer now rather than wait. However, I also need to consider that Bob might want a substantial portion to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This gives Bob a significant portion upfront, which should be attractive given his higher inflation rate. If he rejects this, he loses 20% of the value in the next round, which would be a substantial loss compared to accepting this offer now."
