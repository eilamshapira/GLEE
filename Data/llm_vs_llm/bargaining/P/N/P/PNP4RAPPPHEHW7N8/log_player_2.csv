"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. It's a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, if I reject, any amount I get in the next round will be worth 5% less to me
4. If I propose something like 5500/4500 in the next round, Alice might reject it, leading to further rounds and more value loss
5. The current offer of 5000 with no inflation loss is probably better than a potentially higher amount that's worth less due to inflation
