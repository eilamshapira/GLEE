"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing I get $400,000 while she gets $600,000.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, I'll face 20% inflation (my $400,000 would only be worth $320,000 to me in the next round). Meanwhile, Alice only faces 5% inflation.

This significant inflation difference puts me at a disadvantage in later rounds, making this initial offer relatively attractive despite not being an even split.
