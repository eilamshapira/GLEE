"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I propose this split as it gives me a fair majority while still leaving Alice with a substantial portion. Given the 10% inflation penalty per round, it would be rational for Alice to accept this offer rather than prolonging the negotiation and losing value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The offer is fair and reasonable, giving me a slight majority. Given the mounting inflation penalties and the risk of further negotiations reducing the total value, this is a good deal to accept now."
