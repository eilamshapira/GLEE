"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully, comparing it to what I might achieve in future rounds, keeping in mind the different inflation rates.

If I reject, in the next round I could make a counter-offer, but Alice's share would only be worth 95% of its current value, while my share would be worth 80% of its current value.

This offer gives me only $1,000 of the $10,000, which is quite uneven. With the different inflation rates, I should try to reach an agreement sooner rather than later, but this offer is too unbalanced for me to accept.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer that accounts for our different inflation rates. Since my money loses value faster (20% per round vs Alice's 5%), I should propose a fair split that Alice would find reasonable enough to accept now.

{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500}

I'm offering Alice more than half of the money to acknowledge the time value differences, but ensuring I still receive a fair portion. This is much more equitable than the initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer considering our different inflation rates.

Alice has improved her offer substantially from round 1, now offering me $4,000 instead of just $1,000. Due to inflation, my money is now worth 36% less than in round 1, while Alice's is worth 9.75% less.

If I reject and we go to round 4, my money will be worth even less (about 49% less than round 1), while Alice's would only be worth about 14.3% less than round 1. The gap continues to widen with each round.

Given the significant improvement in Alice's offer and the accelerating disadvantage I face from inflation, this is a reasonable compromise.
