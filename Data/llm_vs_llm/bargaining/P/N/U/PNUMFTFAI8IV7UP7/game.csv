6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, recognizing that inflation affects me more severely (20% vs. your 10%). This arrangement gives us both substantial value while accounting for our different positions. If we delay, we both lose value, but I lose more.",Alice,1,

4600.0,5400.0,"Alice, considering the impact of inflation on both our values, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor this time. This accounts for the reduced value we both face, but also recognizes my relatively better position due to the lower inflation rate affecting me. Let's settle before further devaluation.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, let's be practical about this. With each round, we both lose value - me at 20% and you at 10%. The $10000 is now worth significantly less to both of us than in round 1. This 55-45 split is fair considering our inflation differentials and avoids further devaluation for both of us. It's in our mutual interest to agree now rather than continue this negotiation where we both lose.",Alice,3,
