"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer that acknowledges both our interests and the different inflation rates affecting us.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, recognizing that inflation affects me more severely (20% vs. your 10%). This arrangement gives us both substantial value while accounting for our different positions. If we delay, we both lose value, but I lose more.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the impact of inflation on both our values, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor this time. This accounts for the reduced value we both face, but also recognizes my relatively better position due to the lower inflation rate affecting me. Let's settle before further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 4600 
# Bob gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical about this. With each round, we both lose value - me at 20% and you at 10%. The $10,000 is now worth significantly less to both of us than in round 1. This 55-45 split is fair considering our inflation differentials and avoids further devaluation for both of us. It's in our mutual interest to agree now rather than continue this negotiation where we both lose.""
