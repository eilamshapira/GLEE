"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, recognizing that inflation affects me more severely (20% vs. your 10%). This arrangement gives us both substantial value while accounting for our different positions. If we delay, we both lose value, but I lose more. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Alice after each round, I'll take that into account for my offer.

The initial amount was $10,000. After one round, it's worth:
- For me: $10,000 * 0.9 = $9,000
- For Alice: $10,000 * 0.8 = $8,000

Considering the decreased value, I'll propose a split that reflects our relative positions and the impact of inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 5400,
""alice_gain"": 4600,
""message"": ""Alice, considering the impact of inflation on both our values, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor this time. This accounts for the reduced value we both face, but also recognizes my relatively better position due to the lower inflation rate affecting me. Let's settle before further devaluation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical about this. With each round, we both lose value - me at 20% and you at 10%. The $10000 is now worth significantly less to both of us than in round 1. This 55-45 split is fair considering our inflation differentials and avoids further devaluation for both of us. It's in our mutual interest to agree now rather than continue this negotiation where we both lose. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
