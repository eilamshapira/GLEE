"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split that accounts for the higher inflation penalty I face (10% vs Bob's 5%). I'll aim for a slightly larger share to offset this disadvantage.

{""alice_gain"": 5400, ""bob_gain"": 4600}

I propose this split because it's relatively fair while accounting for my higher inflation risk if negotiations continue. This way, we can both walk away with a good outcome without risking value loss through inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. The offered amount for me is $5000, but due to 10% inflation, it's actually worth $4500 to me
2. The previous round I offered myself $5400 (without inflation)
3. If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount would be worth 20% less for me and 15% less for Bob
4. This would significantly reduce the real value of any future deal

Even though this is less than what I initially proposed, given the inflation penalties, accepting now is better than continuing to negotiate with increasing penalties.
