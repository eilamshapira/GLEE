"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to make a fair offer to Bob, but I also want to ensure I get a good share of the money. Since the money is worth 10% less to me in each passing round, I have an incentive to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. However, I don't know how inflation affects Bob, which adds some uncertainty.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I suggest this division because it gives me a slightly larger share while still offering Bob a substantial amount. I believe this is fair considering the inflation risk I face in future rounds."
