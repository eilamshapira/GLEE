"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is offering me $450,000 of the $1,000,000, which is 45% of the total. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but I'll face 5% inflation, meaning the total value to me would be $950,000, and my next offer would need to account for that.

If I reject and propose a 50-50 split next round, I'd be asking for $475,000 (50% of $950,000), which is only $25,000 more than what Alice is offering now. The risk of further negotiation might not be worth that relatively small gain, especially if Alice rejects my counter-offer.
