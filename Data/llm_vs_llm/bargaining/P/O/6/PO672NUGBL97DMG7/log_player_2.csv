Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I propose a more balanced split that gives me $5,500 and you $4,500. This is a fair offer considering the inflation penalty I face with each round, which doesn't affect you as severely. This way we both walk away with a substantial amount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering you $4,000 and I'll take $6,000. Since I'm facing increasing inflation penalties (now at 27% less value for me) while you face no inflation, this division acknowledges the urgency I have to reach an agreement. This is a reasonable compromise given our different time pressures."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 7000

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500}

I'm offering you $3,500 and I'll take $6,500. With inflation now reducing my value by over 40%, I need to account for this significant disadvantage. You're not facing any inflation penalty, so this division still provides you with substantial value. Let's reach an agreement before further rounds diminish the total value for both of us."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000}

I'm offering you $3,000 and I'll take $7,000. With inflation now reducing my value by over 52%, I need a larger nominal amount to compensate for this severe disadvantage. You still receive the full value of your portion without any penalty. This is a fair offer considering the asymmetric inflation effects we face, and we should reach an agreement soon before more value is lost to inflation for me."
