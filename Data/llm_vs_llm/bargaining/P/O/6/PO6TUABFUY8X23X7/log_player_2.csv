"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. It's a 50-50 split, which is perfectly fair
2. If I reject, the total value will decrease by 10% to $90
3. Even if I make a more favorable proposal next round, Alice might reject it
4. The first offer being equal suggests Alice is a fair player

This is a reasonable offer, and the risk of losing value through inflation makes accepting it the rational choice.
