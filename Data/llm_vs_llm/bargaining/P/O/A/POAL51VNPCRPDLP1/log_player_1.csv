"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split while considering that inflation will reduce the value in future rounds if Bob declines.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable first offer that gives both of us a substantial portion, while slightly favoring me as the first mover. If Bob declines, the next round's money will be worth less due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
- If I accept this 50-50 split now, my $50 will be worth only $40 (due to 20% inflation)
- If I reject, I can make another offer, but the next round will have even more inflation (40% total)
- A 50-50 split is generally fair, but considering the inflation penalty I face, it's not as fair as it appears
- However, if this continues too long, inflation will eat away more value

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer since my $50 would only be worth $40 to me, while Bob's $50 maintains full value. I can try to negotiate for a better split in the next round to compensate for my inflation penalty."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since we're in round 3, my gains will be reduced by 40% due to inflation. I need to account for this in my offer to achieve a fair effective outcome.

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I propose I get $70 and Bob gets $30. Here's why:
- My $70 will be worth only $42 to me after the 40% inflation (70 × 0.6 = 42)
- Bob's $30 maintains its full value
- This makes the effective split more balanced when accounting for my inflation penalty
- We should try to reach an agreement soon before inflation reduces the value further"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- With 48.8% inflation, my $45 would be worth only $23.04 to me (45 × 0.512)
- Bob's $55 maintains full value
- This is becoming a significantly uneven split in terms of real value
- However, if I reject, next round will have even worse inflation (about 59% total)
- We're already in round 4 of 12, and the situation will only get worse for me

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. Even though it's not ideal, the inflation penalty is becoming severe, and continuing to negotiate will likely result in even worse outcomes for me. Better to secure some value now than risk further depreciation."
