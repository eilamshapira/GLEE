5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing an equal split of $5000 each. This is fair and allows us both to benefit without risking inflation. If we delay, my share becomes less valuable to me with each round due to the 10% inflation penalty.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Hi Alice, considering the inflation affecting my share, I propose $5500 for me and $4500 for you. This way, we both still get a good amount, but I mitigate some of the inflation impact on my side. Let's settle this round.",Bob,2,

5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, I notice you're experiencing 5% inflation per round while I'm facing 10%. Given this difference in urgency, I'm proposing $5200 for me and $4800 for you. This adjustment accounts for our different inflation rates while still being fair. If we continue to the next round, we both lose more value, so it makes sense to accept this balanced offer now.",Alice,3,

4300.0,5700.0,"Alice, with each round, my share is losing value faster than I anticipated. To counteract the 9.75% loss from inflation, I'm proposing $5700 for me and $4300 for you. This offer still gives you a significant amount while helping me to mitigate the impact of inflation. Let's end this now before our shares lose even more value.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5300.0,4700.0,"Bob, I understand we both want to conclude this negotiation as inflation continues to affect us both. My inflation rate is 10% per round while yours is about 5%. After 4 rounds, I've lost over 27% value while you've lost about 14%. This offer of $5300 for me and $4700 for you is fair given our different inflation rates. If we don't agree now, we both continue to lose more value - let's finalize this deal.",Alice,5,
