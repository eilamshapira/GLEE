"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make my first offer to Bob. Given the 10% inflation per round, I want to propose a fair division that takes this into account.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing an equal split of $5000 each. This is fair and allows us both to benefit without risking inflation. If we delay, my share becomes less valuable to me with each round due to the 10% inflation penalty.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation affecting my share, I propose $5500 for me and $4500 for you. This way, we both still get a good amount, but I mitigate some of the inflation impact on my side. Let's settle this round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer considering the inflation effects we're both experiencing.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""Bob, I notice you're experiencing 5% inflation per round while I'm facing 10%. Given this difference in urgency, I'm proposing $5200 for me and $4800 for you. This adjustment accounts for our different inflation rates while still being fair. If we continue to the next round, we both lose more value, so it makes sense to accept this balanced offer now.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, with each round, my share is losing value faster than I anticipated. To counteract the 9.75% loss from inflation, I'm proposing $5700 for me and $4300 for you. This offer still gives you a significant amount while helping me to mitigate the impact of inflation. Let's end this now before our shares lose even more value. 
# Alice gain: 4300 
# Bob gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that accounts for our different inflation rates and the increasing urgency to reach an agreement.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5300,
  ""bob_gain"": 4700,
  ""message"": ""Bob, I understand we both want to conclude this negotiation as inflation continues to affect us both. My inflation rate is 10% per round while yours is about 5%. After 4 rounds, I've lost over 27% value while you've lost about 14%. This offer of $5300 for me and $4700 for you is fair given our different inflation rates. If we don't agree now, we both continue to lose more value - let's finalize this deal.""
