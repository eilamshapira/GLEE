"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 60-40 split in my favor. Since we face 20% inflation per round on my side, accepting now gives us both more total value than if we delay. If we go multiple rounds, we'll both end up with significantly less real value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your point about inflation, but 60-40 is too skewed for me.  Let's meet in the middle with a 55-45 split. This round, or the deal gets worse for both of us next round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
