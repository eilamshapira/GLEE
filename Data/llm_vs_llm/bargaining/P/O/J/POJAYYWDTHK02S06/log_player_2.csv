"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 60-40 split in my favor. Since we face 20% inflation per round on my side, accepting now gives us both more total value than if we delay. If we go multiple rounds, we'll both end up with significantly less real value. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
