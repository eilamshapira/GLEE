"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share, let's agree 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $40 while taking $60
2. If I reject and move to the next round:
   - The money will be worth 10% less for me ($100 â†’ $90 total value)
   - I can make my own proposal
   - But Alice might reject, leading to further devaluation

This isn't a completely fair split, but if we continue to negotiate, the decreasing value might leave us both worse off. However, I think I can get a better deal in the next round even with the 10% devaluation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a strategic offer:
1. The money is now worth $90 to me and $95 to Alice
2. I should propose a split that's better for me but still attractive enough for Alice to accept
3. A roughly 50-50 split of the original value might be fair, considering the devaluation

{""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Let's split it equally - this is fair for both of us, and further delays will only reduce the value for both""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle of our previous offers 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Current offer: $43 for me, $57 for Alice
2. With 19% devaluation for me, $43 is actually worth about $34.83 of original value
3. If I reject:
   - Next round will have 29% devaluation for me
   - $100 will be worth only $71 to me
   - Even if I get a better split, the total value keeps decreasing significantly
4. Alice's offer is a compromise between our previous positions
5. Further negotiation will lead to more value loss

Given the accelerating devaluation and the risk of further losses, I should accept this offer now.
