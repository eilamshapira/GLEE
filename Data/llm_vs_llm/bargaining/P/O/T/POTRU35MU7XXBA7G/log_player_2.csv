"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is a terrible offer for Bob! I'm confident we can negotiate a much fairer split. Let's see what Alice proposes next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000} 

This offer gives me a slight advantage, reflecting the fact that the money devalues more rapidly for Alice. Let's see if she accepts."
