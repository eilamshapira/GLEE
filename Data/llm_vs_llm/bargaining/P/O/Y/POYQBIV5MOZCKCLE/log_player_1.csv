"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer that takes into account the asymmetric inflation costs for both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

Since my inflation rate is higher (20% vs Bob's 10%), I'm proposing that I get a bit more in the first round to compensate for this disadvantage. This offer gives Bob a substantial portion while recognizing that if we delay, the total value decreases more quickly for me than for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I notice that we're facing diminishing returns with each round due to inflation. My money is now worth 40% less than in round 1, and Bob's is worth 20% less. Let me make a more balanced offer.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm adjusting my proposal to be more accommodating while still accounting for my higher inflation rate. This split is fair given that I'm penalized more severely by delays - my effective value is dropping faster than Bob's with each round."
