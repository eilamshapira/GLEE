"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer is $40 for me and $60 for Alice
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to inflation:
   - My $40 would become worth $36 (10% less)
   - Alice's $60 would become worth $48 (20% less)
4. This makes the current offer relatively better

While I could try to negotiate for more, the inflation penalty is significant, especially for Alice. She might be more willing to accept a reasonable counter-offer now than a better one later. However, I think I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer, even accounting for inflation.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that we're now in round 2, I'll make a strategic offer that considers:
1. The inflation effects (next round my money would be worth 10% less, Alice's 20% less)
2. The need to make an offer attractive enough for Alice to accept
3. The fact that Alice started with a 60-40 split in her favor

I'll propose a more balanced split, but still giving Alice a decent portion to make it attractive:

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

This is more favorable to me than the previous offer, but still gives Alice a significant portion. Given that her money devalues faster (20% per round), she has more incentive to accept this reasonable offer rather than continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Current offer: $45 for me, $55 for Alice
2. Due to inflation:
   - My $45 is actually worth $36.45 (81% of original value)
   - Alice's $55 is worth $35.20 (64% of original value)
3. If I reject:
   - Next round inflation will be even worse
   - My money will be worth 29% less
   - Alice's money will be worth 56% less

This offer is actually better than Alice's first offer ($40-$60), and given the significant inflation penalties we're both facing, continuing to negotiate will reduce the real value for both of us substantially. The difference between this offer and my ideal scenario is not worth the inflation cost of another round.
