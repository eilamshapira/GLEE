60.0,40.0,Let's make a fair split considering the 5% inflation penalty I face each round. I propose 60-40 in my favor to account for this disadvantage.,Alice,1,

50.0,50.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your concern about the 5% inflation penalty. However, even with that consideration, a 60-40 split seems too imbalanced. I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. If you reject, you'll face another 5% inflation penalty, making my offer more valuable than waiting another round. Let's settle this fairly now.",Bob,2,
