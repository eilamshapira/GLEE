"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concern about the 5% inflation penalty. However, even with that consideration, a 60-40 split seems too imbalanced. I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. If you reject, you'll face another 5% inflation penalty, making my offer more valuable than waiting another round. Let's settle this fairly now. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. Bob makes a valid point - with the 5% inflation penalty per round, waiting longer will only decrease the value of my share. A 50-50 split is fair, and getting $50 now is better than potentially getting less value in future rounds due to inflation."
