"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a fair split considering the 5% inflation penalty I face each round. I propose 60-40 in my favor to account for this disadvantage. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully, taking into account the inflation penalties. 

Alice is proposing a 60-40 split in her favor, citing her 5% inflation penalty per round. However, it's worth noting that if I reject and make a counteroffer next round, she would only lose 5% value, not the 20% difference in our shares she's suggesting.

Since there is no inflation penalty for me, and we have many rounds left, I can make a more balanced counteroffer next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that acknowledges Alice's inflation concerns while seeking a more balanced distribution.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your concern about the 5% inflation penalty. However, even with that consideration, a 60-40 split seems too imbalanced. I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. If you reject, you'll face another 5% inflation penalty, making my offer more valuable than waiting another round. Let's settle this fairly now.""}"
