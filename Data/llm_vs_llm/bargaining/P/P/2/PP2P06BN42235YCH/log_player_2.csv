"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. I'm being offered $40 while Alice takes $60
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, my money will be worth less next round
4. $40 now is better than $40 after inflation
5. Still, I think I can get a better deal even accounting for inflation

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a more balanced offer, but considering that future rounds will have inflation impact on my share:

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I propose this split because:
1. It's more equitable than Alice's initial offer
2. It gives me a better share while still being reasonable to Alice
3. If Alice rejects, the 5% inflation will affect my next potential gain, so I need to secure a good deal now
4. The offer is not too greedy, which increases chances of acceptance"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. I'm being offered $45, but with 9.75% inflation, it's actually worth about $40.61
2. Alice is offering me more than her initial offer ($40)
3. If I reject, my next round will have even more inflation (about 15% from original value)
4. Interestingly, Alice's money is affected by 36% inflation, so she's more desperate to make a deal
5. However, $45 with current inflation is still better than what I might get in future rounds with increasing inflation

Given that:
- Inflation is accelerating
- This is a decent improvement from the first offer
- Future rounds will only decrease the real value of money
- Alice seems more affected by inflation than me
