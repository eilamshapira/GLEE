"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money evenly and finish the game quickly. This way, we get the most out of the full amount before the value decreases. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer of a 50-50 split.

Given that each round decreases the value of money for me by 20% and for Alice by 5%, waiting would put me at a disadvantage. If I reject and we go to the next round, the $1M would be worth $800,000 to me and $950,000 to Alice.

If I counter-offer in round 2 with something like $550,000 for me and $450,000 for Alice, that would give me $550,000 Ã— 0.8 = $440,000 in round 1 value, which is less than the $500,000 I'm being offered now.

Since the inflation penalty affects me more severely, taking the fair 50-50 split now is actually the rational choice.
