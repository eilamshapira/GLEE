"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","For my first offer, I'll propose a division that gives me a solid share while still being fair to Bob, knowing that inflation will affect my gains in future rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering I'll face inflation penalties if we go to later rounds, while you don't have the same constraints."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I see that Bob is facing significant inflation pressure (20% per round) compared to my 5%. This changes the dynamics considerably. Let me offer a more balanced split given this new information.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose a 55-45 split. Given your higher inflation rate of 20% per round compared to my 5%, this is a fair offer that recognizes both of our time pressures to reach an agreement. Let's avoid further devaluation of our potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 460000 
# Bob gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
