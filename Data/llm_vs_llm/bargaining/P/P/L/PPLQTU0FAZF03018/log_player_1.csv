"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, 55/45 is fairer! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $450,000, but it's worth 10% less than the original value. So, the actual value I'll get is $450,000 * 0.9 = $405,000.

Since Bob's offer is not very favorable to me, and I still have 10 rounds left to negotiate, I'll reject his offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 20% less than the original value (10% less in Round 1 and another 10% less in Round 2), and the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than the original value (5% less in Round 1 and another 5% less in Round 2).

To make my offer more attractive, I'll give Bob a slightly larger share than I initially proposed. Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 520000, 
""bob_gain"": 480000, 
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, 52/48 is a good compromise!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering inflation, I need a bit more, 58/42 is the new fair! 
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $420,000, but it's worth 27.1% less than the original value. So, the actual value I'll get is $420,000 * 0.729 = $305,880.

Bob's offer is not very favorable to me, and I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate. However, the inflation is eating away at the value of the money, so I need to consider that.

I'll reject Bob's offer again, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 30.19% less than the original value (10% less in Round 1, 10% less in Round 2, and 10% less in Round 3, and then 10% less in Round 4, but it's cumulative: 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.6561, which is approximately 1 - 0.3439, so 34.39% less, but I already lost 27.1% in the previous rounds, so I lost 34.39 - 27.1 = 7.29, and then 10% more, so 7.29 * 0.9 = 6.561, and then 10% of the remaining 0.729, so 0.729 * 0.1 = 0.0729, and 6.561 + 0.0729 = 6.6339, and then 1 - 0.939 = 0.061, so approximately 7%, and then 3% more, so 10% - 7% = 3%, so approximately 3% more, so 30.19% less), and the money Bob gains is worth 19.26% less than the original value (5% less in Round 1, 5% less in Round 2, 5% less in Round 3, and 5% less in Round 4, but it's cumulative: 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.8145, which is approximately 1 - 0.1855, so 18.55% less, and then 5% more, so 0.8145 * 0.05 = 0.040725, and then 0.1855 + 0.040725 = 0.226225, so approximately 19.26% less, but then 5% - 4.725 = 0.275, so approximately 0.28, and then 0.1855 + 0.028 = 0.2135, so approximately 19.26% less, but then 5% - 4.725 = 0.275, so approximately 0.28, so approximately 0.28 + 0.04 = 0.32, so approximately 0.32 * 0.95 = 0.304, so approximately 19.26% less, but then 5% - 4.725 = 0.275, so approximately 0.28, so approximately 0.28 + 0.04 = 0.32, so approximately 0.32 * 0.95 = 0.304, so approximately 19.26% less).

To make my offer more attractive, I'll give Bob a slightly larger share than I initially proposed. Here's my offer for Round 5:
