4000.0,6000.0,"Hi Alice, since the money loses 5% value for you each round but not for me, a 50-50 split actually favors me over time. I'm proposing a 60-40 split which is fair considering you face depreciation. This way we can reach an agreement now and both benefit.",Bob,2,

4750.0,5250.0,"Bob, given the depreciation on my side, I'm willing to adjust my offer. A 47.5-52.5 split seems reasonable now, considering the loss in value I'm facing. Let's settle this and move forward.",Alice,3,
