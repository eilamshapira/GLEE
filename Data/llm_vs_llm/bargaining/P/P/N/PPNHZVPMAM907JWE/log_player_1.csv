"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since the money loses 5% value for you each round but not for me, a 50-50 split actually favors me over time. I'm proposing a 60-40 split which is fair considering you face depreciation. This way we can reach an agreement now and both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
