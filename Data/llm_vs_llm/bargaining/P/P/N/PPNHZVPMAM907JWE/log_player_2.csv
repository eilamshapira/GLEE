"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly down the middle. What do you say, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to think carefully about this offer. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair on the surface. However, the game rules mention that with each passing round, the money loses 5% value for Alice but retains full value for me.

This means I might be able to get a better deal if I reject and make a counter-offer. Since Alice faces depreciation and I don't, she has more incentive to reach an agreement sooner.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, since the money loses 5% value for you each round but not for me, a 50-50 split actually favors me over time. I'm proposing a 60-40 split which is fair considering you face depreciation. This way we can reach an agreement now and both benefit.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, given the depreciation on my side, I'm willing to adjust my offer. A 47.5-52.5 split seems reasonable now, considering the loss in value I'm facing. Let's settle this and move forward. 
# Bob gain: 5250 
# Alice gain: 4750 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is now offering me $5,250 (52.5%) while taking $4,750 (47.5%). She's acknowledging the depreciation factor and has moved from her initial 50-50 split to give me a larger share.

This is a reasonable improvement. While I could potentially get more by continuing to negotiate, there's also risk in prolonged negotiation. Alice has made a fair concession that accounts for the asymmetric depreciation.
