"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering me $4000 while taking $6000 for herself. This is a 40/60 split, which isn't equal. However, I need to consider that if I reject and move to the next round, the total value decreases by 5% for me due to inflation. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer, but the $10,000 will be worth only $9,500 to me.

Let me think: If I make a more favorable proposal next round, Alice might reject it, leading to further rounds and more value lost to inflation. A bird in hand is sometimes worth two in the bush.
