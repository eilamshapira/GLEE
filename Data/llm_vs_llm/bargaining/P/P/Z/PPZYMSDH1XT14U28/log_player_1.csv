Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000,""bob_gain"": 400000,""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly to start us off. I hope we can reach an agreement.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I think a 50-50 split would be the fairest solution for both of us. This way we both walk away with an equal share. Since there's no inflation for me, I'm comfortable continuing the negotiation if needed, but I hope we can agree on this fair division. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
