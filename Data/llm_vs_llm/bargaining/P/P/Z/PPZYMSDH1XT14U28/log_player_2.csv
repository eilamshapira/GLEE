"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly to start us off. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer gives me $400,000 while she would get $600,000. While I appreciate her proposal to start with, this isn't an equal split. Since there's no inflation for me, I have no urgency to accept an uneven division, and I can make a counter-proposal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Hello Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I think a 50-50 split would be the fairest solution for both of us. This way we both walk away with an equal share. Since there's no inflation for me, I'm comfortable continuing the negotiation if needed, but I hope we can agree on this fair division.""}"
