"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob that considers the inflation effect on my end.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor since I face a 20% inflation penalty for each passing round. If we don't agree now, the total value decreases for me. This is a fair offer considering that constraint.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly at 50/50. This way, both of us can avoid further penalties and achieve a fair outcome. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
