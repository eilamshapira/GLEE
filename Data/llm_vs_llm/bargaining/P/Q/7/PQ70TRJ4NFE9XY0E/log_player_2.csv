"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor since I face a 20% inflation penalty for each passing round. If we don't agree now, the total value decreases for me. This is a fair offer considering that constraint. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
