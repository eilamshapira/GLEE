"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Current offer: I get $40, Alice gets $60
2. If I reject, I can make an offer next round
3. However, due to 20% inflation, any money I get next round will be worth 20% less to me
4. If I reject, my $40 would effectively become worth $32 next round

Even though the split isn't entirely equal, accepting $40 now is better than risking further negotiations where inflation will reduce my purchasing power. If I reject, I'd need to secure significantly more than $50 in the next round just to break even after inflation.
