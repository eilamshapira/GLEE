"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

1. The offer is $150,000 for me and $850,000 for Alice
2. This is only round 1 of potentially 12 rounds
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
4. However, inflation will reduce my money's value by 20% each round
5. $150,000 now is better than a larger sum several rounds later that's heavily affected by inflation
6. But this offer gives Alice 85% of the total, which seems quite unfair

I'll reject this offer since it's too unbalanced and it's early in the game. I can make a more reasonable counter-offer next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer, but keeping in mind that Alice needs a meaningful incentive to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because:
1. It's closer to a fair 50-50 division
2. I'm giving Alice a substantial amount ($450,000)
3. If Alice rejects, the next round will have 20% inflation for me, making future gains less valuable
4. While I'm asking for slightly more than half, it's not so greedy that it should trigger an automatic rejection"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 666667 
# Alice gain: 333333 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $666,667, but due to 36% inflation, it's effectively worth:
   $666,667 * (1 - 0.36) = $426,667 in round 1 value

2. This is actually a pretty good offer considering:
   - It's much better than the initial $150,000 offer
   - The nominal amount is about 2/3 of the total
   - Even with inflation, the effective value is still substantial
   - Waiting more rounds will only increase my inflation penalty

3. If I reject, my next offer will be subject to even more inflation (likely around 50% less value in round 4)

Given these factors, this is actually a good offer for me. The inflation effect makes it important to accept a good offer when it comes, and this one is quite reasonable.
