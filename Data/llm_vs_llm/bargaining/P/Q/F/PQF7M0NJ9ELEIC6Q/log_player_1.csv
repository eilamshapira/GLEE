"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split since it's the first round, but considering inflation will affect my gains in future rounds, I'll ask for a slightly higher amount.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose a 55-45 split where I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000. This is a reasonable first offer that gives both of us a substantial amount while accounting for potential future inflation risk on my side."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
* If I accept this offer now, I'll get $450,000 but it's worth 20% less due to inflation, so effectively $360,000
* If I reject, we go to next round where I can make a new offer, but my gains will be worth another 20% less
* Bob's current offer is somewhat fair (45-55 split) given we're early in the game
* Waiting longer will only decrease my purchasing power more significantly

Given these factors, I'll accept this offer. Getting $360,000 in effective value now is better than risking further devaluation.
