"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice's offer gives me $30, I should consider inflation. If I reject and move to the next round, the total money will be worth 10% less to me, but only 5% less to Alice. I need to factor this in.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to make a reasonable offer that Alice will accept, considering that she faces 5% inflation per round while I face 10% inflation. If we continue to another round, it hurts me more than it hurts her.

{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55}

I propose a more balanced split where I get $45 and Alice gets $55. This is more favorable than her initial offer, but still gives her the majority share. Considering the inflation asymmetry, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement now rather than continue to another round."
