"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

Let me propose a 60-40 split in my favor, given that I need to account for the 5% inflation penalty per round if negotiations extend."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer since I can still make a better counter-proposal in the next round, even accounting for the 5% inflation penalty."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}

I'm offering a more balanced split now, considering that my gains are worth 10% less than in round 1 due to inflation. This is a reasonable compromise that should be attractive to Bob while still being worthwhile for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer. Even with the increasing inflation penalty, I can still make a better counter-proposal in the next round that would give me more value than accepting $4200 now."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split now. Even though my gains are worth about 19% less due to inflation at this point, a perfectly equal split is a fair compromise that Bob should seriously consider accepting. Going further with negotiations would mean even more value lost to inflation for me, while Bob has nothing to lose from time passing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. With the mounting inflation penalty (22.62%), if I reject this and continue negotiating, my effective gains will keep decreasing. $4000 now is worth more than potentially getting a higher nominal amount in future rounds where the inflation penalty would be even greater. Additionally, Bob seems committed to maintaining or increasing his position, so this is likely the best outcome I can achieve."
