"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. The current offer is $4000 for me and $6000 for Alice
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. However, due to inflation:
   * My money will be worth 20% less next round
   * Alice's money will be worth 10% less next round
4. So if I wait, my $4000 would effectively become worth $3200
5. This is a significant loss just to get another chance

While the split isn't entirely in my favor, the inflation penalty makes it risky to reject. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush, especially with such high inflation.
