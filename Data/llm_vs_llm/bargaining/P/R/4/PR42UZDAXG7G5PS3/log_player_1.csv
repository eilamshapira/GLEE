Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000,""bob_gain"": 400000,""message"":""Let's start with a fair split that gives us both a good amount.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given that the money is already worth 10% less for you and will depreciate another 10% if you reject, this is a fair offer that gives you $450000. We should conclude this now before further depreciation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
