"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split that gives us both a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice's offering me $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for herself
2. If I reject, we move to the next round where:
   * I can make an offer
   * But the money will be worth 5% less to me and 10% less to her
   * So $400,000 now vs. potentially more but worth less later

Since Alice is more affected by inflation (10% vs my 5%), I have some leverage in the next round. She might be more willing to accept a better offer for me rather than risk further depreciation. I could potentially get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since I'm making the offer now, I'll consider that:
1. The money is now worth 5% less to me and 10% less to Alice
2. If Alice rejects, we'll go to round 3 where she makes an offer, but the money will be worth even less
3. Alice should be motivated to accept now due to her higher inflation rate
4. I should still make a reasonable offer to increase chances of acceptance

""alice_gain"": 450000,
