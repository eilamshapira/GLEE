"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose a 50-50 split which is fair for both of us. Remember, while I face inflation penalties, we both lose everything if we don't agree within 12 rounds. This is a balanced offer that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
