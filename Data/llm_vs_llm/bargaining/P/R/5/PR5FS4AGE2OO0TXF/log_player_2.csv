"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal, Bob! I'm offering you a fair share. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $3000 out of $10000
2. If I reject, and we move to next round, my money will be worth 20% less
3. $3000 now is better than potentially getting $4000 next round (which would be worth $3200 due to inflation)
4. Alice seems to be taking advantage of my inflation penalty

However, I can try to negotiate for a better deal since this first offer is quite low, and the 20% penalty isn't too severe yet. I'll reject and propose a more equitable split in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split, acknowledging both the inflation factor and the need for fairness:

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, I propose a 50-50 split which is fair for both of us. Remember, while I face inflation penalties, we both lose everything if we don't agree within 12 rounds. This is a balanced offer that benefits us both.""}"
