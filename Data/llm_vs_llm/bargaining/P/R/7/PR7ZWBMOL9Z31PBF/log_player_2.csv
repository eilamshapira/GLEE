"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is far too uneven. Since I can make a counter-proposal in the next round, I'll reject this heavily skewed distribution. Even with the 10% inflation penalty for the next round, I can propose a more balanced split that would be better for me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I propose a fair 50-50 split. While I could try to take advantage of my position as the proposer, a fair split is more likely to be accepted by Alice. If she rejects this offer, we'll move to round 3 where she can make a new proposal, but I'll lose 10% value. This fair split should be appealing enough for her to accept, allowing us both to walk away with a reasonable amount."
