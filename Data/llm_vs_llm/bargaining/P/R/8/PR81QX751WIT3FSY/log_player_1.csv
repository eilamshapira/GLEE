"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I suggest a fair 60-40 split. This gives you a substantial $400,000, and if you decline, remember that inflation will reduce the value for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation rates, I believe this 55-45 split is more reasonable. If you decline, your share will be worth 20% less in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $450,000 (but worth 20% less than initial value = $360,000 effective value)
- If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
  * The total money will be worth even less (40% less for me, 10% less for Bob)
  * I might end up with less effective value
  * Bob might reject again, making it even worse

Given the asymmetric inflation rates (20% vs 5%), delaying is especially costly for me. Bob's offer, while not ideal, gives me a reasonable amount considering the circumstances.
