Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I suggest a fair 60-40 split, considering that you lose more value than me with each round. This way we both get a good amount right away without risking depreciation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the inflation rates, I believe this split is more balanced and fair for both of us. Let's settle this round to maximize our gains. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll wait for my turn to make a counter-offer, as I believe we can reach a better agreement given the inflation dynamics."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle at 55-45. With inflation affecting you more severely (20% vs my 10%), further delays will hurt both of us, but you more significantly. This is a balanced compromise.""}"
