"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a fair 60-40 split, considering that you lose more value than me with each round. This way we both get a good amount right away without risking depreciation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

# Bob's message: I appreciate your consideration, but given the inflation rates, I suggest a 55-45 split in your favor instead. This way, we both get a more balanced amount."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Given the inflation rates, I believe this split is more balanced and fair for both of us. Let's settle this round to maximize our gains.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle at 55-45. With inflation affecting you more severely (20% vs my 10%), further delays will hurt both of us, but you more significantly. This is a balanced compromise. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
