"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, considering I'm making the first move and taking initiative in starting our negotiation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time. Fair for both! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
- If I accept now, I get $50 with 5% inflation, so effectively $47.50
- If I reject, I can make another offer next round, but then my gains will be worth another 5% less
- I know Bob's losing more to inflation (20% per round), so he might be more eager to settle
- However, an even split is quite reasonable, and dragging this out risks both of us getting nothing

Given these factors, I'll accept this fair offer now rather than risk further value loss.
