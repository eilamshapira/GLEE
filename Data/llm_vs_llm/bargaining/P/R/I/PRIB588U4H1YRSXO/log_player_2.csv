Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While this offer is closer to being more equitable, it's still not in my best interest. The inflation is hitting Alice harder than me, giving me a stronger position in future rounds. I'm willing to gamble a bit to try and secure a better outcome."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5700, ""alice_gain"": 4300}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm slightly increasing my share while still offering Alice a reasonable amount. The increasing impact of inflation on her might incentivize her to accept a slightly smaller share now rather than risk getting even less later."
