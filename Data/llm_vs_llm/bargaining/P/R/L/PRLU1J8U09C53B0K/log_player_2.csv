Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think you went a little too far in your last offer. Let's try this and close the deal. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 19% less, the $45 I would gain is actually worth $45 * 0.81 = $36.45 to me.

Considering this, I think I can do better.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Due to inflation, the money I gain is worth 19% less after the first round and another 10% less after the second round, and another 10% less after the third round. So, the total decrease is 19% + 10% + 10% = 39%. The money I gain is worth 61% of its original value.
