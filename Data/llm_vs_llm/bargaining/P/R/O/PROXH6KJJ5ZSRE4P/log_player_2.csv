"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split, let's end this quickly before inflation hits 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering a 60-40 split where she gets $6,000 and I get $4,000. While this isn't an even split, I need to factor in the 20% inflation penalty per round. If I reject and make a counter-offer, the total value will already be decreased by 20%.

Let's evaluate: If I reject, the $10,000 becomes worth $8,000 for me in the next round. Even if I could get a 50-50 split next round ($4,000), that would be worth less than the $4,000 I'm being offered now.

Given the inflation penalty and the risk of further rounds reducing the total value, this offer is reasonable.
