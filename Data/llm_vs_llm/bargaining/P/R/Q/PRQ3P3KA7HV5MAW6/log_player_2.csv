"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer:

Alice is proposing a 50/50 split where I get $50 and she gets $50. This is a perfectly equal division.

Since there's no inflation for me (0% inflation means the money retains its value over rounds), there's no particular advantage to accepting immediately versus negotiating further. However, a 50/50 split is generally considered fair, and there's no guarantee I would get a better deal in later rounds.

Given that this is a fair offer and there's no strategic advantage to delaying, I'll accept.
