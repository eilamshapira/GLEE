"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the increasing impact of inflation, especially on your side, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This still leaves you with a significant portion while acknowledging the faster devaluation of money for you. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The reasoning is: Due to inflation, if I reject and we go to the next round, my money will be worth 20% less, while Bob's only 10% less. My $45 now is worth more than even a $60 share would be worth in the next round (as that would be reduced by 20% to an effective value of $48). It's better to accept this reasonable offer now than risk further devaluation."
