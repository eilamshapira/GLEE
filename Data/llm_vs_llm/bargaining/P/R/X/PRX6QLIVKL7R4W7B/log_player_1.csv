"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer that takes into account the inflation asymmetry while being reasonable for both sides.

{""alice_gain"": 525000, 
""bob_gain"": 475000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that slightly favors me since you face 5% inflation per round while I don't. If we keep going back and forth, your purchasing power decreases. This deal gives you $475,000 right now, which is better than waiting and losing value. Let's agree and both walk away with substantial amounts.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but considering the impact of inflation on me, I think a fair split would be an even division. This way, we both get an equal share, and I can minimize the loss from inflation. Let's settle for this and avoid further rounds which will decrease my purchasing power. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counterproposal, but let's consider the game theory here. Due to the 5% inflation that only affects you, your $500,000 in round 4 would be worth only $427,500 in real value (after two more rounds of 5% inflation). My offer of $450,000 now gives you more actual value than if we continue negotiating. This split acknowledges the asymmetric inflation while still giving you a substantial portion. Let's conclude this now to maximize your purchasing power.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see your point. Due to inflation, I need to get a reasonable amount before my share becomes worthless. Let's still try to keep it fair. I'm proposing the same split you proposed in the first round. This way, we can both walk away with a decent amount, and I can minimize my losses from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000
