"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that slightly favors me since you face 5% inflation per round while I don't. If we keep going back and forth, your purchasing power decreases. This deal gives you $475000 right now, which is better than waiting and losing value. Let's agree and both walk away with substantial amounts. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but considering the impact of inflation on me, I think a fair split would be an even division. This way, we both get an equal share, and I can minimize the loss from inflation. Let's settle for this and avoid further rounds which will decrease my purchasing power.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counterproposal, but let's consider the game theory here. Due to the 5% inflation that only affects you, your $500000 in round 4 would be worth only $427500 in real value (after two more rounds of 5% inflation). My offer of $450000 now gives you more actual value than if we continue negotiating. This split acknowledges the asymmetric inflation while still giving you a substantial portion. Let's conclude this now to maximize your purchasing power. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 475000, ""alice_gain"": 525000, ""message"": ""Alice, I see your point. Due to inflation, I need to get a reasonable amount before my share becomes worthless. Let's still try to keep it fair. I'm proposing the same split you proposed in the first round. This way, we can both walk away with a decent amount, and I can minimize my losses from inflation.""}"
