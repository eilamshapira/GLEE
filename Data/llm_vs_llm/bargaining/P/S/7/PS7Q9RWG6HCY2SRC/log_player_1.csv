"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my initial offer to divide the $1,000,000. Since we're facing different inflation rates (5% for me, 10% for Bob), I should consider an offer that recognizes both our interests in completing the deal sooner rather than later.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose an even split of $500,000 each. This is a fair starting point that respects both our interests equally. We both benefit from resolving this quickly due to the inflation penalties."
