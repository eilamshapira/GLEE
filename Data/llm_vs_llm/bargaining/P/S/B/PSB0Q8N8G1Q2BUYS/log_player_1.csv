"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation:

*   **My gain in Round 1:** $6000, worth $6000
*   **Bob's gain in Round 1:** $4000, worth $4000

Now, let's look at the offer:

*   **Alice's gain in Round 2 (Proposed):** $4500. The value is: $4500 * 0.90 = $4050 (due to 10% inflation for me).
*   **Bob's gain in Round 2 (Proposed):** $5500. The value is: $5500 * 0.80 = $4400 (due to 20% inflation for Bob).

Comparing to the implicit ""original"" proposal:

*   **Alice's real gain:** $6000
*   **Bob's real gain:** $4000

Now comparing Alice's value:

*   **Acceptance Value:** $4050
*   **Rejection Value (what I got in Round 1):** $6000
*   **Conclusion**: $4050 < $6000, so I would reject.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 3, taking into account the ongoing inflation. I want to secure a better deal for myself.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this with the inflation factored in.

*   **Alice's real gain in Round 1**: 6000
*   **Bob's real gain in Round 1**: 4000

Now, for the current round:

*   **Alice's gain in Round 4 (Proposed):** $4000. The value is: $4000 * (1-0.271) = $4000 * 0.729 = $2916.
*   **Bob's gain in Round 4 (Proposed):** $6000. The value is: $6000 * (1-0.488) = $6000 * 0.512 = $3072.

Comparing:

*   **My gain (accept):** $2916
*   **My best previous gain (6000):** $6000

Because 2916 < 6000, I must reject the offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here is my offer for Round 5:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500
}
```"
