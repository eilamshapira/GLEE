"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that favors me slightly since I'll lose less value per round (10% vs your 20%). If we drag this out, we both lose significantly. This gives you $450000 now rather than waiting and losing more value. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice's logic about the differential inflation rates is valid
2. If I reject, the next round my $450K would be worth 20% less (=$360K)
3. Even if I counter-offer for more, Alice might reject, leading to further losses
4. The split is relatively fair considering the circumstances
5. Getting $450K immediately is better than risking a drawn-out negotiation
