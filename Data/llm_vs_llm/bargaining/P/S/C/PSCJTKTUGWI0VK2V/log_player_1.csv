"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer that considers both our interests and the inflation rates.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose a slightly larger share for myself since inflation affects me more severely (20% vs 10% per round). This division is fair while acknowledging our different inflation rates, and accepting now gives us both more total value than if we continue to later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer. While I'm getting slightly less than half, the 20% inflation penalty for me means that if I reject and make a counteroffer in round 3, the entire pot would be worth significantly less to me. This offer gives me $4800, which is better than risking another round of severe inflation. The difference between our shares is reasonable given the circumstances."
