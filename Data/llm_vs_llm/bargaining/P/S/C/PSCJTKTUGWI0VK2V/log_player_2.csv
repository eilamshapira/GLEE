"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Current value: $4,500 for me
2. If I reject, next round I can make an offer, but:
   * My money will be worth 10% less
   * Alice's money will be worth 20% less
   * This gives me some negotiating leverage

The offer isn't terrible, but I think I can get a better deal. Since Alice's money devalues faster than mine (20% vs 10%), she'll be more motivated to accept a reasonable counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice's money devalues faster than mine (20% vs 10%), I'll propose a slightly better deal for myself, but still fair enough that she should accept rather than risk another round of devaluation.

{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800}

I think this is reasonable because:
1. If Alice rejects, her share will be worth 20% less next round
2. While my share would only be worth 10% less
3. The split is still relatively balanced, giving her a significant portion
4. She should prefer getting $4,800 now rather than risk further devaluation"
