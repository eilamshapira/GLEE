Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"":80,""bob_gain"":20,""message"":""Let's start with a fair split. I receive 80% and you get 20%. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer seems heavily skewed in your favor.  Let's be reasonable. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This accounts for the risk I'm taking by letting the money devalue further. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
