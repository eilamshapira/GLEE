60.0,40.0,"Bob, let's start with a fair offer! I propose 60 for me and 40 for you. This gives us both a good starting point considering the looming inflation. Let's agree now and avoid losing value!",Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Let's be realistic, Alice. Since we've already lost some value due to inflation, I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal than a straight 50/50. However, I expect us to come to an agreement soon to maximize our gains.",Bob,2,

53.0,47.0,"Bob, inflation is hurting us both! I'll meet you in the middle of our previous offers. I propose 53 for me and 47 for you. This is a significant concession on my part. Let's take it before we lose even more!",Alice,3,

48.0,52.0,"Alice, I appreciate your concession, but I think we can do better. Considering the inflation, I'm willing to take a slightly larger share to account for the lost value. Let's agree on this before it's too late.",Bob,4,

51.0,49.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Inflation is eating away at our potential gains. I'm offering 51 for me and 49 for you. This is very close to 50/50. We are wasting time. Accept this, and we both walk away with something.",Alice,5,
