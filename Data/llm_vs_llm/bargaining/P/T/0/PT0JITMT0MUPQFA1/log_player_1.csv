"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer that is fair considering the inflation I face. Since I'm Alice and I have a 10% inflation rate per round, I should aim for a favorable first-round offer.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose this split because we both deserve a substantial portion, but the inflation affects me more than Bob, so I'm asking for slightly more to account for this disadvantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I see that Bob is being quite aggressive with his offer. Let me propose a more reasonable split that accounts for the inflation I face while being fair to both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing an equal split, which is fair for both parties. Since I face a 10% inflation penalty each round, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon rather than prolonging negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","I see that Bob is gradually improving his offers but still trying to take advantage of my inflation penalty. Let me propose a more balanced offer that reflects our current situation.

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}

I'm offering you the larger share now, Bob, recognizing that inflation is affecting my gains. This is a fair compromise that benefits us both and prevents further rounds of negotiation that would only reduce the value of my share even more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","I see that Bob is not negotiating in good faith. Let me try a different approach that highlights the urgency of reaching an agreement due to the increasing inflation I face.

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60}

Bob, I'm offering you a substantial 60% of the money. My share is already worth significantly less due to inflation (over 40% less valuable for me now), and further delays only hurt us both. This is a reasonable compromise that acknowledges your stronger position while still giving me a fair portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","I see that Bob is consistently offering me nothing, which isn't a reasonable negotiation strategy. Let me make one more serious attempt at a fair division.

{""alice_gain"": 35, ""bob_gain"": 65}

Bob, I'm now offering you 65% of the total amount. With each passing round, my share becomes less valuable due to inflation, while yours remains the same. At this point, my $35 would be worth less than $17 in original value terms. This is a very generous offer given the circumstances, and I hope you'll accept it so we can both walk away with something rather than nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","I see that Bob is committed to a strategy of offering me nothing, hoping I'll eventually accept due to the inflation pressure. Let me make a final rational offer.

{""alice_gain"": 30, ""bob_gain"": 70}

Bob, I'm now offering you 70% of the total amount. We have only one round left after this, and if we don't agree, we both get nothing. My $30 would only be worth about $10 in original value terms due to the severe inflation I face. This is an extremely generous offer that gives you the vast majority of the money while still allowing me to walk away with something. Please consider accepting this reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 68.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 0.01 
# Bob gain: 99.99
