"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a division that accounts for Bob's time pressure due to the 10% inflation penalty he faces each round. Since I don't face inflation, I can afford to be patient, but I'll still make a reasonable first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this 60-40 split because while I have the advantage of no inflation penalty, I still want to make an offer that Bob might reasonably accept to avoid losing value in future rounds."
