"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a fair split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first move. This way we both get a good amount without risking inflation losses. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice's offer is relatively fair, giving me 48% of the total amount. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but:

1. The total amount will be worth 5% less (9,500$ total)
2. Alice could then reject my offer, leading to further rounds and more value loss
3. The current split gives me 4,800$, which is a substantial amount

While I could try to negotiate for a more equal split, the risk of losing value through inflation makes this offer quite reasonable. The 400$ difference isn't worth the risk of losing more through inflation in subsequent rounds.
