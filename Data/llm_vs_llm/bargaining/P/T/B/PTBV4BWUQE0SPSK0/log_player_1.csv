"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fairly generous split since Bob has no time pressure (no inflation for him) and could afford to wait.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

This is a fair offer giving me a slightly larger share while still being quite reasonable for Bob. If he rejects, my next opportunity will be worth less due to inflation."
