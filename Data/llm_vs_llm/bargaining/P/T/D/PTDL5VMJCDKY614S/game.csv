5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose a 50/50 split of the $10000. Given the inflation factor that reduces the value for me with each round, it seems wise for both of us to settle now and secure our full value. I believe an equal division is fair and expedient. What do you think?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Hi Alice, while I appreciate the 50/50 offer, considering the inflation, I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more suitable. This way, we both still get a good deal. What do you say?",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'd prefer to hold off on accepting this division. Considering that the money keeps losing value for me by 5% each round (and you by 20%), I'm confident that if we negotiate again in the next round where I propose the division, we can craft a deal that gives us both a better outcome overall. Let's continue this negotiation.",Alice,2,reject
4200.0,5800.0,"Hi Bob, with each round my share loses an additional 5% of its value and I’d like to avoid further losses. I propose a division where I receive $4200 and you receive $5800. This proposal accounts for my accelerated devaluation while still offering you a strong share. Let’s secure our interests now rather than risk further decline—I'd be glad to finalize this deal together.",Alice,3,

3500.0,6500.0,"Alice, I understand your position and how the inflation is impacting you.  However, I'm also feeling the effects on my end.  Let's make this work - I propose a 65/35 split. This provides a substantial amount for both of us and avoids further losses.",Bob,4,
,,"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. However, with the current inflation, the effective value for me comes out to roughly $3000 in today’s dollars, which is below what I was aiming for. I believe there's still room to improve both our outcomes if we continue negotiating. Let’s move to the next round and see if we can craft a division that better reflects our respective devaluations.",Alice,4,reject
4700.0,5300.0,"Hi Bob, as we move into round 5 my share is now worth only about 81.45% of its original value – meaning further delay will cost us both even more. To safeguard our interests before any additional losses occur, I propose a division where I receive $4700 and you get $5300. This split helps me retain an effective value comparable to earlier rounds while still providing you with a strong portion. I believe this is a fair compromise given the current devaluation for me, and I hope we can finalize this deal now to avoid further erosion of value for both sides.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
3200.0,6800.0,"Alice, we're getting close to the wire here. I understand your concerns about the inflation, but it's affecting us both. Let's be decisive: I propose a 68/32 split. This gives us both a reasonable share considering the circumstances and avoids the risk of walking away with nothing.",Bob,6,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your push to close the deal, especially as we both face dwindling values due to inflation. However, a 68/32 split leaves me with an effective value that's significantly less than what I need to justify immediate acceptance. Given that my share is now worth 22.62% less while yours is devalued even more, I was aiming for a division that better offsets my losses. I’m not ready to settle on this offer and would like to propose a revised split in the next round that accounts more fairly for the rapid depreciation on my end. Let's keep negotiating and find a middle ground that we can both agree on.",Alice,6,reject
3400.0,6600.0,"Hi Bob, as we enter round 7 the pressure of inflation is mounting even more, especially on my side. To avoid further devaluation and the risk that we walk away with nothing, I’d like to settle now. I propose a division where I receive $3400 and you receive $6600. This offer reflects a modest shift toward you given the overall devaluation, but it helps me secure a better outcome than waiting further. I hope we can agree that locking in our shares now is in both our interests. What do you say?",Alice,7,
