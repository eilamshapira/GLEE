Given the inflation factor that reduces the value for me with each round, it seems wise for both of us to settle now and secure our full value. I believe an equal division is fair and expedient. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, while I appreciate the 50/50 offer, considering the inflation, I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more suitable. This way, we both still get a good deal. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'd prefer to hold off on accepting this division. Considering that the money keeps losing value for me by 5% each round (and you by 20%), I'm confident that if we negotiate again in the next round where I propose the division, we can craft a deal that gives us both a better outcome overall. Let's continue this negotiation.""}"

I propose a division where I receive $4,200 and you receive $5,800. This proposal accounts for my accelerated devaluation while still offering you a strong share. Let’s secure our interests now rather than risk further decline—I'd be glad to finalize this deal together.""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position and how the inflation is impacting you.  However, I'm also feeling the effects on my end.  Let's make this work - I propose a 65/35 split. This provides a substantial amount for both of us and avoids further losses. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. However, with the current inflation, the effective value for me comes out to roughly $3,000 in today’s dollars, which is below what I was aiming for. I believe there's still room to improve both our outcomes if we continue negotiating. Let’s move to the next round and see if we can craft a division that better reflects our respective devaluations.""}"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 4700, ""bob_gain"": 5300, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, as we move into round 5 my share is now worth only about 81.45% of its original value – meaning further delay will cost us both even more. To safeguard our interests before any additional losses occur, I propose a division where I receive $4,700 and you get $5,300. This split helps me retain an effective value comparable to earlier rounds while still providing you with a strong portion. I believe this is a fair compromise given the current devaluation for me, and I hope we can finalize this deal now to avoid further erosion of value for both sides.""}"

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close to the wire here. I understand your concerns about the inflation, but it's affecting us both. Let's be decisive: I propose a 68/32 split. This gives us both a reasonable share considering the circumstances and avoids the risk of walking away with nothing. 
# Alice gain: 3200 
# Bob gain: 6800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your push to close the deal, especially as we both face dwindling values due to inflation. However, a 68/32 split leaves me with an effective value that's significantly less than what I need to justify immediate acceptance. Given that my share is now worth 22.62% less while yours is devalued even more, I was aiming for a division that better offsets my losses. I’m not ready to settle on this offer and would like to propose a revised split in the next round that accounts more fairly for the rapid depreciation on my end. Let's keep negotiating and find a middle ground that we can both agree on.""}"

To avoid further devaluation and the risk that we walk away with nothing, I’d like to settle now. I propose a division where I receive $3,400 and you receive $6,600. This offer reflects a modest shift toward you given the overall devaluation, but it helps me secure a better outcome than waiting further. I hope we can agree that locking in our shares now is in both our interests. What do you say?""}"
