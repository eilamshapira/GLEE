"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a 50/50 split of the $10000. Given the inflation factor that reduces the value for me with each round, it seems wise for both of us to settle now and secure our full value. I believe an equal division is fair and expedient. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, while I appreciate the 50/50 offer, considering the inflation, I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more suitable. This way, we both still get a good deal. What do you say?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, with each round my share loses an additional 5% of its value and I’d like to avoid further losses. I propose a division where I receive $4200 and you receive $5800. This proposal accounts for my accelerated devaluation while still offering you a strong share. Let’s secure our interests now rather than risk further decline—I'd be glad to finalize this deal together. 
# Bob gain: 5800 
# Alice gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation more than I am.  While her offer isn't terrible, I'm going to push my luck a bit further and hope she becomes more agreeable to a larger gap in the split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position and how the inflation is impacting you.  However, I'm also feeling the effects on my end.  Let's make this work - I propose a 65/35 split. This provides a substantial amount for both of us and avoids further losses.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, as we move into round 5 my share is now worth only about 81.45% of its original value – meaning further delay will cost us both even more. To safeguard our interests before any additional losses occur, I propose a division where I receive $4700 and you get $5300. This split helps me retain an effective value comparable to earlier rounds while still providing you with a strong portion. I believe this is a fair compromise given the current devaluation for me, and I hope we can finalize this deal now to avoid further erosion of value for both sides. 
# Bob gain: 5300 
# Alice gain: 4700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly very uncomfortable with the inflation, and her offers are steadily moving in my favor. While she's anchoring her proposals around minimizing her own losses, my losses are proportionally greater with each round. I believe I can push for a slightly better deal still."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6800, ""alice_gain"": 3200, ""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close to the wire here. I understand your concerns about the inflation, but it's affecting us both. Let's be decisive: I propose a 68/32 split. This gives us both a reasonable share considering the circumstances and avoids the risk of walking away with nothing.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, as we enter round 7 the pressure of inflation is mounting even more, especially on my side. To avoid further devaluation and the risk that we walk away with nothing, I’d like to settle now. I propose a division where I receive $3400 and you receive $6600. This offer reflects a modest shift toward you given the overall devaluation, but it helps me secure a better outcome than waiting further. I hope we can agree that locking in our shares now is in both our interests. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 6600 
# Alice gain: 3400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** 

This offer is now firmly in a range that is advantageous to me, even considering the inflation. Alice is clearly very motivated to settle due to her own devaluation rate. While I *might* be able to squeeze out a tiny bit more, the risk of losing everything is starting to outweigh the potential reward."
