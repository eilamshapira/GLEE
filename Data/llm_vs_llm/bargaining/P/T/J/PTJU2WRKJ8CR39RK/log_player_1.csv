"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to factor in the inflation and my current situation.

*   **My Perspective (Alice):** The initial $1,000,000 is now worth 80% of its original value. My gain will be calculated based on that.

*   **My Offer:**
    *   Bob's offer: Alice gain: 450,000$, Bob gain: 550,000$
    *   Alice's Offer (after inflation): Alice gain: 450,000 * 0.8 = 360,000$, Bob gain: 550,000 * 0.95 = 522,500$

Based on my calculations, I will reject this offer.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Alright, it's my turn to propose again. Here's my offer for Round 3, keeping in mind the continued impact of inflation:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze Bob's offer, considering the accumulated inflation.

*   **My Perspective (Alice):** The initial $1,000,000 is now worth 51.2% of its original value (100% - 48.8%).

*   **Bob's Offer:**
    *   Bob's offer: Alice gain: 400,000$, Bob gain: 600,000$
    *   Alice's Offer (after inflation): Alice gain: 400,000 * 0.512 = 204,800$, Bob gain: 600,000 * 0.8574 = 514,440$

Considering the significant depreciation of the money's value for me, I will reject the offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, it's my turn to propose again in Round 5. The money continues to lose value for me. I need to make an offer that is both attractive to Bob and still beneficial for me.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 680000, ""bob_gain"": 320000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alright, let's analyze Bob's offer in Round 6. The value of the money continues to deteriorate for both of us, but especially for me.

*   **My Perspective (Alice):** The initial $1,000,000 is now worth 32.77% of its original value (100% - 67.23%).

*   **Bob's Offer:**
    *   Bob's offer: Alice gain: 350,000$, Bob gain: 650,000$
    *   Alice's Offer (after inflation): Alice gain: 350,000 * 0.3277 = 114,695$, Bob gain: 650,000 * 0.7738 = 503,970$

Considering the further devaluation of the money for me, I still will reject the offer. The amount I'd receive is too low.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, round 7. The pressure is on! I need to make an offer that is more likely to be accepted, given the diminishing value of the money. I will make an offer that is closer to an even split, but still slightly favors me.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```"
