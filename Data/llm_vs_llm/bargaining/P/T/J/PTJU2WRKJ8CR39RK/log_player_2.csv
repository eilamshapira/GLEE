"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to analyze this offer carefully.

Alice is offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000, which means she's proposing to take $600,000 for herself.

With the inflation rules, if I reject:
- In the next round, the money will be worth 5% less to me
- But it will be worth 20% less to Alice

So if I make a counter-offer, Alice will face a steeper inflation penalty than I will. This gives me negotiation leverage.

Since this is only round 1 of potentially 12 rounds, and I have a significant inflation advantage, I think I can secure a better deal by making a counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a strategic counter-offer that takes into account our different inflation rates.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I propose this division because it gives me a majority share while still leaving Alice with a substantial amount. Since Alice faces a steeper inflation penalty (20% per round vs my 5%), this offer should be attractive compared to continuing negotiations where her share would lose value more quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to analyze this carefully again.

Alice has actually offered me less than in round 1 ($350,000 vs $400,000 previously), while taking more for herself. This seems counterproductive given our inflation rates.

Current inflation effects:
- My money is worth 9.75% less than round 1
- Alice's money is worth 36% less than round 1

If I reject and we go to round 4:
- My inflation will increase further (to about 14.75%)
- Alice's inflation will increase much more significantly (to about 48.8%)

Alice's offer doesn't make sense given her higher inflation rate. I can make a better counter-offer in the next round that accounts for our different inflation positions.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given our inflation rates and negotiation history, I'll make a strategic offer that should be more appealing to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I'm proposing this division because Alice is experiencing much higher inflation (her money is already worth 36% less than in round 1, while mine is only 9.75% less). If negotiations continue, her position will weaken significantly with each round due to the 20% inflation she faces per round compared to my 5%. 

This offer gives her a substantial $400,000 which, even with her current inflation, is better than risking further rounds where her share would be worth even less. It's a fair offer considering our different inflation rates and the remaining rounds available."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 320000 
# Alice gain: 680000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate this offer.

Alice has offered me even less than before ($320,000 vs $350,000 in round 3), which is surprising given her much higher inflation rate.

Current inflation effects:
- My money is worth 18.55% less than round 1
- Alice's money is worth 59.04% less than round 1

If I reject and we go to round 6:
- My inflation will increase to approximately 23.55%
- Alice's inflation will increase to approximately 67.2%

Given Alice's extremely high inflation rate, her $680,000 would only be worth about $278,848 in round 1 value to her, while my $320,000 would be worth about $260,640 in round 1 value to me.

This offer still doesn't make sense given our inflation rates. Alice is acting against her own interests by continuing to ask for more despite her higher inflation penalty.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given the increasing inflation pressure on Alice and our negotiation history, I'll make a strategic offer:

{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000}

I'm proposing this division because Alice is now experiencing severe inflation (her money is worth 59.04% less than in round 1, while mine is only 18.55% less). If negotiations continue further, her position will deteriorate even more rapidly with each round due to her 20% inflation rate versus my 5%.

This offer gives her $350,000, which even with her current inflation is better than risking additional rounds where her share would be worth significantly less. At this point, the rational move for Alice is to accept a smaller nominal amount that has higher present value to her rather than continue negotiations where time works strongly against her interests."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is an interesting development. Alice has now significantly improved her offer to me, moving from $320,000 in round 5 to $450,000 now.

Current inflation effects:
- My money is worth 26.49% less than round 1
- Alice's money is worth 73.79% less than round 1

If I reject and we go to round 8:
- My inflation will increase to approximately 30.17%
- Alice's inflation will reach about 79.03%

With the current offer:
- My $450,000 is worth about $330,795 in round 1 value to me
- Alice's $550,000 is worth only about $144,155 in round 1 value to her

This is a much more reasonable offer given our inflation rates. While I could potentially get more by continuing negotiations (since Alice's inflation is so severe), there's also risk in further delays. Additionally, Alice has finally made a substantive move in my direction, which suggests she's beginning to recognize the inflation pressure.
