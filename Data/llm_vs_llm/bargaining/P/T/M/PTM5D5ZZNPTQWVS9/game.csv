6000.0,4000.0,Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor as I'm making the first move and taking initiative. This is a fair offer that gives us both a substantial amount.,Alice,1,

4099.0,5901.0,"Alice, I'd like to avoid further delay and the losses I incur from inflation. If you reject, you'll have the floor in round 3—and by a standard backward‐induction argument you would secure about $4099 nominally. To keep things fair and efficient, I'm offering you $4099 now, which matches your continuation value. Let’s settle this round and avoid further discounting.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6500.0,3500.0,"Bob, I noticed you understand game theory well, but there's a key point: inflation only affects your gains, not mine. A $3500 offer to you now is actually better than what you'd get if we delay further, as your purchasing power decreases each round. This is a fair offer considering our asymmetric inflation exposure.",Alice,3,
