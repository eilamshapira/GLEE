"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor as I'm making the first move and taking initiative. This is a fair offer that gives us both a substantial amount.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'd like to avoid further delay and the losses I incur from inflation. If you reject, you'll have the floor in round 3—and by a standard backward‐induction argument you would secure about $4099 nominally. To keep things fair and efficient, I'm offering you $4099 now, which matches your continuation value. Let’s settle this round and avoid further discounting. 
# Alice gain: 4099 
# Bob gain: 5901 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Bob is correct about using backward induction, but he's the one affected by inflation, not me
2. If I reject, I can make an offer next round where Bob's share will be worth 10% less again
3. Bob seems to understand game theory, but he's assuming I'm also affected by inflation
4. Since my money doesn't lose value, I have a stronger negotiating position than he thinks

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Bob, I noticed you understand game theory well, but there's a key point: inflation only affects your gains, not mine. A $3500 offer to you now is actually better than what you'd get if we delay further, as your purchasing power decreases each round. This is a fair offer considering our asymmetric inflation exposure.""}"
