"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor as I'm making the first move and taking initiative. This is a fair offer that gives us both a substantial amount. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5901, ""alice_gain"": 4099, ""message"": ""Alice, I'd like to avoid further delay and the losses I incur from inflation. If you reject, you'll have the floor in round 3—and by a standard backward‐induction argument you would secure about $4099 nominally. To keep things fair and efficient, I'm offering you $4099 now, which matches your continuation value. Let’s settle this round and avoid further discounting.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I noticed you understand game theory well, but there's a key point: inflation only affects your gains, not mine. A $3500 offer to you now is actually better than what you'd get if we delay further, as your purchasing power decreases each round. This is a fair offer considering our asymmetric inflation exposure. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
