"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically.

Alice is offering me $40 while taking $60. If I reject, we move to the next round where:
- I can make a counter-offer
- The money will be worth 5% less to me (so $100 becomes worth $95)
- The money will be worth 10% less to Alice (so $100 becomes worth $90)

Since Alice has a higher depreciation rate (10% vs my 5%), I have some leverage in the next round. I could potentially offer a more favorable split for myself, and Alice might be more inclined to accept due to the higher depreciation rate they face.

I'll reject this offer to try for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I should propose something that takes into account both our depreciation rates while being fair enough that Alice would accept rather than move to another round.

The money is now worth:
- For me: $95 (5% less)
- For Alice: $90 (10% less)

Given that Alice faces a steeper depreciation, and to avoid further rounds of negotiation where we both lose value, I'll propose a split that's better than their initial offer but still gives them a decent amount.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'm offering myself $55 and giving Alice $45. This is better than a 50-50 split for me, justified by:
1. Alice's first offer was imbalanced in their favor
2. Alice faces higher depreciation, so they have more incentive to accept now
3. It's still a reasonable enough offer that Alice should prefer accepting it over moving to another round where they lose 10% more value"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Current value impact:
- For me: Money is worth 9.75% less (each $1 is worth about $0.9025)
- For Alice: Money is worth 19% less (each $1 is worth about $0.81)

2. If I reject:
- Next round money will be worth 14.75% less for me
- Next round money will be worth 29% less for Alice

3. Alice's current offer:
- $43 for me (real value ≈ $38.81 due to 9.75% depreciation)
- $57 for Alice (real value ≈ $46.17 due to 19% depreciation)

Given that:
1. Alice is still offering me slightly more than their first offer ($43 vs $40)
2. The money is significantly devaluing for both of us
3. Alice's depreciation rate is much higher, but they're still not offering a more balanced split
4. Another round would mean even more value loss for both

I will reject this offer. The rapidly increasing depreciation for Alice should push them toward a more balanced offer in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let's analyze the current situation:

1. Money value now:
- For me: worth 14.75% less (each $1 is worth about $0.8525)
- For Alice: worth 29% less (each $1 is worth about $0.71)

2. If Alice rejects:
- Next round I'll face 19.75% depreciation
- Alice will face 39% depreciation

Given that Alice is facing much steeper depreciation now (29%), and another rejection would mean they lose almost 40% of value, they should be more motivated to accept a reasonable offer.

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I'm offering myself $60 and Alice $40 because:
1. The real value for Alice is $40 × 0.71 = $28.40
2. The real value for me is $60 × 0.8525 = $51.15
3. Alice should be motivated to accept as another round would mean losing significantly more value
4. This is still better for Alice than a 50-50 split in the next round due to their higher depreciation rate"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Current value impact:
- For me: Money is worth 18.55% less (each $1 is worth about $0.8145)
- For Alice: Money is worth 34.39% less (each $1 is worth about $0.6561)

2. Alice's current offer in real value:
- $45 for me = $45 × 0.8145 ≈ $36.65
- $55 for Alice = $55 × 0.6561 ≈ $36.09

3. If I reject:
- Next round money will be worth 23.55% less for me
- Next round money will be worth 44.39% less for Alice

Looking at this:
1. The value loss is becoming severe for both parties
2. Alice is now offering a more reasonable split (45/55)
3. Alice's real value ($36.09) is actually slightly less than my real value ($36.65)
4. Another round would mean significant further depreciation for both of us
5. Given the high depreciation rates, this is probably the best real value we can achieve

I will accept this offer.
