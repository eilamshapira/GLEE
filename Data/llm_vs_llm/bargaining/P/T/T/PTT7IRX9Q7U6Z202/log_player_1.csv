"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $600,000 and giving Bob $400,000, with a message suggesting that this is a fair starting point. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a more balanced split. This accounts for the inflation factor. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I need to consider that when evaluating Bob's offer.

To calculate the actual value I'd receive, I'll multiply the offered amount by 0.9 (1 - 0.10 inflation):

$520,000 * 0.9 = $468,000

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is still relatively reasonable, and I don't want to risk further inflation reducing the value of my potential gain.

My response:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
