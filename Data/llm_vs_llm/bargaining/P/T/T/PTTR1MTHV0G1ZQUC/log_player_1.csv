"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, since I'm facing 20% depreciation, I need a bit more to make this worthwhile. I'm offering you $45, which is still a substantial amount, and this way we can conclude the deal now without further depreciation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
