"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, Bob. I propose 60 for me and 40 for you. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: I get $40
2. If I reject, next round I can make an offer, but:
   * The money will be worth 20% less to me
   * $100 will only be worth $80 to me
   * Alice has no depreciation penalty

Alice's opening offer isn't terrible, but I can probably do better by making a counter-offer in the next round, even with the 20% depreciation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a strategic offer:

Since the money is worth 20% less to me now, I need to aim for a higher nominal amount to compensate. I'll propose a more aggressive split but with a reasonable justification.

{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Alice, since I'm facing 20% depreciation, I need a bit more to make this worthwhile. I'm offering you $45, which is still a substantial amount, and this way we can conclude the deal now without further depreciation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's split the money evenly.  While I'm not thrilled with the depreciation, I think a 50/50 split is the fairest option at this point. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Current offer: I get $50, but with 36% depreciation
   * Actual value to me: $50 * 0.64 = $32
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
   * Money will be worth 48.8% less to me
   * Even if I got $70, it would only be worth $35.84 to me
   * And Alice would be unlikely to accept such a high amount

Given the increasing depreciation and that Alice has moved to a more generous offer, I should accept this deal. The real value I'm getting ($32) is better than what I'm likely to achieve in future rounds due to the compounding depreciation effect.
