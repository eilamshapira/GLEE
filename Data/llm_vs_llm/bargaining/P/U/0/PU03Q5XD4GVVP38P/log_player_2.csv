"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. Alice is proposing to take 60% of the money, leaving me with 40% ($4000). Given that:
1. If I reject, the money will be worth 5% less next round (total value: $9500)
2. I'll get to make the next proposal if I reject
3. This is a reasonable offer, though not entirely fair
4. Prolonging negotiations means losing value

Even though I could counter-propose, the loss in value might not be worth it. $4000 now is better than potentially getting a slightly higher percentage of a smaller total.
