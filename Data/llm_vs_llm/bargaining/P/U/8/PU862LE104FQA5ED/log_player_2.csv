"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. There's no inflation penalty for me, so waiting doesn't hurt my position
4. 40/60 split is not terrible, but I could probably get a better deal

Given that I can make a counter-offer without any penalty, I'll try to negotiate for a better split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a more balanced offer, but slightly in my favor since I need to leave room for negotiation:

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I propose this split because:
1. It's closer to a fair 50/50 division
2. It gives me a slight advantage but is not too greedy
3. It's reasonable enough that Alice might accept it
4. If Alice rejects, we can continue negotiating, and I still won't face any inflation penalty"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:
1. Alice is now offering me $45, which is better than her initial offer of $40
2. Alice's gains are affected by 36% inflation, so her $55 is actually worth less to her (equivalent to about $35.2 in round 1 value)
3. My $45 still has full value since I'm not affected by inflation
4. Alice seems more willing to negotiate now, likely due to the inflation pressure on her side
5. However, if I reject, Alice's next potential gains will be worth even less to her, which might make her more desperate for a deal

Given that:
- My position is stronger due to the inflation only affecting Alice
- I'm getting a reasonable amount ($45)
- Further rounds might make Alice less rational due to increasing pressure
- This is a decent improvement from the initial offer
