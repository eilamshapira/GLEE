"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that Alice is proposing I get only 10% of the total amount ($1000) and she gets $9000, I think it's reasonable to reject this offer. Inflation will make my money worth less each round, but even with inflation, I can negotiate for a fairer distribution.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more equitable split that acknowledges the inflation pressure I'm facing.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split of the money. This gives us both equal amounts, which seems reasonable since we both need to agree on the division. Since I'm facing 20% inflation each round, it's important we reach a fair agreement quickly, and an even split is the most straightforward fair solution."
