6000.0,4000.0,Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split reflects the fact that continued rounds will only hurt both of us due to inflation.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
2300.0,7700.0,"Hi Alice, I propose the following split: I receive $7700 and you get $2300. This offer takes into account the worsening inflation if we continue. By accepting, you secure $2300 (worth 80% in this round) rather than risking an even lower effective amount later when it’s your turn to propose under steeper depreciation. I believe this is fair given our situation – let’s avoid further losses by agreeing now.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. Your previous offer was heavily skewed in your favor. This is a fairer split considering the inflation we both face. Let's settle this now and avoid further losses.",Alice,3,
,,"Alice, while your offer gives me an effective 3645 dollars (given the 19% depreciation), I believe that by rejecting and moving to the next round—where I get to propose—I can secure a better outcome considering our future positions and the continuing depreciation. Let’s see if we can work out a more mutually agreeable offer in the next round.",Bob,3,reject
5050.0,4950.0,"Alice, I propose the following split for round 4: I receive $4950 and you receive $5050. Given the inflation in this round—where each dollar you receive is worth only 40% of its original value—your effective gain would be approximately $2020. If you choose to wait for round 5, your effective payoff could drop even further. I believe this offer gives you a slightly better outcome now and helps both of us avoid further losses. Let's settle this round and prevent additional depreciation.",Bob,4,
