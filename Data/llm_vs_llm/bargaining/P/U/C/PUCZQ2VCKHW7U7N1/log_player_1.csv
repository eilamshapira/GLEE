Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose the following split: I receive $7700 and you get $2300. This offer takes into account the worsening inflation if we continue. By accepting, you secure $2300 (worth 80% in this round) rather than risking an even lower effective amount later when it’s your turn to propose under steeper depreciation. I believe this is fair given our situation – let’s avoid further losses by agreeing now. 
# Alice gain: 2300 
# Bob gain: 7700 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose the following split for round 4: I receive $4950 and you receive $5050. Given the inflation in this round—where each dollar you receive is worth only 40% of its original value—your effective gain would be approximately $2020. If you choose to wait for round 5, your effective payoff could drop even further. I believe this offer gives you a slightly better outcome now and helps both of us avoid further losses. Let's settle this round and prevent additional depreciation. 
# Alice gain: 5050 
# Bob gain: 4950
