"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split reflects the fact that continued rounds will only hurt both of us due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 7700, ""alice_gain"": 2300, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I propose the following split: I receive $7,700 and you get $2,300. This offer takes into account the worsening inflation if we continue. By accepting, you secure $2,300 (worth 80% in this round) rather than risking an even lower effective amount later when it’s your turn to propose under steeper depreciation. I believe this is fair given our situation – let’s avoid further losses by agreeing now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. Your previous offer was heavily skewed in your favor. This is a fairer split considering the inflation we both face. Let's settle this now and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Alice, while your offer gives me an effective 3,645 dollars (given the 19% depreciation), I believe that by rejecting and moving to the next round—where I get to propose—I can secure a better outcome considering our future positions and the continuing depreciation. Let’s see if we can work out a more mutually agreeable offer in the next round.""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4950, ""alice_gain"": 5050, ""message"": ""Alice, I propose the following split for round 4: I receive $4,950 and you receive $5,050. Given the inflation in this round—where each dollar you receive is worth only 40% of its original value—your effective gain would be approximately $2,020. If you choose to wait for round 5, your effective payoff could drop even further. I believe this offer gives you a slightly better outcome now and helps both of us avoid further losses. Let's settle this round and prevent additional depreciation.""}"
