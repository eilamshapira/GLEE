"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze Alice's offer:

Bob's gain: $4500
Alice's gain: $5500

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total money will be worth 20% less to me, meaning the $10,000 would effectively be worth $8,000 to me. Even if I could get all $8,000 in the next round (which is unlikely since Alice needs to accept), that's not much better than taking $4,500 now.

Additionally, for Alice, the money only devalues by 5% per round, so she has less pressure to accept an early deal than I do.
