"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me propose a fair split, considering the inflation risk for future rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split because it's close to equal but slightly in my favor. I want to give Bob a reasonable offer that he's likely to accept, avoiding future rounds where my money would be worth less due to inflation. This is fair enough to be acceptable while protecting my interests."
