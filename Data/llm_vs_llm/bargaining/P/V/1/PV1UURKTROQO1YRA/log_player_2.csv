"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 49 
# Alice gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer. She's proposing a nearly equal split, with her taking just $2 more than me. While I could reject and try to get more in the next round, I need to consider that:

1. The money will be worth 5% less next round
2. There's no guarantee I can get a significantly better deal
3. This is actually a quite fair offer
4. Starting with confrontation might lead to a less cooperative negotiation

Since $49 is very close to a 50-50 split and avoiding the 5% inflation penalty is valuable, I'll accept this offer.
