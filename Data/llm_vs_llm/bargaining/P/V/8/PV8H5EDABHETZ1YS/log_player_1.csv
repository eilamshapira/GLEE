"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make my first offer to Bob, considering the inflation rates.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

Since we need to agree on a fair division and time is not on our side (especially with my higher inflation rate), I'm offering a slightly higher portion for myself but still giving Bob a significant amount. This split acknowledges that we both need to reach an agreement quickly, as delays hurt both of us, particularly me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I notice we're both making similar offers but in opposite directions. Let's try to find a more mutually acceptable solution, considering the increasing inflation penalties.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing an even 50-50 split. This is a fair division that acknowledges both of our interests. With my higher inflation rate (10% per round vs your 5%), it's especially important that we reach an agreement soon, as delays impact me more severely. A fair split now is better than continued negotiations where we both lose value."
