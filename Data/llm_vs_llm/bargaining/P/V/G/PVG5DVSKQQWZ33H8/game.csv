4000.0,6000.0,I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. It reflects the risk I'm taking with inflation and gives us both a good starting point for negotiation.,Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, considering the inflation hitting us harder each round, I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. It's a fair compromise given the circumstances and ensures we both walk away with a reasonable amount before it devalues further.",Alice,3,

4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, I understand the inflation pressure, but my previous offer was more than fair. I'm willing to split the difference from my previous offer, a 55/45 split in my favor.  Let's close this deal and avoid further losses.",Bob,4,

6000.0,4000.0,"Bob, inflation is really taking a toll on our potential gains. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor this time. It's a bit more in my favor, but it's still a compromise considering how much the money is devaluing. Let's agree on this before it gets worse.",Alice,5,

5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, this back and forth isn't benefiting either of us. I'm proposing a final offer - a 50/50 split.  Let's end this now and walk away with something substantial before inflation erodes it further.",Bob,6,
