Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, consider the discount you face in every subsequent round – you lose 10% of any offer per round. In round 3, as proposer, you’d still be forced into a position where I can claim almost everything. Accept this offer now to secure what little there is for you, rather than risk ending up with nothing. 
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 1000000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, as we move further into the rounds your share loses 10% of its value each time. At round 4, your money is worth only about 73% of its full value. Waiting will only worsen your position. I'm offering you 150000 dollars now—an amount that, while not 50/50, avoids further devaluation and guarantees you some real value. Accept this offer and secure a better outcome than risking steep losses in future rounds.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, consider that if you reject this offer, the inflation in subsequent rounds will leave you with nothing. In round 7 you’d be the proposer, but with further discounting (only about 53% of face value) and Bob’s dominant position later, you’re destined to get 0. Even though 1 dollar may seem small, its effective value now (approximately 0.59 dollars) is strictly better than the nothing you’d get if the game continues. Accept this offer and salvage something from the pie before it erodes further.

# Bob gain: 999999

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, time is of the essence. In round 8, your nominal 900000 yields an effective value of about 900000 × 0.4783 ≈ 430467 – the best you can hope for. If you reject and become proposer in round 9, the further inflation will drop your multiplier to 0.4305, leaving you effectively no better off (and likely worse when I reassert my bargaining power). Accept this offer now to secure the highest effective value you can get.
