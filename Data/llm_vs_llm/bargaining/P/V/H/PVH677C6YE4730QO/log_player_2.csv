"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly down the middle. 500000$ for each of us.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 1000000, ""alice_gain"": 0, ""message"": ""Alice, consider the discount you face in every subsequent round – you lose 10% of any offer per round. In round 3, as proposer, you’d still be forced into a position where I can claim almost everything. Accept this offer now to secure what little there is for you, rather than risk ending up with nothing.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering the inflation affecting my share, I propose 450000$ for me and 550000$ for you. This is still a fair split given the circumstances, and it's better for both of us to end this soon.

At round 4, your money is worth only about 73% of its full value. Waiting will only worsen your position. I'm offering you 150,000 dollars now—an amount that, while not 50/50, avoids further devaluation and guarantees you some real value. Accept this offer and secure a better outcome than risking steep losses in future rounds.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, with each round, my share loses more value due to inflation. I'm offering 405000$ for me and 595000$ for you. This is a reasonable compromise given the situation. Let's end this now before it gets worse for both of us.

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 999999, ""alice_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Alice, consider that if you reject this offer, the inflation in subsequent rounds will leave you with nothing. In round 7 you’d be the proposer, but with further discounting (only about 53% of face value) and Bob’s dominant position later, you’re destined to get 0. Even though 1 dollar may seem small, its effective value now (approximately 0.59 dollars) is strictly better than the nothing you’d get if the game continues. Accept this offer and salvage something from the pie before it erodes further.""}"

Round 7

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 100000, ""alice_gain"": 900000, ""message"": ""Alice, time is of the essence. In round 8, your nominal 900,000 yields an effective value of about 900,000 × 0.4783 ≈ 430,467 – the best you can hope for. If you reject and become proposer in round 9, the further inflation will drop your multiplier to 0.4305, leaving you effectively no better off (and likely worse when I reassert my bargaining power). Accept this offer now to secure the highest effective value you can get.""}"
