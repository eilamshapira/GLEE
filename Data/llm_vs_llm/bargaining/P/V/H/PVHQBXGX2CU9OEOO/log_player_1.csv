"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's start fair, Bob. A 60/40 split seems reasonable.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  It's crucial to appear fair in the early rounds. Offering a slightly advantageous split to myself while still leaving Bob with a substantial amount shows I'm willing to negotiate but also value my share. The message aims for a collaborative tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's aim for a more equitable split, Alice. I propose 55/45 in my favor. With the clock ticking, this is a better deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is getting worse for me. While he talks about a more ""equitable"" split, the reality is that his gain increases while mine decreases. Accepting this sets a dangerous precedent for future rounds. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the cost of a continuously shrinking share. The inflation factor makes me more eager to secure a decent amount sooner rather than later."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, time is money, and we're both losing out. I'm coming up to meet you halfway. Let's seal the deal with a 55/45 split in my favor.""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 
* **Strategic mirroring:**  I'm mirroring Bob's previous offer but in my favor. This highlights the inherent fairness issue with his proposal while showing flexibility.
* **Urgency:** By emphasizing the time pressure and using phrases like ""seal the deal,"" I aim to instill a sense of urgency in Bob. 
* **Inflation:**  Another round has passed, and the value decreases further. It's getting riskier to hold out for a significantly better offer. 

This proposal aims for a balance between firmness and a willingness to compromise. It allows Bob to save face by accepting a split similar to his own, just with the roles reversed."
