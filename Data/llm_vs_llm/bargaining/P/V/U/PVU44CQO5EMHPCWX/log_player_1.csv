"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer to divide the $10,000 with Bob. Since we're starting the negotiation, I'll propose a fair split while leaving room for potential counter-offers.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I believe a 50-50 split is fair for both of us. This gives us each an equal share of the money, which respects the principle of equality in dividing the sum."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","After considering Bob's previous offer, I'll make a new proposal that addresses both our interests while acknowledging the inflation factor that affects him.

""bob_gain"": 5500}

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split for Bob compared to my initial 50-50 proposal, recognizing that inflation affects his gains. This is a fair compromise that gives both of us a substantial portion while accounting for the economic factors at play."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I notice that Bob is experiencing increasing inflation with each round, which is significantly affecting the value of his gains. Taking this into account, I'll make a more accommodating offer.

""bob_gain"": 6000}

This offer gives Bob a larger share to help offset the significant inflation he's experiencing (now at 48.8%). I'm willing to accept a smaller portion than my initial proposal to reach an agreement that works for both of us, considering the economic pressures Bob is facing."
