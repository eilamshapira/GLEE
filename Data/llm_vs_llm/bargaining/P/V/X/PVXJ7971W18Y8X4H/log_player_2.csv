"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which is perfectly fair. 

If I reject, I could propose a different split in the next round, but:
1. The total amount will be worth 5% less (only $95 total)
2. Alice could then reject my offer, leading to even more depreciation
3. A 50-50 split is generally considered the most fair and rational division

Given these factors, I'll accept this fair offer.
