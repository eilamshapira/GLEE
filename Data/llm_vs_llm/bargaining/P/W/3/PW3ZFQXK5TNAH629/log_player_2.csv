"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this... 

The offer gives me $40 out of $100. If I reject and move to the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me, so the total pot is effectively worth $80 from my perspective. Even if I managed to get a larger share in the next round, I'd need to get more than $50 just to break even with the current $40 offer.

Given the time pressure (12 rounds maximum) and the significant inflation penalty, getting $40 right now seems like a reasonable deal. While it's not an even split, it's a substantial amount and avoids the risk of ending up with nothing if negotiations fail.
