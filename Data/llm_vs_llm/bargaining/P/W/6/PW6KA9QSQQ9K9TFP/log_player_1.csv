"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split where I get $5,500 and you get $4,500. This is a reasonable offer considering we both want to reach an agreement quickly.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money. This way, we both get an equal share and can conclude the game quickly, minimizing the inflation effect. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's 50-50 split offer. While I proposed a slightly better deal for myself initially, a fair split is reasonable and accepting now ensures we both get a good outcome before inflation reduces the value further. This is a good compromise that benefits both parties."
