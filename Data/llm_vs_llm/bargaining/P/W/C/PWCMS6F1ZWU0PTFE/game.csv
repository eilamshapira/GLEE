468559.0,531441.0,"Hi Bob, I propose that I get $468559 and you get $531441. If you reject, you’ll be able to propose in round 2—but given that your money is discounted by 10% each round (0.9 multiplier), your best continuation in round 2 would yield a value equivalent to $531441 now. Accepting today avoids further discounting, so I believe this split is fair based on our future prospects.",Alice,1,

415000.0,585000.0,"Alice, I understand your previous offer, but considering the inflation affect on me, I need to secure a bit more. If you accept, you'll still walk away with a substantial amount. If you reject, remember that my offers will have to account for the decreasing value of the money for me.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, while I appreciate your attempt to account for inflation, your offer only gives me $415000. If I reject, I will have the move in round 3, where I can structure the division in my favor knowing that your future shares will suffer even further from inflation (0.9 multiplier squared and so on). Given my improved bargaining position as proposer in the next round, I expect to secure a higher effective share than $415000. So I must reject your current proposal.",Alice,2,reject
481481.0,518519.0,"Hi Bob, here’s my Round 3 proposal: I propose that I receive $481481 and you receive $518519 nominally. However, please note that due to inflation your money now is worth 0.81 of its nominal value—about $418519 in today’s terms. I believe this offer gives you roughly what you’d expect if you waited until Round 4 to propose (bearing in mind further discounting), so accepting now is in your best interest. I look forward to a fair agreement.",Alice,3,

370000.0,630000.0,"Alice, given the continuing impact of inflation on my side, I need to secure a higher amount. This offer still provides you with a significant portion. If you reject, I'll have to consider the further decreasing value of the money for me in future rounds.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, I appreciate your concern regarding the inflation on your side. However, this offer gives me only $370000, while you’d nominally receive $630000—which, after a 27.1% discount, amounts to an effective $459270. If I reject this offer, I will get to propose in Round 5, at which point your discount will be even harsher (approximately a 34.4% reduction, i.e. a multiplier of 0.6561). This shift in bargaining power means I can structure a proposal that better reflects my improved position. In light of this, I must reject your current offer.",Alice,4,reject
432000.0,568000.0,"Hi Bob, here’s my Round 5 proposal: I propose that I receive $432000 and you receive $568000. Keep in mind that in Round 5 your money’s nominal value is discounted by a factor of 0.6561, so your effective value would be about 568000 × 0.6561 ≈ $372665. If you reject, you’d become the proposer in Round 6, but then your money would be discounted even further (by a factor of 0.59049), likely leaving you with an effective amount around $372000 or less. This proposal gives you just a bit more than your continuation value. I believe it’s a fair split under the current conditions. Looking forward to your acceptance.",Alice,5,
