"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 468559, ""bob_gain"": 531441, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that I get $468,559 and you get $531,441. If you reject, you’ll be able to propose in round 2—but given that your money is discounted by 10% each round (0.9 multiplier), your best continuation in round 2 would yield a value equivalent to $531,441 now. Accepting today avoids further discounting, so I believe this split is fair based on our future prospects.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your previous offer, but considering the inflation affect on me, I need to secure a bit more. If you accept, you'll still walk away with a substantial amount. If you reject, remember that my offers will have to account for the decreasing value of the money for me. 
# Alice gain: 415000 
# Bob gain: 585000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your attempt to account for inflation, your offer only gives me $415,000. If I reject, I will have the move in round 3, where I can structure the division in my favor knowing that your future shares will suffer even further from inflation (0.9 multiplier squared and so on). Given my improved bargaining position as proposer in the next round, I expect to secure a higher effective share than $415,000. So I must reject your current proposal.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 481481, ""bob_gain"": 518519, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here’s my Round 3 proposal: I propose that I receive $481,481 and you receive $518,519 nominally. However, please note that due to inflation your money now is worth 0.81 of its nominal value—about $418,519 in today’s terms. I believe this offer gives you roughly what you’d expect if you waited until Round 4 to propose (bearing in mind further discounting), so accepting now is in your best interest. I look forward to a fair agreement.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, given the continuing impact of inflation on my side, I need to secure a higher amount. This offer still provides you with a significant portion. If you reject, I'll have to consider the further decreasing value of the money for me in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 370000 
# Bob gain: 630000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your concern regarding the inflation on your side. However, this offer gives me only $370,000, while you’d nominally receive $630,000—which, after a 27.1% discount, amounts to an effective $459,270. If I reject this offer, I will get to propose in Round 5, at which point your discount will be even harsher (approximately a 34.4% reduction, i.e. a multiplier of 0.6561). This shift in bargaining power means I can structure a proposal that better reflects my improved position. In light of this, I must reject your current offer.""}"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 432000, ""bob_gain"": 568000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here’s my Round 5 proposal: I propose that I receive $432,000 and you receive $568,000. Keep in mind that in Round 5 your money’s nominal value is discounted by a factor of 0.6561, so your effective value would be about 568,000 × 0.6561 ≈ $372,665. If you reject, you’d become the proposer in Round 6, but then your money would be discounted even further (by a factor of 0.59049), likely leaving you with an effective amount around $372,000 or less. This proposal gives you just a bit more than your continuation value. I believe it’s a fair split under the current conditions. Looking forward to your acceptance.""}"
