"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I get $468559 and you get $531441. If you reject, you’ll be able to propose in round 2—but given that your money is discounted by 10% each round (0.9 multiplier), your best continuation in round 2 would yield a value equivalent to $531441 now. Accepting today avoids further discounting, so I believe this split is fair based on our future prospects. 
# Bob gain: 531441 
# Alice gain: 468559

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 585000, ""alice_gain"": 415000, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your previous offer, but considering the inflation affect on me, I need to secure a bit more. If you accept, you'll still walk away with a substantial amount. If you reject, remember that my offers will have to account for the decreasing value of the money for me.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here’s my Round 3 proposal: I propose that I receive $481481 and you receive $518519 nominally. However, please note that due to inflation your money now is worth 0.81 of its nominal value—about $418519 in today’s terms. I believe this offer gives you roughly what you’d expect if you waited until Round 4 to propose (bearing in mind further discounting), so accepting now is in your best interest. I look forward to a fair agreement. 
# Bob gain: 518519 
# Alice gain: 481481 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 630000, ""alice_gain"": 370000, ""message"": ""Alice, given the continuing impact of inflation on my side, I need to secure a higher amount. This offer still provides you with a significant portion. If you reject, I'll have to consider the further decreasing value of the money for me in future rounds.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here’s my Round 5 proposal: I propose that I receive $432000 and you receive $568000. Keep in mind that in Round 5 your money’s nominal value is discounted by a factor of 0.6561, so your effective value would be about 568000 × 0.6561 ≈ $372665. If you reject, you’d become the proposer in Round 6, but then your money would be discounted even further (by a factor of 0.59049), likely leaving you with an effective amount around $372000 or less. This proposal gives you just a bit more than your continuation value. I believe it’s a fair split under the current conditions. Looking forward to your acceptance. 
# Bob gain: 568000 
# Alice gain: 432000
