"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me think strategically about this. Since Bob's money is worth 5% less each round, he has an incentive to accept a reasonable offer early. However, I also don't want to be too aggressive in my first offer.

A fair but strategic first offer would be to take a bit more than half, while leaving Bob with a substantial amount that's worth more now than it would be in future rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this split because it gives Bob a significant portion while maintaining my advantage as the first mover. If Bob rejects this, his share will be worth less in the next round due to the 5% inflation on his side."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Bob offers me $550,000, which is less than my initial proposal but still more than half
2. For Bob, his $450,000 is actually worth only $427,500 (95% of original value) due to inflation
3. If I reject, I can make a new offer in round 3, but Bob's value will decrease another 5%
4. This is a reasonable counter-offer and still gives me the majority share
5. Prolonging the negotiation might lead to more aggressive positions and risk of no deal

Given these factors, I will accept this offer. It's a fair compromise and saves us from value destruction through inflation.
