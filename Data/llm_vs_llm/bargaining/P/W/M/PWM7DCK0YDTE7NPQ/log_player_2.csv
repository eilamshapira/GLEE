"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer gives me $400,000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 20% inflation, any amount in the next round will be worth 20% less to me
4. For Alice, the next round only has 5% inflation

If I reject and propose in next round:
- The $1M will be worth $800,000 to me and $950,000 to Alice
- Alice would likely reject any offer that gives her less than her current $600,000 value

Given the high inflation penalty for me (20%) vs Alice's lower penalty (5%), accepting $400,000 now is better than risking a negotiation where my bargaining power decreases significantly.
