"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 2, keeping in mind the inflation:

Since it's Round 2, the money is worth 10% less for me. Effectively, my share is worth 90% of its face value. Alice's money is worth 20% less, so her share is worth 80% of its face value.

I'll propose a division that reflects this, but still aims to get me a decent share.

Here's my proposal in JSON format:

```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""alice_gain"": 600000
}
```"
