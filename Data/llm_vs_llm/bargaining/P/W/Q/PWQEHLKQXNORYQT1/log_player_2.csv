"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering you face 5% depreciation each round while I don't. Taking this deal now maximizes your value. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

If I reject, in the next round I can make a counter-offer, but the total value will be worth 5% less to me. So $40 now is worth more than $42 in the next round (which would only be worth about $39.90 to me due to the 5% depreciation).

Alice is correct that I face depreciation while she doesn't, which gives her some negotiating leverage. Her 60-40 split acknowledges this dynamic while still giving me a substantial portion.

If I reject and we go back and forth too long, we risk getting nothing if we can't agree within 12 rounds. Getting $40 now is better than risking getting less later or nothing at all.

This seems like a reasonable first offer given the circumstances.
