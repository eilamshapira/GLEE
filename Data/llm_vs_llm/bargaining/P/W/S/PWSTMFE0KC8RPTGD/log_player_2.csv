"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money evenly and conclude this quickly. With inflation affecting me at 5% per round, delaying only reduces our total value. This is a fair 50-50 split that maximizes our collective outcome. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which gives me $5,000. With 10% inflation affecting me each round, if I reject and we continue negotiating, the money will be worth less to me in future rounds.

If I reject now and make a counter-offer in round 2, the total would only be worth $9,000 to me. Even if I managed to get more than $5,000 in a later round, the inflation might offset those gains.

Given that we have a fair 50-50 split offer now, and the risk of losing value with each passing round, I'll accept this offer.
