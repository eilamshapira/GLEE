"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to consider the inflation and the limited number of rounds. Since this is the first round, I'll start with a somewhat generous offer to increase the chances of Bob accepting.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob rejected my initial offer. Now it's his turn, and he's offering me $400,000.

Let's analyze:

*   **My perspective:** $400,000 now is worth 20% less than it would have been in round 1. So, it's effectively worth $400,000 * 0.8 = $320,000 in round 1 dollars.
*   **Bob's perspective:** Bob gets $600,000 which is still worth $600,000 in round 1 dollars to him.
*   **Alternatives:** If I reject, I'll have to make another offer in round 3, and the money will be worth even less to me. Plus, there's no guarantee Bob will be more generous next time.

Given the inflation and the limited rounds, getting $320,000 (in round 1 dollars) is better than risking getting nothing. Even though Bob is getting a larger share, rejecting might lead to a worse outcome for me.
