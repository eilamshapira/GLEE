"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice has offered me 40% ($4000) while keeping 60% ($6000) for herself. Given that we have 12 rounds and each round reduces the value by 10% for me due to inflation, I should consider this carefully.

If I reject now, the next round my $4000 would only be worth $3600 to me due to the 10% inflation. I need to decide if holding out for a potentially better deal is worth the guaranteed loss from inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while acknowledging the inflation pressure I'm facing.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. This is equitable for both of us, and keeps in mind that delays affect me through inflation. A fair split now benefits us both more than extended negotiation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer, slightly better for you 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer considering the inflation effect. Alice has increased my share from $4000 to $4200, while reducing her share from $6000 to $5800.

Due to 19% inflation so far, the $4200 is effectively worth $3402 to me (4200 Ã— 0.81). If I reject and we continue to the next round, inflation will increase to 29%, further reducing the value of any money I receive.

While this isn't a 50-50 split, Alice has moved in my direction, and the inflation penalty means waiting longer will cost me more. Getting $3402 in effective value now is better than risking further rounds of negotiation with increasing inflation.
