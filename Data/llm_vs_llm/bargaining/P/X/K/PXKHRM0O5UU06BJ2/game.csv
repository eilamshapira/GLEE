450000.0,550000.0,"Given that the money loses value for you each round but not for me, this is a fair split that gives you $450000 now rather than less value later. Let's make a deal.",Bob,2,

400000.0,600000.0,Think carefully: your $400000 now is worth more than a larger number later due to your 10% loss per round. Each rejection costs you real value while my share maintains its worth. This is your best opportunity for maximum value.,Bob,4,

560000.0,440000.0,"Still willing to compromise, but I won't go below this",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"Consider this carefully: Due to your 34% loss in value, your last offer of $560K is only worth $367K to you. This offer of $350K NOW is actually worth more to you than waiting and getting a larger number later. Each round costs you another 10% in value. Time is heavily in my favor - let's make a deal that still gives you significant value.",Bob,6,
