Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Consider this carefully: Due to your 34% loss in value, your last offer of $560K is only worth $367K to you. This offer of $350K NOW is actually worth more to you than waiting and getting a larger number later. Each round costs you another 10% in value. Time is heavily in my favor - let's make a deal that still gives you significant value.
