"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split, let's end this! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $400,000, keeping $600,000 for herself
2. The money loses 10% value for Alice each round, but keeps its value for me
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
4. From Alice's perspective, waiting one round means her share would be worth 10% less
5. This gives me negotiating leverage in future rounds
6. A 60-40 split in Alice's favor isn't optimal given my stronger position

Given these factors, I should reject this offer and propose a more favorable split in the next round, taking advantage of the time pressure on Alice.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a strategic offer considering that:
1. Alice faces 10% depreciation per round while I don't
2. She just proposed 60-40 in her favor, showing her initial position
3. I should propose a split that's better for me but not so aggressive that she'll certainly reject
4. I should remind her of the time pressure she faces

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Given that the money loses value for you each round but not for me, this is a fair split that gives you $450,000 now rather than less value later. Let's make a deal.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer, slightly better for you, but I still deserve the bigger share 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice has only marginally improved her offer (from $400K to $420K for me)
2. Her $580K would actually be worth about $470K to her due to 19% inflation
3. She's still asking for a significantly larger share despite being in a weaker position
4. We still have 9 rounds left, and each round weakens her position further
5. By next round, her money will be worth 29% less
6. I maintain full value of my share regardless of time
7. This gives me strong leverage to negotiate for a better deal

Given these factors, this offer is still not good enough considering my advantageous position.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a stronger offer now, considering:
1. Alice has already lost 19% value and will lose 29% next round
2. She's still trying to maintain a majority share despite her weakening position
3. I need to make it clear that time is working against her
4. I should aim for a better split while still leaving her enough incentive to accept

{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Think carefully: your $400,000 now is worth more than a larger number later due to your 10% loss per round. Each rejection costs you real value while my share maintains its worth. This is your best opportunity for maximum value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Still willing to compromise, but I won't go below this 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice's offered me $440K (up from $420K last time)
2. Her $560K would only be worth about $367K to her due to 34.39% inflation
3. She's still not fully acknowledging her rapidly weakening position
4. We still have 7 rounds left
5. Next round, her money will be worth 41% less
6. My money maintains full value regardless of time
7. She's only making small incremental increases in her offers despite significant value loss

Given that I'm in an increasingly stronger position and her share is rapidly losing value, this offer is still not good enough. I should continue negotiating for a better split.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a stronger offer now, considering:
1. Alice has already lost 34.39% value and will lose even more next round
2. Her $560K would only be worth $367K to her now, showing her position is rapidly weakening
3. She needs to understand that further delays significantly hurt her position
4. I should make an offer that clearly demonstrates the reality of the situation

{""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Consider this carefully: Due to your 34% loss in value, your last offer of $560K is only worth $367K to you. This offer of $350K NOW is actually worth more to you than waiting and getting a larger number later. Each round costs you another 10% in value. Time is heavily in my favor - let's make a deal that still gives you significant value.""}"
