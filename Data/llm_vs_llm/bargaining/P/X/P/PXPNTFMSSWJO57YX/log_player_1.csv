"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair offer that acknowledges the inflation risk for both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split which is fair to both of us. Since we face 5% inflation each round, it's in our mutual interest to reach an agreement early. This even split maximizes our collective outcome while treating us both equally."
