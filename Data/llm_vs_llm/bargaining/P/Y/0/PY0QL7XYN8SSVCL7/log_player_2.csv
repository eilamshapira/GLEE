"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. Alice has proposed a 50-50 split, which is seemingly fair. However, if I reject this offer, I can make my own proposal next round. The downside is that due to inflation, the money will be worth 20% less for me in the next round.

If I reject:
- Next round the total value to me would be $8,000 (20% less)
- I could propose a more favorable split
- But Alice might reject, leading to further rounds and more value loss

If I accept now:
- I get $5,000 at full value
- No risk of further inflation
- Guaranteed outcome

Given that inflation will significantly impact my potential gains in future rounds, and this is a fair offer, I'll accept.
