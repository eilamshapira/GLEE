This is a classic game theory approach. I'm offering a large majority of the money to myself (90% of the total) while giving a small amount (10%) to Bob. This is done with the expectation that Bob will accept the offer in the first round. The hope is to secure the majority of the money before the inflation kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I am lowering my initial offer to 80% for myself, while giving Bob 20% of the money. This is still a very good deal for me, as the money is worth less than before due to inflation. I'm also trying to understand Bob's strategy and see if he is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I am rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to a 50/50 split, it's still not favorable to me, especially considering the significant inflation. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal for myself in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but this time it's a smaller reduction. I'm hoping to signal that I'm willing to compromise, but still want to secure a majority of the money. I'm also factoring in the increasing inflation, and  it's important to secure a reasonable amount before the value drops too much further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a much more reasonable offer considering the inflation.  While it's a 50/50 split, the potential for getting nothing at all is significant at this point. Accepting the offer ensures that I still receive a substantial amount of money."
