"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, 50-50. What do you say, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which gives me $50 and her $50. While this seems fair on the surface, I need to remember that inflation will reduce the value by 20% each round if I reject.

If I reject and we go to the next round, the total money will still be $100, but it will be worth 20% less to me. So even if I proposed a split more favorable to me in the next round, I'd need to get at least $62.50 to match what I can get now ($50 รท 0.8 = $62.50).

Given the inflation risk and that 50-50 is objectively fair, I'll accept this offer.
