"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. Since I'm facing 10% inflation per round, waiting is costly for me, so I'm offering you a substantial portion upfront to reach an agreement quickly.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm also facing inflation, and I think a 55/45 split is fairer. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Bob, I understand we both want a fair deal. Because of inflation, each round costs me significantly. Let's meet in the middle with a 55/45 split in my favor. This is very reasonable considering my inflation penalty, and I hope we can agree now rather than losing more value.""}"
