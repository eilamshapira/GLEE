"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. It's a perfectly equal split (50/50)
2. We're in round 1, so there's no inflation yet
3. If I reject, the next offer will be worth 20% less overall
4. Even if I propose a better split for myself next round, Alice might reject it
5. This is a fair offer that gives me $5000
