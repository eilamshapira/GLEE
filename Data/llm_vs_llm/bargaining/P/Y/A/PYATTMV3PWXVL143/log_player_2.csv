"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","While the offer is fair in terms of an even split, I can negotiate for a better deal since inflation doesn't affect me but significantly impacts Alice's value over time.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing this division because I know time affects your money's value but not mine. This gives you more now rather than waiting for further rounds when inflation will reduce your share's value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has now offered me the same terms I proposed in the previous round. Since we're already at round 3, and Alice is experiencing inflation on her end, this is a reasonable offer for both of us.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
