"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I think a 60-40 split is fair given that inflation affects me more than you. With every round, my share loses 10% of its value, so I need a slightly larger portion to make up for this disadvantage.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your point about the inflation affecting you more. How about a 55-45 split? It's closer to the middle while still acknowledging the inflation disadvantage. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
