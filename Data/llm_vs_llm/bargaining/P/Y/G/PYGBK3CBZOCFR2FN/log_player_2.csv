"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I think a 60-40 split is fair given that inflation affects me more than you. With every round, my share loses 10% of its value, so I need a slightly larger portion to make up for this disadvantage. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
