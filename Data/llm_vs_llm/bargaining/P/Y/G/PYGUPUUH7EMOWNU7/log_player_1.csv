"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation affecting your share more, I propose 60/40 in my favor to balance out the impact over rounds. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the fact that the money I gain is worth 20% less, I will reject this offer as it doesn't take into account the decreased value of my share.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less in each round, and this is the third round, the value of the money I receive will be 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 of its original value.

To account for this, I'll make a new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 30, 
""bob_gain"": 70, 
""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to take a smaller share to ensure we can agree before further devaluation.""}"
