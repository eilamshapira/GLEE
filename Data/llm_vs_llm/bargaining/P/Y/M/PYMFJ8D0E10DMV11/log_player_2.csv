"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. With no inflation for me, my $4,000 stays at full value regardless of when we settle. However, Alice faces 20% inflation per round, so her money loses value if we continue.

If I reject and propose in the next round, Alice would only value her money at 80% of the current value. This gives me some leverage for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that leverages the inflation Alice faces while still being fair enough that she should accept it.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

Since Alice faces 20% inflation each round, if she rejects this offer, her potential $4500 would only be worth about $3600 to her in the next round. This gives her an incentive to accept now rather than continuing, while I get a better split than her initial offer."
