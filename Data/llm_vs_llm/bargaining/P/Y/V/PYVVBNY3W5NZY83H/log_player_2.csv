"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's keep it fair and simple by splitting the $100 equally at $50 each. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer. She's proposing a 50-50 split, which would give me $50 and her $50. This seems fair at first glance.

However, I need to consider the inflation effect. If I reject and we move to the next round, the money will be worth 10% less to me. That means in round 2, the $100 would only be worth $90 to me. If I proposed a perfect split then, I'd only get $45 worth of value.

Since this is round 1 and Alice is offering me exactly half, which is fair, I should accept this offer now rather than risk getting less value in future rounds due to inflation.
