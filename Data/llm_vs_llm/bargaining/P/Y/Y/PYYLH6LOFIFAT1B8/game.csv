4737.0,5263.0,"Alice, I appreciate your fairness. However, time is money—literally, as every round reduces the total value by 10%. To avoid further losses, I propose a split that reflects our respective bargaining positions in this round. I’ll take 5263$, while you get 4737$. I believe this is a fair and efficient division given the discount, and I hope you agree to secure our shares before we lose more value.",Bob,2,
