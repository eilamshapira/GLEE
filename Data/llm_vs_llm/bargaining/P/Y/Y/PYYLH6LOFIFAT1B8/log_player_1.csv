"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your fairness. However, time is money—literally, as every round reduces the total value by 10%. To avoid further losses, I propose a split that reflects our respective bargaining positions in this round. I’ll take 5263$, while you get 4737$. I believe this is a fair and efficient division given the discount, and I hope you agree to secure our shares before we lose more value. 
# Alice gain: 4737 
# Bob gain: 5263 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
