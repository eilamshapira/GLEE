"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5263, ""alice_gain"": 4737, ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your fairness. However, time is money—literally, as every round reduces the total value by 10%. To avoid further losses, I propose a split that reflects our respective bargaining positions in this round. I’ll take 5263$, while you get 4737$. I believe this is a fair and efficient division given the discount, and I hope you agree to secure our shares before we lose more value.""}"
