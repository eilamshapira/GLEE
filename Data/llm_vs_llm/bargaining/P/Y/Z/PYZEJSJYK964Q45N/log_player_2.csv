"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering a split that gives me a comfortable majority. Let's end this quickly! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

- Alice is offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000
- If I reject and we go to the next round, inflation will reduce the value by 10% for me
- Next round, the total would effectively be worth $900,000 to me, and I could make a counter-offer
- However, I'd need to offer Alice enough to make her accept

While $400,000 isn't an even split, it's a substantial amount. If I reject, I risk either ending up with less after inflation or entering a lengthy negotiation where both of us lose value.

Given the 10% inflation penalty per round, accepting $400,000 now is likely better than trying to negotiate for more in future rounds.
