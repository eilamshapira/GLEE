"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split, considering I need to make it attractive enough for Bob to accept since inflation will hurt my gains if we continue.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose $5,500 for me and $4,500 for Bob. I believe this is a reasonable offer that gives me a slight advantage while still being fair enough for Bob to consider accepting rather than moving to the next round."
