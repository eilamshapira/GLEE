"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
- Alice is offering me $4,500 out of $10,000 (45%)
- This is slightly less than an equal split
- The money doesn't lose value for me over rounds due to 0% inflation
- I could counter-offer in the next round and try to get more
- However, Alice might respond with an even less favorable offer

Given that $4,500 is a reasonably good amount and not too far from an equal split, and considering there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in subsequent rounds, I'll accept this offer.
