"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split the $100 with me taking $60 and you taking $40. I believe this is a fair distribution considering potential inflation costs. Let's make a deal!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the inflation, I think a split of $55 for me and $45 for you is more fair this round. Let's agree on this before the money loses more value. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
