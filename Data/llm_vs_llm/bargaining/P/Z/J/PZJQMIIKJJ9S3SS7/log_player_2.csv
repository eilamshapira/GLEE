"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split it 60/40. This is a fair offer considering potential inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze this offer. I, as Bob, would get $40. If I reject, I'll be making an offer next round, but the value of the money will be 20% less for me. This means $100 will effectively be worth $80 to me in the next round.

If I think Alice will offer me a similar split next round, I might get 40% of $80, which is $32. This is less than the $40 I'm being offered now. Therefore, it is better to accept now.
