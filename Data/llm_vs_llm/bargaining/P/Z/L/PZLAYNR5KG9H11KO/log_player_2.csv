"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the $1000000 evenlyâ€”$500000 each. This fair offer ensures we both secure a large sum immediately, avoiding any loss in value due to inflation in later rounds. I look forward to your acceptance so that we can both benefit without delay. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice offers a 50-50 split ($500,000 each)
2. This is the first round, so there's no inflation impact yet
3. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make an offer
   * But the money will be worth 5% less to me
   * $500,000 now is better than trying to get more later with inflation
4. A 50-50 split is traditionally considered fair
5. Trying to negotiate for more might lead to a worse outcome due to inflation

Given that this is a fair offer with no inflation impact, and any future rounds would reduce my real gains due to inflation, I should accept this offer.
