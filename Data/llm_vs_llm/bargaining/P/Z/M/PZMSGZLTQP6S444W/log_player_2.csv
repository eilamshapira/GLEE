"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split of the $1,000,000, which would give me $500,000. Since this is the first round, I haven't lost any value to inflation yet.

However, if I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, I'll face 20% inflation, meaning the money will be worth less to me. If I propose a better split for myself in round 2, Alice might reject it, and we'd continue losing value with each round.

Given the inflation penalty and the risk of getting nothing if we reach round 12 without agreement, a fair 50-50 split in the very first round seems reasonable.
