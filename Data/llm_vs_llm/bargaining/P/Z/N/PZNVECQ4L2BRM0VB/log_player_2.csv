"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With Alice's offer, I (Bob) would get $4,000 and she would get $6,000.

If I reject and move to the next round:
- The total value will decrease by 10% for me (I'll only value it at $9,000)
- It will decrease by 5% for Alice (she'll value it at $9,500)
- I'll get to make the next proposal

While I could try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round, the inflation penalty is significant, especially for me. Even if I proposed a more favorable split next round, the total pie would be smaller.

The current offer gives me 40% of the pot, which isn't terrible considering the risk of value loss.
