4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, I believe a more equitable split would be 55-45 in my favor. Given that inflation affects you more severely (20% vs my 10% per round), it's in both our interests to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. This offer is fair considering the differential inflation impact.",Bob,2,
