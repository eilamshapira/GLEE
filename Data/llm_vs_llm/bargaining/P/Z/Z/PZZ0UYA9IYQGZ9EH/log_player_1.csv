"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I believe a more equitable split would be 55-45 in my favor. Given that inflation affects you more severely (20% vs my 10% per round), it's in both our interests to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. This offer is fair considering the differential inflation impact. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
