"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a 70-30 split. It's a fair offer to begin with. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is suggesting I get 30% ($3000) while she gets 70% ($7000). This division seems quite imbalanced in her favor. 

Given that inflation affects me less than it does Alice (10% vs 20% per round), I have a strategic advantage in later rounds. If I reject now, I can make a counter-offer in the next round where the money will be worth 90% of its current value to me, but only 80% to Alice.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced division that acknowledges the inflation differences between us.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Alice, I believe a more equitable split would be 55-45 in my favor. Given that inflation affects you more severely (20% vs my 10% per round), it's in both our interests to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. This offer is fair considering the differential inflation impact.""}"
