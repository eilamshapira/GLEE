"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Split it evenly, fair for both""
}
```

I'm proposing an even split, hoping Bob will see it as a reasonable offer and accept it to avoid the risk of losing value due to inflation in subsequent rounds."
