5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 50/50 split of $10000. Settling early means we both secure our shares without any further reduction in valueâ€”especially on my side with the inflation risk. I believe this fair division is a great starting point for both of us. Looking forward to your thoughts!",Alice,1,

4750.0,5250.0,"Hi Alice, thanks for your initial proposal. While a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, I'm a bit more vulnerable to the inflation over time.  I propose a slight adjustment to 5250/4750, which helps me offset the risk.  It still provides a significant sum for both of us. Let me know what you think!",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, thank you for your proposal. Given the inflation penalty that applies to my funds with each round, I agree that locking in an offer now is better than risking further reduction in value. I accept your offer of 4750 for me and 5250 for you.",Alice,2,accept
