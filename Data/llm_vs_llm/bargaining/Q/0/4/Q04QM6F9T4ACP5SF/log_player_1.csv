"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 50/50 split of $10,000. Settling early means we both secure our shares without any further reduction in valueâ€”especially on my side with the inflation risk. I believe this fair division is a great starting point for both of us. Looking forward to your thoughts!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your initial proposal. While a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, I'm a bit more vulnerable to the inflation over time.  I propose a slight adjustment to 5250/4750, which helps me offset the risk.  It still provides a significant sum for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your proposal. Given the inflation penalty that applies to my funds with each round, I agree that locking in an offer now is better than risking further reduction in value. I accept your offer of 4750 for me and 5250 for you.""}"
