"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 50/50 split of $10000. Settling early means we both secure our shares without any further reduction in valueâ€”especially on my side with the inflation risk. I believe this fair division is a great starting point for both of us. Looking forward to your thoughts! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000

 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your initial proposal. While a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, I'm a bit more vulnerable to the inflation over time.  I propose a slight adjustment to 5250/4750, which helps me offset the risk.  It still provides a significant sum for both of us. Let me know what you think!""
