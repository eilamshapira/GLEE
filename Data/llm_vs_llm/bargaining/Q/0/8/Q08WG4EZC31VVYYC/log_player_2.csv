"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair is fair! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer is a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
2. However, if I reject, I can make my own offer next round
3. Due to inflation:
   - For me, money will be worth 5% less next round
   - For Alice, money will be worth 10% less next round
4. This means Alice has more pressure to accept my next offer
5. I could potentially get a better deal next round by offering something like 6000/4000

But there's also risk in rejecting:
- If Alice then rejects my offer, we both lose more value
- A fair split now might be better than an uncertain outcome later

Given that this is a solid, fair offer and there's risk in continuing, I'll accept.
