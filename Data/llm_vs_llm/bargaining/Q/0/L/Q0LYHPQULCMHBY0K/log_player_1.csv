"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's split this fairly. I'm proposing 60/40. What do you say?""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my offer is 55/45. We both benefit more than in your previous proposal, and it's fairer given inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Okay, I need to take into account the inflation. My money is worth 5% less than in Round 1, and Bob's money is worth 20% less. That makes accepting a lower offer relatively more attractive to me now.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Alright Bob, considering the inflation, I'm now proposing 55/45. Let's close the deal here.""
}
```"
