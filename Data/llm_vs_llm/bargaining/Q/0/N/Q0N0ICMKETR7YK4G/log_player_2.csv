"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. The offer is quite low - only 10% of the total sum
2. With inflation, each round reduces my potential gain by 20%
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
4. Even with 20% inflation, I could still get more by making a better offer next round

I'll reject this low offer. Even with inflation, I can propose a more favorable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me make a reasonable offer:
- Total amount is $1,000,000
- I need to account for inflation (my money is worth 20% less now)
- I should propose a fair split to increase chances of acceptance
- If Alice rejects, we'll both lose more value in next rounds

I'll propose a more balanced split, slightly in my favor to compensate for inflation:

{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000}

This gives me 60% and Alice 40%, which is much more balanced than her initial offer. It's fair enough that Alice might accept, but also accounts for my inflation disadvantage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 190000 
# Alice gain: 810000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Alice offered me $190,000, but with 36% inflation, it's actually worth about $121,600 to me
2. If I reject and we continue:
   - Next round my inflation will be worse (down ~49%)
   - I can make another offer, but the value keeps decreasing
3. Alice's inflation is lower (19%), suggesting she has less pressure to conclude quickly
4. While this offer is better than her first one ($100,000), it's still quite low
5. However, with increasing inflation difference, my negotiating position gets worse each round

Given the accelerating inflation difference, and that Alice seems to have a better inflation rate, I should probably accept this offer. Making this a longer negotiation will hurt me more than her.
