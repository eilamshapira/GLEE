"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice is offering me $3,000 out of $10,000
2. If I reject, we go to next round where:
   * I can make an offer
   * But my money will be worth 20% less
   * $3,000 now vs. potential higher amount but worth 20% less

Since this is a fairly low offer (only 30% of the total), and I'll have negotiating power next round, I'll reject despite the inflation penalty.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me make a strategic offer:
Since Alice knows:
1. She didn't lose any value due to inflation
2. She can reject and make another offer next round
3. My money will be worth another 20% less next round

I should make a reasonable offer that's attractive enough for her to accept, but better for me than her first offer.

{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500}

I propose this split because:
1. It's more balanced than her 30-70 split
2. She still gets the majority (55%)
3. It's good enough that she should accept rather than risk me rejecting her next offer"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice is offering $3,500, but with 36% inflation, it's actually worth $2,240 to me
2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make an offer
   * But my money will be worth 48.8% less (another 20% drop)
   * Any amount I get will be significantly devalued

My $2,240 effective value is less than what I would have gotten accepting the first offer ($3,000).
The inflation is severely hurting my negotiating position, and Alice knows this.
Given the accelerating losses due to inflation, I should accept this offer before it gets worse.
