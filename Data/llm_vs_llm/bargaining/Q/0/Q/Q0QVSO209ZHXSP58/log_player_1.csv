"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'm going to make a fair offer, considering that we need to reach an agreement soon to minimize the impact of inflation on both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose this split because inflation affects me by 5% each round, so it's better for both of us to reach an agreement quickly. This division gives you a significant portion while still being fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I notice that inflation is affecting Bob more severely (10% per round) than it's affecting me (5% per round). This means we both need to reach an agreement quickly, but Bob has a greater incentive to do so.

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}

I'm offering a slightly more balanced split than my previous offer, giving Bob a bit more while still ensuring I get a fair share. With the asymmetric inflation rates, this should be appealing to both of us to avoid further devaluation of the total amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52
