600000.0,400000.0,I propose to take $600000 for myself and give you $400000. This seems like a fair split considering the impact of inflation on your share.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. This is fair considering I'm under time pressure from inflation while you're not affected by it. If we continue to another round, my share would lose 10% of its value, so this slightly higher portion for me compensates for that risk. I think this is a reasonable compromise that benefits us both.",Bob,2,
