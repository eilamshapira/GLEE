"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. This is fair considering I'm under time pressure from inflation while you're not affected by it. If we continue to another round, my share would lose 10% of its value, so this slightly higher portion for me compensates for that risk. I think this is a reasonable compromise that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
