"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose to take $600000 for myself and give you $400000. This seems like a fair split considering the impact of inflation on your share. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me consider this offer. Alice is proposing a 60/40 split in her favor. Given that inflation will reduce the value of my money by 10% each round, I need to consider whether rejecting this offer would be beneficial.

If I reject now and propose in the next round, Alice might reject my proposal, leading to further rounds and more inflation affecting my share. The $400,000 offered now would be worth more than potentially getting a larger amount in later rounds after inflation.

However, this split seems somewhat unfair given that we're starting with equal positions. I believe I can propose a more equitable split in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split that accounts for the inflation pressure I'm facing while still being fair to both of us.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. This is fair considering I'm under time pressure from inflation while you're not affected by it. If we continue to another round, my share would lose 10% of its value, so this slightly higher portion for me compensates for that risk. I think this is a reasonable compromise that benefits us both.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the impact of inflation on your share. Let's split it 55/45 in my favor this time. This way, we both get a fair deal considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. Alice is now proposing a 55/45 split in her favor, giving me $450,000.

Due to the inflation, my share is now worth 19% less than it would have been in round 1. If I reject this offer and we go to another round, inflation will increase to 27.1% (compounding 10% each round), further reducing the value of any money I receive.

In round 1, Alice offered me $400,000. This current offer of $450,000 is better than her initial offer, even accounting for the 19% inflation (450,000 Ã— 0.81 = $364,500).

If I reject and make a counteroffer, Alice might reject again, and we'd lose more value to inflation. Given the inflation pressure I'm facing, accepting this offer seems reasonable at this point.
