5000.0,5000.0,"I propose a fair 50-50 split. This gives us both equal amounts, which seems most fair. Note that due to the inflation affecting me, I'm already taking a risk by making a counter-offer, so this even split respects both our interests.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Alice, I understand we both want to maximize our gains, but I'm facing significant pressure from inflation (27% loss by now). This 45/55 split acknowledges your advantage while still giving me a fair amount. If we keep going back and forth, inflation will reduce the total value for both of us. Let's settle on this reasonable compromise.",Bob,4,
