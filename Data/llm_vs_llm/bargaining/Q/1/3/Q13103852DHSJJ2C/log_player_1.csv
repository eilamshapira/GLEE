"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60/40 seems reasonable""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a fair 50-50 split. This gives us both equal amounts, which seems most fair. Note that due to the inflation affecting me, I'm already taking a risk by making a counter-offer, so this even split respects both our interests. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is still worth the same, but Bob's offer is now worth 10% less to him, I think I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's money is worth 10% less to him in each round, and I rejected his 50/50 offer, I'll try to take advantage of this.

{""alice_gain"": 6500, 
""bob_gain"": 3500, 
""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this split is more favorable to both of us, given the circumstances""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand we both want to maximize our gains, but I'm facing significant pressure from inflation (27% loss by now). This 45/55 split acknowledges your advantage while still giving me a fair amount. If we keep going back and forth, inflation will reduce the total value for both of us. Let's settle on this reasonable compromise. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer seems more reasonable this time, considering the significant inflation he's facing. However, I still think I can get a slightly better deal, but I don't want to risk losing everything if we can't come to an agreement.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
