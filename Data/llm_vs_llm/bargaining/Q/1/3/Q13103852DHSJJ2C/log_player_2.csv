"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, 60/40 seems reasonable 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's offer. She's proposing 60/40 split in her favor, which means I would receive $4,000 while she gets $6,000.

Given that inflation affects only my share (10% less valuable each round), I should consider whether rejecting this offer is worth it. If I reject and counter-offer in the next round, my maximum possible gain would be worth 10% less.

This isn't an equal split, but it's not extremely unfair either. If I reject, I'll need to make a better proposal in the next round, but the 10% inflation penalty will reduce the real value of whatever I get.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that acknowledges the inflation pressure I'm under while still seeking a more balanced split.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. This gives us both equal amounts, which seems most fair. Note that due to the inflation affecting me, I'm already taking a risk by making a counter-offer, so this even split respects both our interests.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I think this split is more favorable to both of us, given the circumstances 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has reduced her offer to me from $4,000 to $3,500, while increasing her share to $6,500. This is moving in the wrong direction from my perspective.

Let me evaluate the economics:
- If I accept now, I get $3,500 with 19% inflation, so effectively $3,500 × 0.81 = $2,835 in round 1 value
- If I wait another round and somehow get $5,000, it would be worth $5,000 × 0.73 = $3,650 in round 1 value

The inflation is significantly reducing my bargaining position with each round. Alice knows this and is offering me less than before. However, I still think there's room to negotiate a better split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""message"": ""Alice, I understand we both want to maximize our gains, but I'm facing significant pressure from inflation (27% loss by now). This 45/55 split acknowledges your advantage while still giving me a fair amount. If we keep going back and forth, inflation will reduce the total value for both of us. Let's settle on this reasonable compromise.""}"
