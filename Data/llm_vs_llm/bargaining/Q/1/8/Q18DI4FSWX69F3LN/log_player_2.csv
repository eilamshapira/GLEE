"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the million dollars with $700K for me and $300K for you. Considering that the money loses 20% of its value for you in every subsequent round, this offer gives you a strong position now. I believe this is a fair dealâ€”let's settle it immediately without further devaluation. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think carefully about Alice's offer and the game mechanics:

Alice is offering me $300,000 out of the $1,000,000.

If I reject and we go to the next round:
- The money will be worth 20% less to me (so $1,000,000 becomes effectively worth $800,000 to me)
- The money will be worth 10% less to Alice (so $1,000,000 becomes effectively worth $900,000 to her)
- I would get to make the next proposal

Given that I'll lose 20% of the value if I reject, I should only reject if I believe I can secure significantly more than $300,000 in the next round to offset this loss.

While I could propose a better split for myself in the next round, Alice could reject, leading to further devaluation. The asymmetric inflation rates (20% for me vs 10% for Alice) put me at a disadvantage in prolonged negotiations.

$300,000 now is better than a risky chance at more later, considering the steep 20% devaluation per round for me.
