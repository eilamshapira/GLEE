"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm proposing a more balanced split considering our inflation rates. With your 20% inflation rate per round versus my 5%, you have more incentive to reach an agreement now. This offer gives you $375000 which is worth more to you now than waiting for a potentially larger amount in a future round. Let's conclude this deal. 
# Alice gain: 375000 
# Bob gain: 625000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
