"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I take a bit more considering the inflation rate. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

Alice is offering me $350,000 out of the $1,000,000, while she takes $650,000.

I need to consider the inflation factors:
- If I reject, the money will be worth 5% less to me in the next round
- For Alice, the money will be worth 20% less in the next round

This gives me significant leverage. If we go to the next round, I can make a better offer that Alice would still be likely to accept due to her much higher inflation penalty.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counterproposal that accounts for our different inflation rates.

{""bob_gain"": 625000, 
""alice_gain"": 375000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I'm proposing a more balanced split considering our inflation rates. With your 20% inflation rate per round versus my 5%, you have more incentive to reach an agreement now. This offer gives you $375,000 which is worth more to you now than waiting for a potentially larger amount in a future round. Let's conclude this deal.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my friend, I understand the inflation differences, but your offer was too low.  Let's be reasonable. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer carefully:

Alice is now offering me $450,000, which is $100,000 more than her first offer.

Considering inflation:
- At this point, my money is worth 9.75% less than in round 1
- Alice's money is worth 36% less than in round 1

If I reject and we go to round 4:
- My money will be worth about 14.75% less than round 1
- Alice's money will be worth about 56% less than round 1

Given the large inflation difference, I have leverage, but Alice has significantly improved her offer. The $450,000 now is still better than potentially getting more in the next round after accounting for my inflation.
