4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, since your money devalues faster (20% per round vs my 5%), we both benefit from a quick agreement. This is a fair split given our different inflation rates. If we delay, we both lose value.",Bob,2,

4200.0,5800.0,"Alice, the inflation rates significantly favor me waiting (my 5% vs your 20% per round). Your money has already lost 36% of value, while mine only 9.75%. This offer is actually better for you than continuing to negotiate, as further delays hurt you much more than me. Let's settle now.",Bob,4,
