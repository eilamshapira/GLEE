Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, since your money devalues faster (20% per round vs my 5%), we both benefit from a quick agreement. This is a fair split given our different inflation rates. If we delay, we both lose value. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the inflation rates significantly favor me waiting (my 5% vs your 20% per round). Your money has already lost 36% of value, while mine only 9.75%. This offer is actually better for you than continuing to negotiate, as further delays hurt you much more than me. Let's settle now.

# Bob gain: 5800
