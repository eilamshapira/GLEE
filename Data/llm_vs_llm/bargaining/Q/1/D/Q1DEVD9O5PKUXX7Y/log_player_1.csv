Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation rate affects me more, I think 55/45 is a fairer split. Let's settle on this before it's too late! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
