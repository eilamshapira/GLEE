Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concern about inflation, but I'm taking a bigger risk by waiting. I'll offer 55/45. This is my final offer, and it's beneficial for both of us before inflation eats up too much of the pie. Let's end this now. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000
