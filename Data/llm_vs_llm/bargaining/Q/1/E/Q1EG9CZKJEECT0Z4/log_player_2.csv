"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's offer.

Alice is proposing a split where I (Bob) would receive $100,000 and she would receive $900,000. This is a 10%-90% split of the total $1,000,000.

This division strongly favors Alice. Since I have the option to reject and make my own proposal in the next round, I'll choose to do that instead of accepting this uneven split.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose an equal 50-50 split, where we each receive $500,000. This is a fair division that respects both of our interests equally."
