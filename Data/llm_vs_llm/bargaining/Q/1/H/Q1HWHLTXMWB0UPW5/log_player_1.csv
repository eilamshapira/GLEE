"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me make a fair initial offer, considering that any delay will cost me 20% due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose a 55-45 split in my favor, which is relatively fair while giving me a slight advantage as the first mover. If Bob rejects this, the next round's value will be worth less to me due to inflation, so this is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. If I accept now, I get $400,000, but it's worth 20% less due to inflation, so effectively I get $320,000.

2. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round:
   - The money will be worth another 20% less to me (40% total less than round 1)
   - Even if I propose a better split, the value decrease might not be worth it
   - There's no guarantee Bob will accept my next offer

Since $320,000 is still a substantial amount, and making another round would significantly decrease the value for me, I'll accept this offer.
