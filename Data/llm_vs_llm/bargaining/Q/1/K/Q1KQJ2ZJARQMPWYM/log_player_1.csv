"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your spirit of fairness. However, considering the differing devaluation rates (your $10% per round versus my $5%), if we delay, you risk a relatively larger loss. In light of that, I propose I receive $6900 and you get $3100. This division reflects the fact that by waiting you’d face a steeper discount on your share, so please accept this offer to secure the best outcome for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 3100 
# Bob gain: 6900

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know we’re both feeling the pinch from inflation – every round further erodes our hard-earned dollars. If we delay any further, your share loses 10% per round (compounded) and mine 5%, hurting you more in the long run. To avoid further losses, I’m offering a division where I take $4512 and you get $5488. This means today you secure an effective value of about $5488 × 0.729 ≈ $4000, which I believe is close to what you could hope for if you wait, but without the extra loss. Let’s settle now and both preserve as much value as possible. 
# Alice gain: 5488 
# Bob gain: 4512
