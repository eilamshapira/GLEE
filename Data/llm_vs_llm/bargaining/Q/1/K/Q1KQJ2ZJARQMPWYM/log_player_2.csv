Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I propose I take $6000 and you take $4000.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6900, ""alice_gain"": 3100, ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your spirit of fairness. However, considering the differing devaluation rates (your $10% per round versus my $5%), if we delay, you risk a relatively larger loss. In light of that, I propose I receive $6900 and you get $3100. This division reflects the fact that by waiting you’d face a steeper discount on your share, so please accept this offer to secure the best outcome for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given that we're both facing losses due to inflation, I propose we split the $10000 more evenly this time. I take $5500 and you take $4500, which still values my share fairly. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4512, ""alice_gain"": 5488, ""message"": ""Alice, I know we’re both feeling the pinch from inflation – every round further erodes our hard-earned dollars. If we delay any further, your share loses 10% per round (compounded) and mine 5%, hurting you more in the long run. To avoid further losses, I’m offering a division where I take $4512 and you get $5488. This means today you secure an effective value of about $5488 × 0.729 ≈ $4000, which I believe is close to what you could hope for if you wait, but without the extra loss. Let’s settle now and both preserve as much value as possible.""}"
