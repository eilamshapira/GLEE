"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer to divide the $1,000,000 with Bob, considering the different rates of inflation for each of us.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This acknowledges that while we both face inflation, your rate is significantly higher at 20% compared to my 5%, making earlier agreements more valuable to you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a revised offer that accounts for our inflation differences and the progression of the game.

{""alice_gain"": 520000, 
""bob_gain"": 480000}

I propose a 52-48 split. Since Bob's inflation rate is much higher (20% vs my 5% per round), it makes sense for us to find a more balanced agreement quickly. This offer gives Bob a substantial increase from my initial proposal while still providing me with a fair share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 440000 
# Bob gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
