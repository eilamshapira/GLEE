Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer, slightly better for you 
# Bob gain: 4200

Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 36% less, I need to consider the actual value. 
The original value of $4200 is now worth $4200 * (1 - 0.36) = $2688 to me.
Considering this, I will reject the offer.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Due to inflation, the money I gain is worth 36% less in round 3, and now another 20% less in round 4, so it's worth 36% + 20% = 56% less than in the first round, but since it's compounded: 1 - (0.36 + 0.20 - 0.36 * 0.20) = 1 - 0.512 = 0.488 or 51.2% less.
The original value of my gain is now worth (1 - 0.512) = 0.488 times its original value.
Considering this, I will make an offer.
