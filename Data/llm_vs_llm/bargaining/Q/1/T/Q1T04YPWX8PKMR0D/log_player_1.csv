"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. Considering the effect of inflation in later rounds, I'll aim for a reasonable but advantageous offer for myself.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob's offer gives me $45. If I reject, the money is worth 10% less in the next round, and I risk getting an even worse offer. Let's calculate: $45 now is better than, say, 50% of $90 in the next round, which would be $45. Therefore, I should accept.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
