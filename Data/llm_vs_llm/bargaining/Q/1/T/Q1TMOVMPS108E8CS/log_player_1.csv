"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand inflation is harder on you, but a 55-45 split feels fairer considering my inflation rate is lower. Let's find a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a counter-offer since Bob's proposal would give me less value considering the higher inflation rate I face. The longer we negotiate, the worse it gets for both of us, but especially for me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58,
