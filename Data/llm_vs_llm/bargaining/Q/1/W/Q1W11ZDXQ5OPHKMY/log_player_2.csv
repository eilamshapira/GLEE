"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice has offered a 50-50 split of $10,000, which would give me $5,000.

If I reject and move to the next round:
- Due to 5% inflation, the $10,000 pot would be worth less to me
- I could propose a different split, but Alice would have to accept it
- If Alice rejects my proposal, the money would be worth even less in round 3 due to inflation

Given that:
1. This is a fair split
2. The value will only decrease with time
3. There's no guarantee Alice would accept a better offer from me

I should accept this offer now rather than risk getting less value in future rounds.
