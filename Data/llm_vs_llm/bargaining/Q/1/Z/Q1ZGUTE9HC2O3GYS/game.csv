50.0,50.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but a 60-40 split seems a bit unbalanced. Since inflation will reduce your $50 value by 20% if you reject (making it worth $40 to you), this 50-50 split is actually fair. You get more actual dollars than if we continue to another round where inflation affects you further.",Bob,2,
