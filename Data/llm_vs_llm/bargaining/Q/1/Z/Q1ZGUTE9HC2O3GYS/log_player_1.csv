"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but a 60-40 split seems a bit unbalanced. Since inflation will reduce your $50 value by 20% if you reject (making it worth $40 to you), this 50-50 split is actually fair. You get more actual dollars than if we continue to another round where inflation affects you further. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this carefully:
1. If I accept now, I get $50, but due to 20% inflation in round 2, this is actually worth $40 to me
2. If I reject and make a new offer, any amount I get will be worth another 20% less in round 3
3. Bob is correct that rejecting would put me in an even worse position due to compounding inflation
4. The 50-50 split, even with the inflation effect, is better than what I'm likely to get in future rounds
