"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a fair 60-40 split in my favor, considering I have more urgency due to inflation affecting my gains in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. The inflation factor makes this interesting.

For me as Bob, there's no inflation, so $40 now is worth $40 to me. If I reject and we go to another round, I could propose a different split, but Alice would experience 20% inflation on her value.

If I make a counter-offer in the next round, I could propose a more favorable split for me, knowing that for Alice, the money will be worth 20% less. This gives me some negotiating leverage.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but a 60-40 split seems a bit unbalanced. Since inflation will reduce your $50 value by 20% if you reject (making it worth $40 to you), this 50-50 split is actually fair. You get more actual dollars than if we continue to another round where inflation affects you further.""}"
