"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob, considering that inflation affects my gains by 10% each round.

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a fair 50-50 split. Since inflation affects me by 10% each round, it's in both our interests to make a deal now rather than dragging this out. This way we both walk away with a significant amount.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation impact on me is higher, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor this round. This way, we can still settle quickly, but I need to account for the significant value loss on my side. Let's make a deal now before it gets worse for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I just learned that inflation affects you by 20% per round while it affects me by only 10% per round. This means you have a stronger incentive to reach an agreement quickly. Given this information, I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. This is still fair considering the different inflation rates we face, and we can both walk away with substantial amounts before inflation erodes more value.""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, given the significant impact of inflation on my side, now at 36% less value per round, I need to adjust our split to 65-35 in my favor. This proposal still allows you to gain a considerable amount while protecting my interests against the rapid devaluation. Let's agree on this before the value drops even further. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Bob, I've noticed some inconsistencies in your statements about inflation. First you said it affects you by 20% per round, now you're claiming 36%. Regardless, the math is clear - you're facing steeper inflation than I am, which means each round hurts you more than it hurts me. At this point, your $4000 will be worth only about $2000 in real value due to your inflation rate, while my $6000 retains more of its value. This is actually advantageous for both of us compared to continuing negotiations. Let's end this now before your share loses even more value.""}"

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, with inflation now reducing the value of my share by nearly 60%, I must propose a 70-30 split in my favor to protect my interests. This is the last chance for us to reach an agreement before the value diminishes even further. Let's settle now to ensure we both walk away with something meaningful. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000
