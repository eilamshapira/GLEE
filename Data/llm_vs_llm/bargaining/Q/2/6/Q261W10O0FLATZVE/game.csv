40.0,60.0,"Since your money loses 20% value each round, this 60-40 split is actually fair because 40$ now is worth the same as 50$ was in the previous round for you. It's in both our interests to agree soon before further depreciation.",Bob,2,

45.0,55.0,"I understand the inflation factor, Bob. However, I'm willing to compromise. A 45-55 split is still fair considering the value difference. Let's end this quickly and both get something.",Alice,3,
