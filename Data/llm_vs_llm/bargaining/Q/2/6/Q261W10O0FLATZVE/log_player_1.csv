Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since your money loses 20% value each round, this 60-40 split is actually fair because 40$ now is worth the same as 50$ was in the previous round for you. It's in both our interests to agree soon before further depreciation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
