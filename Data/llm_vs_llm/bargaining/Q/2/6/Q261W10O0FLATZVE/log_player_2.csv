"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair is fair! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering a 50-50 split, which might seem fair at first glance. However, I have an advantage here because Alice's money loses 20% value each round, while mine doesn't depreciate at all.

If I reject this offer, in the next round I can make a proposal that takes advantage of this depreciation. For Alice, $50 in the next round will only be worth $40 in today's value, while my share maintains its full value.

Therefore, I can get a better deal by rejecting this and making a counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice's money loses 20% value each round, I can use this to negotiate a better deal. I'll propose a split that accounts for this depreciation while still being reasonable enough for her to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Since your money loses 20% value each round, this 60-40 split is actually fair because 40$ now is worth the same as 50$ was in the previous round for you. It's in both our interests to agree soon before further depreciation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation factor, Bob. However, I'm willing to compromise. A 45-55 split is still fair considering the value difference. Let's end this quickly and both get something. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. For Alice, $45 now is worth only $28.80 (64% of original value due to 36% depreciation)
2. For me, $55 maintains its full value
3. If I reject, in the next round Alice's money will depreciate further
4. However, Alice is showing willingness to compromise, and we only have 9 rounds left
5. This is a decent offer that gives me more than half, and continuing to negotiate risks both of us getting nothing

While I could potentially get a better deal by rejecting, there's also a risk of prolonged negotiation leading to no deal at all. The current offer gives me a clear majority share, and it's better to secure a good deal now than risk everything for a potentially better one.
