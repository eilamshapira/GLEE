"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's split the money fairly. I propose I take $55 and you take $45. This is a good deal for both of us! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $45 out of $100
2. If I reject, we go to next round where I can make an offer
3. However, due to 10% inflation, the money will be worth less for me in the next round
4. Current offer: $45 real value
5. If I reject and offer something next round, even if I ask for more, it will be worth 10% less

Since this is the first round and the offer is reasonably fair (45/55 split), considering the inflation penalty for waiting, I should accept this offer. Getting $45 now is better than risking a lower real value in subsequent rounds.
