"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which is perfectly fair
2. I know my money won't lose value in future rounds
3. However, being first to propose, Alice might be willing to offer more if I reject
4. But there's also a risk she might offer less in retaliation

Given that this is a fair offer and there's no guarantee of getting a better deal, I'll accept.
