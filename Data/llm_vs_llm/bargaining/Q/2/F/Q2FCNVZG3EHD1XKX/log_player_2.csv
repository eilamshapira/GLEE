"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly down the middle, 50-50. It's a good start for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $5000 for me
2. If I reject and go to next round:
   * The money will be worth 20% less to me
   * I could offer something better, but Alice would also have to accept
   * Maximum I could get in next round would be worth 8000 * 0.8 = $6400

While I could potentially get more by rejecting and making a counter-offer, there's risk involved. Alice's depreciation rate is only 5%, so she might be more patient. A 50-50 split is fair, and the money is worth most now.
