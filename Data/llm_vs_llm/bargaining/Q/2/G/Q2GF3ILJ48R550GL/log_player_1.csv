Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my offer to divide the $1,000,000.

I propose an equal split of the money. This is fair to both of us, and we can both walk away with a significant amount. If we continue to the next round, the total value will decrease by 20%, leaving only $800,000 to divide. It's in both our interests to agree now and maximize our combined outcome."
