"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this division is fair considering the time value of money. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing that I get $400,000 while she gets $600,000. 

Given that inflation reduces the value by 20% each round for me, if I reject this offer, the total value in the next round would be worth only $800,000 to me. Even if I were to propose a 50-50 split in round 2 ($500,000 each), my share would be worth only $400,000 after accounting for inflation (80% of $500,000).

Since Alice's current offer gives me $400,000, which is equivalent to what I'd get in the best-case scenario in the next round, and there's risk Alice might reject my counter-offer, the rational choice is to accept this offer.
