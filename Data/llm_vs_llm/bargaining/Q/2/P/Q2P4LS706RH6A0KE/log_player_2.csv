"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's proposal to give me $1000 and herself $9000 out of the $10,000 total.

This is a very uneven split that heavily favors Alice. Since we have 12 rounds available, I can reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round. A more equitable division would be preferable, and I have an opportunity to suggest that.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more balanced counter-offer.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I propose we split the $10,000 equally, with each of us receiving $5,000. This is a fair division that treats both of us equally."
