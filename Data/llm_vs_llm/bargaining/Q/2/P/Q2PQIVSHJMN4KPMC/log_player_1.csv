"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, but considering that inflation will affect future rounds for me, I'll aim for a slightly higher portion.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this division because it's close to a fair split while accounting for potential inflation risk if Bob declines and we need more rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 572500 
# Bob gain: 427500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. The offer gives me $572,500, but due to 5% inflation, it's actually worth $543,875 to me
2. This is slightly less than what I offered in round 1 ($550,000)
3. However, if I reject, the next round will have another 5% inflation for me
4. We only have 10 rounds left, and continued rejection could lead to both of us getting nothing
5. This is a reasonable offer considering the inflation penalty I'm facing
