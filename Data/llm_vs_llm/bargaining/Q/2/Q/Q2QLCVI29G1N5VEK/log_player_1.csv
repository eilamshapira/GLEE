"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split to start the negotiation.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose we split the money equally - $50 each. This is a fair and reasonable division that benefits both of us equally."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Bob is offering me $40 while taking $60
2. For Bob, due to 20% inflation, his $60 is actually worth $48 in round 1 terms
3. For me, $40 is still worth $40 as I'm not affected by inflation
4. While this offer gives me less than my initial proposal, it's not terribly unfair given Bob's inflation penalty

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While I get less than my initial proposal, the difference isn't large enough to risk further rounds where Bob's inflation might lead to more aggressive proposals."
