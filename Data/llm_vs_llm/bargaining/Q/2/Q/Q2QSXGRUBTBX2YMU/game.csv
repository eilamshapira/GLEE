2083.33,7916.67,"Hi Bob, I’m proposing that I take $2083.33 and you get $7916.67. Given that with each passing round my money loses 20% of its value while yours only loses 5%, it makes sense for both of us to settle promptly. I believe this split reflects our differing time preferences and is fair if we agree immediately. Let’s conclude the deal now.",Alice,1,

1800.0,8200.0,"Alice, I understand your concern about the differing inflation rates. However, I believe my offer of $8200 for me and $1800 for you is more equitable, considering the impact of inflation on our shares. Let's settle this round to maximize our gains.",Bob,2,
