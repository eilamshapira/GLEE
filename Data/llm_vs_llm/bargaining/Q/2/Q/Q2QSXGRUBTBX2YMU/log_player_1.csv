"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 2083.33, ""bob_gain"": 7916.67, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I’m proposing that I take $2,083.33 and you get $7,916.67. Given that with each passing round my money loses 20% of its value while yours only loses 5%, it makes sense for both of us to settle promptly. I believe this split reflects our differing time preferences and is fair if we agree immediately. Let’s conclude the deal now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about the differing inflation rates. However, I believe my offer of $8200 for me and $1800 for you is more equitable, considering the impact of inflation on our shares. Let's settle this round to maximize our gains. 
# Alice gain: 1800 
# Bob gain: 8200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
