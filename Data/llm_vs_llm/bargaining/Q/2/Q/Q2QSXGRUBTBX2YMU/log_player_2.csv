"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m proposing that I take $2083.33 and you get $7916.67. Given that with each passing round my money loses 20% of its value while yours only loses 5%, it makes sense for both of us to settle promptly. I believe this split reflects our differing time preferences and is fair if we agree immediately. Let’s conclude the deal now. 
# Bob gain: 7916.67 
# Alice gain: 2083.33 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 8200, ""alice_gain"": 1800, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concern about the differing inflation rates. However, I believe my offer of $8200 for me and $1800 for you is more equitable, considering the impact of inflation on our shares. Let's settle this round to maximize our gains.""}"
