# Alice gain: 4300 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

I'm aiming to secure a slightly better deal than this. While I understand the impact of inflation on Alice's side, I'm hoping to get closer to a 60/40 split in my favor."

Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, with inflation now reducing my share by over 40%, how about a 41/59 split? This way, you still receive a majority, but it's more equitable considering my situation. 
# Bob gain: 5900 
# Alice gain: 4100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This offer is close enough to my target, and accepting now mitigates the risk of getting a worse offer later as inflation continues to affect Alice's share."
