"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly! I propose 60/40 in my favor. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 60/40 split in her favor, which would give me $40. If I reject this offer, I'll be able to make a counter-proposal in the next round, but the money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation.

If I reject and propose in the next round, I'd be working with effectively $80 of value (for me). Even if I managed to get a better percentage split, the total value to me would be reduced.

Given the inflation penalty, the 40/60 split now is probably better than waiting for a potentially better percentage of a smaller pie.
