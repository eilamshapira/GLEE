"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000 pot. If I reject, the money will be worth 5% less to me in the next round, but 20% less to Alice. This gives me some leverage since she loses value much faster than I do.

Given that:
1. It's only round 1 of 12 possible rounds
2. Alice will lose value much faster than me (20% vs 5%)
3. The split gives Alice a significantly larger share (60%)
4. I can make a counter-offer next round

I believe I can get a better deal by rejecting this offer and making my own proposal next round.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice loses 20% value per round compared to my 5%, I'll propose a more favorable split for me, but still reasonable enough that she might accept rather than risk further devaluation.

For Alice, the money is now worth 80% of original value, while for me it's 95%.

""message"": ""Given the different inflation rates affecting us, this is a fair split that benefits us both more than further delays would.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer considering inflation impact 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has increased my share slightly from her first offer ($400K to $420K)
2. Current value to me: $420K * (1 - 0.0975) = $379,050
3. For Alice: $580K * (1 - 0.36) = $371,200

If I reject:
- Next round my inflation will be around 15% total
- Alice's inflation will be around 56% total
- I can make another proposal

The gap between our inflation rates (20% vs 5% per round) continues to work in my favor. Alice's money is devaluing much faster than mine, which means her bargaining position weakens more quickly. Even though she increased my share, I think I can still get a better deal by waiting, as she's losing value much faster than I am.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given how Alice's value is decreasing much faster than mine (she's at 64% while I'm at 90.25% of original value), I'll propose a split that reflects this changing bargaining power while still being acceptable enough that she might take it rather than risk further severe devaluation.

{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""With your value decreasing at 20% per round versus my 5%, this split actually gives you more real value than you'd get from further delays. Let's conclude this now before further devaluation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Still willing to compromise, but need a fairer split 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Real value for me: $440K * (1 - 0.1855) = $358,380
2. Real value for Alice: $560K * (1 - 0.5904) = $229,376

The current situation is interesting because:
- Alice's value is deteriorating very rapidly (almost 60% loss)
- My value loss is much more modest (about 19% loss)
- Alice has only increased my share slightly to $440K
- We're at round 5 of 12, so there's still time

Given that Alice's money is devaluing almost 3 times faster than mine, and we still have 7 rounds left, I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. The severe asymmetry in our inflation rates gives me increasing leverage with each round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","At this point, Alice's value has decreased to about 41% of original while mine is at about 81.45%. Her rapid value loss (20% per round) versus my slower loss (5% per round) puts me in an increasingly stronger negotiating position. However, I need to make an offer that she might actually accept to avoid further rounds of devaluation for both of us.

{""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Consider that your share is already worth less than $150K in real value to you due to your 59% devaluation. This offer, if accepted now, would give you more real value than a larger share would be worth after further rounds of 20% devaluation. Let's conclude this now.""}"
