"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a division that takes into account that Bob's money loses 20% value each round. Since I can get a better deal by making him wait, I'll start with a somewhat favorable split for me.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I offer you $60 and Bob gets $40. This is a fair starting point considering the time pressure on Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Bob offered a 50-50 split
2. For Bob, the $50 is now worth only $40 (20% less) in round 1 value
3. For me, the $50 is still worth $50
4. If I reject, I can make another offer in round 3, where Bob's money will be worth even less (40% less than round 1)
5. Given that I can get a better deal in the next round due to Bob's inflation penalty, I should reject this offer

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since we're now in round 3, Bob's money is worth 40% less to him than in round 1. This gives me significant leverage. Bob should be more motivated to accept now since waiting further will decrease his money's value even more.

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I offer you $70 and Bob gets $30. Given that Bob's $30 is actually worth only $18 to him (due to 40% depreciation), he should be motivated to accept this offer rather than risk further depreciation in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob offered me $60 and wants $40
2. For Bob, the $40 is now worth only about $20.48 (48.8% less) in round 1 value
3. For me, the $60 is still worth full value
4. If I reject, I can make another offer in round 5, where Bob's money will be worth even less (about 59% less than round 1)
5. However, $60 is a decent offer for me, and there's some risk in continuing further
6. Given that I'm getting a good portion ($60) and Bob is already taking a significant loss on his portion, this seems like a reasonable deal to accept
