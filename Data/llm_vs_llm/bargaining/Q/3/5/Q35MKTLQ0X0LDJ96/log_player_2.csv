"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze this offer. If I accept, I get $40. If I reject, the money loses 5% of its value *to me* each round, and I have to hope Alice makes a better offer later. I have 11 rounds remaining.

Let's think about a worst-case scenario. Suppose I keep rejecting until the last round (round 12). In that round, even if I get to propose taking *everything* that's left, the value to me will be significantly diminished due to inflation.

To calculate the value of $100 after 11 rounds of 5% inflation for me:

$100 * (0.95)^11 = $100 * 0.5688 = $56.88

This tells me that even in the last round, if I am able to propose taking the entire amount, it's only worth $56.88 to me in today's money.

Therefore, receiving $40 right now is a decent starting point. I don't want to be too greedy at the start.
