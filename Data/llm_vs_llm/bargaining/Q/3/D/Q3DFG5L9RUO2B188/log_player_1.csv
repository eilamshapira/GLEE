"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an initial offer to Bob. Since I know there's inflation affecting Bob (but not me), I'll propose a fair division, considering we still have many rounds left.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose we split the money equally - $500,000 each. This is a fair division that respects both our interests."
