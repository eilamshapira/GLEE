"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to make an offer to Bob, keeping in mind the decreasing value of the money for me with each round. To start, I'll make a relatively fair offer, hoping to secure a deal quickly.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 10000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a terrible offer! I understand Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation affecting my gains, but accepting this would mean getting nothing. I will reject this and make a more reasonable offer in the next round.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's my turn again. Remembering that my gains are now worth 10% less than the initial value (5% less per round), I need to balance getting a reasonable amount with the increasing risk of further devaluation. I'll try to find a middle ground.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 9500 
# Bob gain: 500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob is starting to understand the pressure of the decreasing value of my potential gains. 9500$ is quite a lot. However, I will calculate the exact value for me to make the best decision.
The money is now worth 14.26% less for me.

9500 * (1 - 0.1426) = 9500 * 0.8574 = 8145.3

So, this proposal from Bob effectively gives me 8145.3$.
I will accept this offer.

""decision"": ""accept""
