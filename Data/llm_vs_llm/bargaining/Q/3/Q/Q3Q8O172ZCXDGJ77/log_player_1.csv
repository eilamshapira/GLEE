"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer that takes the inflation effect into account, since each passing round makes the money worth 10% less for me but doesn't affect Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest this division because it gives both of us a fair share of the money. If we go to another round, the total value decreases for me due to 10% inflation, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to be strategic about this offer given the inflation effect. Since we're now in round 3, the money I receive is worth 20% less than in round 1.

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}

I'm offering a more balanced split that still gives me a slight advantage, but is more favorable to Bob than my initial offer. Given that inflation is reducing the value of my share with each round, I hope we can come to an agreement now, as further delays would reduce the effective value of my portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","The inflation is significantly impacting the value of my share now. In this fifth round, the money I receive is worth about 34.4% less than in round 1. I need to adjust my strategy accordingly.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing an even 50-50 split. This is a fair division that gives us equal amounts. Considering the inflation effect on my share, this is a reasonable compromise, and I hope Bob will accept it so we can conclude the negotiation without further devaluation of my portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60
