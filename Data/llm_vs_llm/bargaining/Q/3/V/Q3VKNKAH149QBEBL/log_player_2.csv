"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $400,000 while she takes $600,000 of the $1 million. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but the money will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation (so the total would effectively be worth $900,000 to me).

If I counter-offer in the next round, I could propose a more favorable split, but Alice might reject it, leading to further rounds and more inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more balanced while accounting for the inflation effect.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because it gives me a better share than Alice's initial offer, while still being reasonable enough that Alice should accept it rather than moving to another round. If we go to another round, we both lose value due to inflation, so it's in our mutual interest to reach an agreement soon."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. 

Alice is now offering an even 50-50 split of the $1,000,000. However, due to inflation, the $500,000 I would receive is worth 19% less than it would have been in round 1, making it effectively worth about $405,000 to me.

If I reject and we go to round 4, inflation would reduce the value even further for both of us. Alice has also revealed that inflation is affecting her more severely (36% vs my 19%), which gives me some negotiating leverage, but also suggests we should try to conclude quickly.

Given that this is a fair split nominally, and the inflation penalty will only get worse with further rounds, I'll accept this offer.
