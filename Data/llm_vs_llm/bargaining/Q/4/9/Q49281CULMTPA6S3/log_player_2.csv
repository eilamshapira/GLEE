"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer of a 50-50 split. This is a fair division, offering me $50. However, I need to keep in mind that if I reject and we move to the next round, inflation will reduce the money's value by 10% for me. So if I counter-offer in the next round, the $100 would effectively be worth only $90 to me.
