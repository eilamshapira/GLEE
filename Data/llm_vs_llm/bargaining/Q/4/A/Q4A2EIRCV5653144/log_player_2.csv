"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $400,000 out of $1,000,000
2. If I reject, we go to the next round where:
   * I can make a counter-offer
   * But my money will be worth 10% less
   * My $400,000 would become worth $360,000 in the next round

The offer isn't great (40% for me, 60% for her), but considering:
1. The inflation penalty only affects me
2. I still get a substantial amount
3. I have negotiating power but at a cost
4. It's better to secure a good deal early than risk losing value
