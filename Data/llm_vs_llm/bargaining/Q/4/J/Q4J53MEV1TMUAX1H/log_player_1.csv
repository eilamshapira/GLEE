"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to consider the inflation for my value, which means the money is worth 20% less for me each round. This gives me an incentive to make a fair offer early, as my purchasing power decreases over time while Bob's doesn't change.

For the first round, I'll propose a fair division that slightly favors me since I'm going first:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I believe this is a reasonable starting offer that gives Bob a substantial portion while recognizing that I have the disadvantage of value depreciation in later rounds."
