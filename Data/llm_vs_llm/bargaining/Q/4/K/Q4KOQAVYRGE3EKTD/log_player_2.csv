"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the total amount will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation. So $1M becomes worth $900K from my perspective.

Current offer gives me $400K. If I reject and go to next round, even if I propose a more favorable split, the maximum I could get would be somewhat less than $900K due to having to give Alice enough to accept.

While this isn't an even 50-50 split, $400K is still a significant amount and the inflation risk makes rejecting risky.
