"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose an equal 50-50 split. This is fair for both of us, and if we keep rejecting offers, we both lose value due to the 10% inflation each round. With this split, we both walk away with equal value and avoid further depreciation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Reasoning (not part of response): I'll accept this offer because:
1. It's a fair 50-50 split
2. If I reject, the next round will be worth 10% less
3. Even if I could get a slightly better deal in the next round, the inflation penalty would likely negate any gains
4. Bob makes a valid point about avoiding further depreciation"
