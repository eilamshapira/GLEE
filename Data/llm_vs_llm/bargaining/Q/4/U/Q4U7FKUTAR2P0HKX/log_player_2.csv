"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first move. This is a fair offer considering you still get a substantial portion. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll carefully consider Alice's offer of a 60-40 split in her favor.

If I accept, I get $40 now.
If I reject, I can make my own offer next round, but the total value will decrease by 10% to $90.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counterproposal that's fair and considers the declining value of the money.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""I propose an equal 50-50 split. This is fair for both of us, and if we keep rejecting offers, we both lose value due to the 10% inflation each round. With this split, we both walk away with equal value and avoid further depreciation.""}"
