This is my first offer. I'm taking the majority of the money, but I'm still giving Bob a decent share to encourage him to accept."

I'm lowering my offer slightly to account for the inflation, but I'm still aiming for a majority of the money.  I hope this is more appealing to Bob than his previous offer."

I'm reducing my share again, but I'm still aiming for a majority. With each round, the value of the money decreases, so I need to be more flexible."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a 50/50 split.  The inflation is getting serious, and I don't want to risk getting nothing.  Hopefully, Bob will see the sense in this offer."
