Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50-50 split is fair. Since inflation doesn't affect me, I can wait, but I'd prefer we reach an equitable agreement now. This even split respects both of our interests. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
