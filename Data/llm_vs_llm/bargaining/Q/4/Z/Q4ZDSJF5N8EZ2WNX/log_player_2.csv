"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take a bit more to account for the inflation risk. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000 out of the $10,000 total. This is the first round, and I know there's no inflation for me, but she's claiming she needs more due to inflation risk.

Since we have many rounds left and the money doesn't lose value for me over time, I can afford to make a counter-offer that might be more favorable to me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50-50 split is fair. Since inflation doesn't affect me, I can wait, but I'd prefer we reach an equitable agreement now. This even split respects both of our interests.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the appeal of a 50/50 split, but inflation puts me at a real disadvantage.  Let's meet in the middle - this offer still gives you a significant share. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's updated offer. She's now proposing I get $4,500 while she gets $5,500, which is closer to an even split than her first offer. She mentions that inflation is affecting her gains (36% less value than in round 1), while my gains aren't affected by inflation.

While I could potentially get a better offer by rejecting, there's also the risk of getting less if negotiations continue for too many rounds. Alice has moved closer to my desired 50-50 split, showing she's willing to compromise.

Given that we've already used 3 of our 12 rounds, and considering her claim about inflation affecting her side, this seems like a reasonable offer that's moving in the right direction.
