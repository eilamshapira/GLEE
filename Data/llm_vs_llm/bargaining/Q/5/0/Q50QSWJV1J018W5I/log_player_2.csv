"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering me $350,000 while keeping $650,000 for herself. This is only 35% of the total amount. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but I need to consider that inflation will reduce the value by 5% each round.

Given this is the first round, I believe I can negotiate for a better split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair counter-offer that takes inflation into account. Since we're now in round 2, the money is worth 5% less to me than in round 1.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I suggest we split the money equally. This is a fair division that maximizes our combined utility. An even split of $500,000 each benefits both of us and avoids further delays that would reduce the value through inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is interesting new information. The inflation affects Alice much more severely than it affects me (36% vs. 9.75% after two rounds). This means delay is significantly more costly for her than for me.

Alice has improved her offer from $350,000 to $400,000 for me. This is a step in the right direction, but given the asymmetric inflation rates, I can likely negotiate for an even better deal.

Since Alice is losing 36% value per two rounds (approximately 18% per round) while I'm only losing about 5% per round, I have a stronger negotiating position by rejecting and continuing.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given the information that Alice faces much higher inflation costs (36% after two rounds, or roughly 18% per round) compared to my 5% per round, I have a stronger negotiating position. I'll leverage this to make an offer that's still fair but accounts for our different time pressures.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I've adjusted my proposal to take into account our different inflation rates. Since waiting is much more costly for you than for me, this division provides you with a substantial amount while recognizing my advantage in these negotiations. Accepting this offer now would be more beneficial for you than waiting for further rounds where your share would lose significantly more value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has improved her offer again to $450,000 for me. However, considering our asymmetric inflation rates, I still have the advantage in these negotiations.

After 4 rounds, Alice's money has lost 59.04% of its value while mine has only lost 18.55%. This significant difference means that Alice is under much more pressure to reach an agreement quickly.

Given that each round costs Alice substantially more than it costs me, and we're already in round 5 of 12, I'll reject this offer to see if we can reach a more favorable agreement.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given the significant difference in how inflation affects us (Alice losing value much faster than I am), I'll increase my proposal slightly to encourage acceptance while still leveraging my advantage in these negotiations.

{""bob_gain"": 580000, ""alice_gain"": 420000}

I'm offering you $420,000, which represents a significant portion of the total sum. Considering that your share loses value at a much higher rate than mine (approximately 18% per round compared to my 5%), this offer becomes increasingly attractive for you. We're now halfway through our 12 rounds, and further delays will continue to diminish your potential gains more severely than mine. This proposal represents a fair compromise that acknowledges both our positions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has improved her offer to an even split of $500,000 each, which is quite significant given our negotiation history. Let me analyze this situation:

1. We're now in round 7 of 12, which means we have 5 rounds left
2. My money has lost 26.49% of its value so far, while Alice's has lost 73.79%
3. Alice's inflation rate is much higher (approximately 18% per round vs. my 5%)
4. If I reject, I can make another offer, but we'll lose another round to inflation
5. If we continue too long, both of us risk getting nothing after round 12

Given that Alice's inflation rate is so much higher than mine, she must be very motivated to reach an agreement soon. However, this is also the first time she's offered an even split, which represents a significant concession.

While I could potentially get a slightly better deal by continuing to negotiate, there's also risk in pushing too far. I'll accept this fair offer.
