"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it reasonably now and avoid losing money to inflation. I propose 55/45, a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the rules. Let's analyze the offer, considering the inflation.

Round 1:
*   Alice's Proposal: Alice gets 550,000, Bob gets 450,000.

*   My (Bob's) perspective: Accepting gives me 450,000. Rejecting means next round, the 1,000,000 is worth 20% less to me, becoming 800,000 for me. I will be the one to propose. Even if I obtain the full 800,000, it may not be worth it due to time discounting. I will get a huge advantage in the next turn.

*   Alice's perspective: The 1,000,000 is worth 5% less to Alice, becoming 950,000.

It is too early to accept.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Okay, it's my turn. Remember, the value of the money is reduced due to inflation. The original 1,000,000 is now worth:
* To Bob: 800,000
* To Alice: 950,000

I will offer Alice just enough that it is negligibly better than waiting. This will give me the most amount. I will aim for Alice to get a little above 50%.

```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 470000,
  ""alice_gain"": 530000,
  ""message"": ""Alice, a better offer for you. Take 53% and we both win. I can only propose 47% to myself.""
}
