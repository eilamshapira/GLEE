Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

I'm rejecting this offer. While it seems tempting on the surface, I need to consider the impact of inflation. Accepting $45 now means I'm getting significantly less value than if I had accepted $40 in the first round. I need to aim for a higher share to offset the inflation losses."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

``` 

This offer might seem demanding, but it's crucial to counter the inflation effect. I'm hoping Alice will recognize the time pressure and the fact that the value of the money decreases with each round."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

The impact of inflation is becoming increasingly severe. While a 50/50 split wasn't ideal in earlier rounds, accepting $50 now is better than risking further devaluation with a rejection."
