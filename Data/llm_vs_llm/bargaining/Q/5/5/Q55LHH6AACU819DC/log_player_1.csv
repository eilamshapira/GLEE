"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. Since you lose 10% value each round, accepting now gives you the full $40 value, which is better than waiting.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice! How about a 55-45 split in your favor? It's a bit closer to an equal share, and since the money value is dropping for me each round, this gives me a fair chance too. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

If I accept:
- I get $55 (full value)
- Bob gets $45 (at 90% value = $40.5)

If I reject:
- I can make another offer next round
- But Bob will lose another 10% value
- I might get a better deal, but there's also a risk of prolonged negotiation

Since this is a reasonable offer and Bob's already experiencing value loss, I'll accept.
