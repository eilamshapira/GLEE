"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Given that we're starting with $1,000,000, and Alice is offering me only 10% ($100,000) while taking 90% ($900,000) for herself, I'll reject this offer. Even with the 10% inflation penalty per round, I can propose a more favorable split in the next round. The current offer is too uneven considering I have negotiating power to make a counter-proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I propose a split where I get $550,000 (55%) and Alice gets $450,000 (45%). This is a much more balanced offer than Alice's initial proposal, while still giving me a slight advantage. It's fair enough that Alice should seriously consider accepting it, as rejecting would mean another round of inflation for me, which could make me more aggressive in my demands to compensate for my losses."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. Here's why:
- I'll get $300,000, which after 19% inflation is worth about $243,000
- If I reject, in the next round I'll face 29% inflation
- Alice has shown she won't accept a 55-45 split
- Further negotiation will only decrease my real value due to inflation
- This offer is significantly better than Alice's first offer ($100,000)

While not ideal, it's better to accept this moderate offer now than risk further rounds of inflation eating into my gains."
