"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm going to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $4,000 while she takes $6,000 of the $10,000. This is less than half for me, but I need to remember that with each round, the value decreases by 5% for me due to inflation.

If I reject, I can make my own offer next round, but the total value to me would be reduced to $9,500 (95% of $10,000). So my maximum potential gain would be lower.

Since this is the first round and I could potentially negotiate for a better deal, I'll reject this offer and propose my own in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me but still reasonable for Alice, considering the inflation pressure I'm facing.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I propose this more balanced split where I receive $5,500 and Alice receives $4,500. This is fair because we both deserve a substantial portion of the money, and accepting now would benefit both of us by avoiding the inflation penalty in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to reconsider my position given that Alice rejected my previous offer and we're now in round 3.

Let me analyze this offer:
- Alice is offering me $4,300
- After inflation of 9.75% from the first round, this is effectively worth $3,880.75 to me
- If I reject, we move to round 4, and my inflation penalty would increase to 14.26% (5% more)
- That means in the next round, the entire $10,000 would only be worth $8,574 to me

Alice has increased her offer from $4,000 to $4,300, which shows some movement toward compromise. While it's not as much as I'd like, continuing to negotiate means risking further value loss due to inflation.

Given the inflation pressure I'm facing and that Alice has shown some willingness to compromise, I'll accept this offer.
