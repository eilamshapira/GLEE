"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

* Current offer gives me $30
* If I reject and propose next round:
  * The money will be worth 20% less
  * Maximum I could get next round would be worth $80 (100 * 0.8)
  * But Alice might reject that

Given that any future rounds will have significant inflation reducing the real value, and there's uncertainty about Alice accepting my counter-offer, this initial offer of $30 isn't great but it might be better than risking a worse outcome.

However, I think I can get a better deal by negotiating, even with the inflation penalty. I'll reject this uneven split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a more balanced split, but accounting for the fact that the money is now worth 20% less to me. To make up for this loss in value, I'll ask for a bit more than a pure 50-50 split.

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I propose this split because:
1. It compensates somewhat for my 20% value loss due to inflation
2. It's not too extreme, giving Alice a reasonable portion
3. If Alice rejects, we both lose more value in the next round"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Current offer: $40, but with 36% inflation means it's really worth $25.60 to me
2. If I reject and go to next round:
   * Money will be worth 49% less than original value
   * Even if I got a larger share, it would be significantly devalued
   * Additional negotiation rounds increase risk of ending up with less

While $40 isn't ideal, considering the severe inflation penalty I'm facing, this is probably the best realistic outcome I can get. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush, especially when those future birds are rapidly losing value.
