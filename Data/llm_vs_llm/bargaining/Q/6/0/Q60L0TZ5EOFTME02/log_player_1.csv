"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I propose a fair 60-40 split, considering that waiting will reduce the value of your share by 20% each round.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My offer is more generous than yours, considering the 20% reduction in value for me 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $45
- If I reject and propose in the next round:
  * Bob will face another 20% reduction in value
  * I could potentially get more, but Bob might reject again
  * This could lead to a cycle of rejections where we both lose value

Since $45 is still a reasonable amount and continuing the negotiation might lead to worse outcomes for both of us (especially for Bob due to his value reduction), I'll accept this offer.
