I need to aim higher. While the penalty for inflation is increasing, waiting too long is a sure way to lose a significant chunk of the potential gains."

This is no longer ideal, but the effects of inflation are becoming too significant to ignore. Taking the offer now is better than risking a worse outcome later."
