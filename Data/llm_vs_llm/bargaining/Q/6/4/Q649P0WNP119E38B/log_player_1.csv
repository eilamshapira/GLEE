"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, I need to consider that when making my decision. 

The offer of 4500 is worth 10% less to me, so it's effectively 4500 * 0.9 = 4050.

Considering this, I think I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Due to inflation, the money I gain is worth 10% less in each round. Since this is round 3, the money I gain is worth 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 of its original value.

I'll make an offer that takes this into account.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4600 
# Bob gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 27.1% less, I need to consider that when making my decision. 

The offer of 4600 is worth 72.9% of its original value to me, so it's effectively 4600 * 0.729 = 3351.4.

Considering this, I think I can get a better deal, but I also need to keep in mind that the value of the money will continue to decrease.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Due to inflation, the money I gain is worth 10% less in each round. Since this is round 5, the money I gain is worth 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.6561 of its original value.

I'll make an offer that takes this into account. I'll try to be more generous to Bob, hoping he'll accept.
