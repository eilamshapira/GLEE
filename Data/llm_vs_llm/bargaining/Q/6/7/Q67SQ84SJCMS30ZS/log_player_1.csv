"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering future inflation will affect us both, and you'll lose more value by waiting.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering I lose more value to inflation, I think a 55-45 split is more reasonable. Let's settle now before it's worth even less. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think through this:
1. If I accept now, I get $45, but it's worth 5% less, so effectively $42.75
2. If I reject and propose in the next round, any amount would be worth 10% less than original value
3. Even if I got a better split next round, both of us would lose more value
4. Bob's offer is reasonable given the inflation pressure
5. The difference between my original proposal and this one isn't worth the inflation loss
