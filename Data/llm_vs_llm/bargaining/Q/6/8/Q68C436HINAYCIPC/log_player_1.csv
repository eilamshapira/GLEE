Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. Given the inflation, it's best to wrap this up without losing value. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, since we both face inflation, let's make a fair split and take 55/45 in my favor. This way, we minimize the loss. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
