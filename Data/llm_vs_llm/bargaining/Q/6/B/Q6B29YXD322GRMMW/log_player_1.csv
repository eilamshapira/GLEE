"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to calculate the value of the money now, considering the inflation.

In round 1, I was offered $60. Due to inflation, in round 2, that same $60 is now worth 20% less.

So, the effective value of $60 in round 2 is: $60 * (1 - 0.20) = $60 * 0.80 = $48

Bob's offer is for me to get $45.

Since $45 is less than the effective value of the money I could have had ($48), I will reject this offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here is my offer for round 3. Remember, the money is worth 20% less for me compared to round 2, so the effective value is: $100 * (1 - 0.20) * (1-0.20) = $100 * 0.80 * 0.80 = $64.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this. The money is worth 48.8% less for me than in the first round. This means the effective value of $100 now is $100 * (1 - 0.488) = $100 * 0.512 = $51.20.

Bob is offering me $50.

Since $50 is less than the effective value of the total amount of money I have now ($51.20), and the game is about dividing the total amount, I should accept this offer.

```json

  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
