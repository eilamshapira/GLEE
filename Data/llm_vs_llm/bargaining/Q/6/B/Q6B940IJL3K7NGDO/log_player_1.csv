Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, the value of the money decreases. 
For me (Alice), the money is worth 20% less in each round, so in round 3, it's worth 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 of the original value.
For Bob, the money is worth 10% less in each round, so in round 3, it's worth 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 of the original value.

To make a fair offer, I'll consider these values.
