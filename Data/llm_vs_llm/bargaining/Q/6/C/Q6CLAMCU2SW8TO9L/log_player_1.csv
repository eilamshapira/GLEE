"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, considering that you face a 5% inflation penalty per round while I don't. This is actually a fair deal for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but considering the inflation impact on my side, I propose a 50-50 split this round. It's fair given the circumstances and ensures we both benefit equally from the start. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Bob's offered me $500,000, which is less than my initial proposal
2. If I reject, I can make another offer next round
3. However, Bob's money will be worth 5% less next round, so he might be less willing to accept a better deal for me
4. $500,000 is still a significant amount, and there's risk in continuing
