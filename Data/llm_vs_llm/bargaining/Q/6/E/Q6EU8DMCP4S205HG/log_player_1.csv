Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a more balanced split that's fair to both of us. This is close to a 50-50 division, giving you a slight advantage. Let's avoid the inflation penalty and make a deal now. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
