"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal! This offer gives me a significant advantage, but it still leaves you with a good amount of money. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically.

1. Alice is offering me $100,000 out of $1,000,000 (10% of the total)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 10% inflation each round, my money will be worth less if I wait
4. My $100,000 now is better than a potential larger amount that's worth less due to inflation
5. Still, this offer is quite low and I can probably negotiate better terms

Given that:
- The offer is quite unfair (90-10 split)
- I have plenty of rounds left
- Even with 10% inflation, I can still get a better deal in the next round
- First offers are typically testing the waters

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer while accounting for the fact that we both need to reach an agreement, and time is working against me due to inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""I propose a more balanced split that's fair to both of us. This is close to a 50-50 division, giving you a slight advantage. Let's avoid the inflation penalty and make a deal now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a fair deal. But letting time pass hurts both of us. This offer is a good compromise, and it's better to secure this amount now than risk losing more to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $300,000, but due to 19% inflation, it's actually worth about $243,000 to me
2. This is better than her first offer of $100,000
3. Alice seems aware of my desire for fairness but is also using the inflation pressure
4. If I reject:
   - Next round I can make an offer, but my gains will be worth 29% less
   - I'd need to offer myself significantly more to compensate for inflation
   - Alice might continue to reject, making my situation worse

While not ideal, this offer is substantially better than the first one, and the inflation is starting to significantly impact my potential gains. Getting $243,000 in real value now might be better than risking further devaluation.
