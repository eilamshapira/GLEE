5000.0,5000.0,"I propose a fair 50-50 split, which gives us both equal shares. This seems like the most equitable solution since we're both in the same position.",Alice,1,

4000.0,6000.0,"Considering the inflation, I'd like a bit more to compensate for the potential loss in future rounds. This is still a relatively fair offer.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"I understand your concern about inflation, but I also need to consider my own interests. This offer gives you a substantial amount while allowing me a fair share as well. Let's resolve this now rather than letting more rounds pass and potentially losing value for both of us.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
3500.0,6500.0,"Given the increasing impact of inflation on my share, I need to adjust my offer to ensure I get a reasonable amount. This is still a better deal for you than letting more rounds pass and risking getting nothing.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"Bob, I notice that inflation is significantly impacting your returns with each round. At this rate, future rounds will only decrease the real value of your share. This offer gives you $4000 now, which is worth more than a potentially larger nominal amount in later rounds. Let's conclude this now for our mutual benefit.",Alice,5,
