Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Bob, I notice that inflation is significantly impacting your returns with each round. At this rate, future rounds will only decrease the real value of your share. This offer gives you $4000 now, which is worth more than a potentially larger nominal amount in later rounds. Let's conclude this now for our mutual benefit.""}"
