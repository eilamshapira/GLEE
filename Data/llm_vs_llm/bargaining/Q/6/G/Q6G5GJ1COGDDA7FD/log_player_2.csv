# Alice's message: I understand your concern about inflation, but I also need to consider my own interests. This offer gives you a substantial amount while allowing me a fair share as well. Let's resolve this now rather than letting more rounds pass and potentially losing value for both of us.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I notice that inflation is significantly impacting your returns with each round. At this rate, future rounds will only decrease the real value of your share. This offer gives you $4000 now, which is worth more than a potentially larger nominal amount in later rounds. Let's conclude this now for our mutual benefit.
