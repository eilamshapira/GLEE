"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

My reasoning: I'm aiming for a split that favors me slightly, but is reasonable enough for Bob to accept. I'm starting with a 60/40 split to leave room for negotiation if needed. I am also taking into consideration the potential inflation effect on me, making a higher initial offer beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I see Bob has made a counter-offer. Let's analyze this:

*   **Bob's Offer:** Alice gets $4500, Bob gets $5500.
*   **Inflation Impact on Bob:** Bob's $5500 is now worth 10% less to him than $5500 in Round 1. This means Bob values his $5500 as the $ value of (5500 * 0.9) = $4950
*   **My Perspective:** I am getting $4500, which is less than my offer of $6000 in round 1.

My decision:

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Reasoning: While Bob's inflation may pressure him, I need to consider my own gains. My initial offer was $6000. Accepting this offer gives me $4500, a significant drop. There are still rounds left, so I will reject it."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's my turn to make an offer again. Inflation is still not affecting me. I need to be more persuasive, but also ensure I get a decent cut.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5700,
  ""bob_gain"": 4300
}
```

Reasoning:

*   **Compromise:** I'm lowering my demand from $6000 to $5700, demonstrating willingness to negotiate.
*   **Bob's Inflation:** Bob's inflation from the last round still applies. Bob gains $4300. This is worth less to him compared to $4300 in round 1.
*   **Remaining Rounds:** We still have rounds left, but it's important to secure a reasonable offer.
*   **Still Favorable to Me:** This split still gives me a majority of the funds.

I hope this is enough for Bob to accept, given the pressure he's under from inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze Bob's offer in Round 4:

*   **Bob's Offer:** Alice gets $4200, Bob gets $5800.
*   **Inflation Impact on Bob:** Bob's $5800 is now worth 27.1% less to him than $5800 in Round 1. The current value of Bob's money = $5800 * (1 - 0.271) = $5800 * 0.729 = $4228.2
*   **My Perspective:** I am getting $4200, which is even less than the $4500 in round 2.

Decision:

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Reasoning:

The inflation is hurting Bob. If I hold out, Bob will be more and more pressured to give me a higher value. However, I believe $4200 is too little, and I am not going to accept it. I will reject and make another counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's my turn again. I need to factor in Bob's increasingly difficult situation due to inflation. I need to be firm, but also be mindful of the ticking clock.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

Reasoning:

*   **Slight Concession:** I am lowering my demand from $5700 to $5500.
*   **Bob's Inflation:** Bob's inflation is now significant (27.1% from the last round). The true value of $4500 to Bob now is $4500 * 0.729 = $3280.5.
*   **More Favorable to Me:** This split continues to give me more of the money.
*   **Balance:** I'm trying to find the balance between getting a good deal for myself and giving Bob enough to accept, knowing his money is losing value quickly. I am also considering the potential rounds left.

Hopefully, the increased inflation on Bob's side, and me sacrificing a tiny bit more this round, will convince him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze Bob's offer in Round 6:

*   **Bob's Offer:** Alice gets $4000, Bob gets $6000.
*   **Inflation Impact on Bob:** Bob's $6000 is now worth 40.95% less to him than $6000 in Round 1. The current value of Bob's money = $6000 * (1 - 0.4095) = $6000 * 0.5905 = $3543.
*   **My Perspective:** I am getting $4000, which is now the lowest so far.

Decision:

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Reasoning:

Although Bob's inflation is significant, $4000 is too low. It's less than half of the original sum. I'm confident I can still negotiate for more, especially given how much Bob's money is worth to him now. I will reject and hopefully get to make a better offer next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, time to make another offer. Bob's situation is getting tougher with each round of inflation.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5300,
  ""bob_gain"": 4700
}
```

Reasoning:

*   **Small Concession:** Reduced from $5500 to $5300.
*   **Bob's Perspective:** Bob's inflation stands at 40.95%. So, $4700 is currently worth $4700 * (1 - 0.4095) = $4700 * 0.5905 = $2775.35 to him.
*   **Seven Rounds Remaining:** I have to consider the rounds left.
I think this is a good offer. I should aim to secure the best possible outcome.

I hope this is enough for Bob to accept. The inflation is strongly in my favour right now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3800 
# Bob gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze Bob's offer in Round 8:

*   **Bob's Offer:** Alice gets $3800, Bob gets $6200.
*   **Inflation Impact on Bob:** Bob's $6200 is now worth 52.17% less to him than $6200 in Round 1. The current value of Bob's money = $6200 * (1 - 0.5217) = $6200 * 0.4783 = $2965.46
*   **My Perspective:** I am getting $3800, which is the lowest yet.

Decision:

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Reasoning:

$3800 is far too low. Bob's inflation is indeed very high. If he is getting $2965.46 effectively, then the difference between what Bob gains and what I gain is high enough for me to reject. The remaining rounds allow me to seek better offers. Therefore, I will reject."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, time to make an offer in Round 9. Bob's inflation is getting extreme. I need to press my advantage, but also keep in mind the decreasing number of rounds.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5100,
  ""bob_gain"": 4900
}
```

Reasoning:

*   **Smallest Concession Yet:** I've only decreased by $200 from the previous $5300.
*   **Bob's Inflation:** Bob's inflation is now 52.17%. Therefore, $4900 for Bob is really $4900 * (1 - 0.5217) = $4900 * 0.4783 = $2343.67.
*   **Four Rounds Remaining**: The number of rounds left is very small.

I am hoping Bob accepts this offer, knowing his real gains is around $2343.67. I think I can get a bit more before it goes to waste."
