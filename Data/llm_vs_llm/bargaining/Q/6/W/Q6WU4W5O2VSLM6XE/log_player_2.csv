"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it equally. It's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

# Bob's message: I appreciate the fair offer, but considering the inflation factor, I think I should get a bit more. How about I get 5500 and you get 4500?"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think getting a bit more this round makes sense. This offer still leaves you with a substantial amount.""}

# Explanation:
Alice will keep 80% of 4500$ if she rejects the offer and the game moves to the next round.
80% of 4500 = 3600.
This means that by accepting this offer, Alice gains an additional 900$ compared to the value of her share in the next round. Therefore, Alice should accept this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concern about inflation. Let's adjust the split slightly to account for it. 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

# Bob's message: I appreciate the adjustment, but considering the inflation, I think we should split it 5300 for me and 4700 for you. This way, we both get a fair share considering the decreasing value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5300,
""alice_gain"": 4700,
""message"": ""This split takes into account the inflation and ensures we both get a fair share. If you reject, the value will decrease further, benefiting neither of us.""}

# Explanation:
If Alice rejects this offer, her share in the next round will be worth 80% of 4700 = 3760$.
This means that by accepting this offer, Alice gains an additional 940$ compared to the value of her share in the next round. Therefore, Alice should accept this offer."
