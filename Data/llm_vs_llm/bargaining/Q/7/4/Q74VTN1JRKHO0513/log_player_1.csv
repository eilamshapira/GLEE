"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly and end the game quickly to avoid losing value""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 55/45. It's still a fair division considering the round loss values. We both gain more before further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I need to calculate the actual value I'd get. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I'll calculate the value:

Original value: $4500
Inflation loss: 5% of $4500 = 0.05 * $4500 = $225
Actual value: $4500 - $225 = $4275

Bob's offer seems reasonable, but I'll think about the potential future losses if I reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 10% less (5% from Round 1 + 5% from Round 2), and the money Bob gains is worth 40% less (20% from Round 1 + 20% from Round 2).

To make a more attractive offer, I'll give Bob a bit more, but keep in mind the decreasing value.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly before the value drops further, it's a better deal for both of us""}"
