Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to compromise, but 60/40 is still too much in your favor.  I propose a 70/30 split.  Let's end this game before the inflation eats away at our potential gains.

# Alice gain: 700000
