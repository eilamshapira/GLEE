"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60-40 split in my favor since I made the first move, which is still a fair offer giving you a substantial $4000. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is proposing I get $4000, which is a significant amount. However, by rejecting, I can make my own counter-offer in the next round. The traditional game theory suggestion for ultimatum games would actually favor a more equal split.

Since I have the opportunity to counter-offer and potentially get a better deal, and since Alice's justification for taking more (making the first move) isn't particularly strong, I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split while maintaining a cooperative tone.

""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""I suggest a fair 50-50 split, which is the most equitable solution and gives us both a substantial $5000. This way, neither of us has an advantage over the other.""
