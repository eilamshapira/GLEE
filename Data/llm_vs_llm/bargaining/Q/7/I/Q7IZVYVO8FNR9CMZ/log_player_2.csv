"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 525000 
# Alice gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
* The split is relatively fair - I get 52.5% ($525,000) and Alice gets 47.5% ($475,000)
* If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but:
  * The money will be worth 20% less to me then
  * I don't know how inflation affects Alice
  * There's risk Alice rejects my counter-offer

Given that:
1. The current offer gives me a majority share
2. The inflation penalty makes future rounds less valuable
3. The split is reasonably equitable

I'll accept this offer.
