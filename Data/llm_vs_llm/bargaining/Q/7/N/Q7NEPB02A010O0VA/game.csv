400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, let's avoid further delays and potential losses. I'm proposing a quick resolution: I get $600000 and you get $400000. Accepting now secures your share without risking any unforeseen impacts in later rounds.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
520000.0,480000.0,"Counter offer: I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a little more to account for the inflation. Let's aim for a more balanced agreement.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I understand that inflation is reducing the value of your share. However, every additional round brings further losses, and waiting might not work in your favor. I'm offering you $450000 now—which, with the current inflation, is effectively worth about $406125—so you can secure a decent share rather than risk further diminishment. Let's close this deal in round 4 and avoid more erosion of value.",Bob,4,
