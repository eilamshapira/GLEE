Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's avoid further delays and potential losses. I'm proposing a quick resolution: I get $600000 and you get $400000. Accepting now secures your share without risking any unforeseen impacts in later rounds. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that inflation is reducing the value of your share. However, every additional round brings further losses, and waiting might not work in your favor. I'm offering you $450000 now—which, with the current inflation, is effectively worth about $406125—so you can secure a decent share rather than risk further diminishment. Let's close this deal in round 4 and avoid more erosion of value. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000
