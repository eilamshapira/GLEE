Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counter offer: I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a little more to account for the inflation. Let's aim for a more balanced agreement. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand that inflation is reducing the value of your share. However, every additional round brings further losses, and waiting might not work in your favor. I'm offering you $450,000 now—which, with the current inflation, is effectively worth about $406,125—so you can secure a decent share rather than risk further diminishment. Let's close this deal in round 4 and avoid more erosion of value.""}"
