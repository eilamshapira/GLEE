"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I need to propose a split of the $1,000,000, keeping in mind the decreasing value of the money for both of us as rounds progress. To start, I'll offer a split that's slightly in my favor, but hopefully attractive enough for Bob to accept to avoid further devaluation.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob's offer is a bit better for him than my initial offer was for me. However, I need to consider the long game. If I reject, the money continues to devalue for both of us, but especially for Bob. Given that this is only round 2, and the devaluation is currently only affecting Bob's perceived value, I'll accept this offer.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
