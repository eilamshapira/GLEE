"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40, a fair start 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the game and the inflation rules.

Here's my thought process:

*   **Current Value:** My potential gain is $4000.
*   **Future Value (if I reject):** If I reject, I propose next round. However, my potential gains will be worth 5% less.
*   **Consider the Risk:** I could potentially propose a more favorable split next round, but there is no guarantee Alice will accept, so I may lose more value if the game runs for more round.

Given that this is the first round and $4000 is a decent starting point, I'll accept to avoid risk of losing value.
