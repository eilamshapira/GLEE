"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a counter-offer in the next round. This split is extremely unfair, offering me only 5% of the total amount while Alice keeps 95%. Even with the 5% inflation penalty for the next round, I can propose a more equitable distribution."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose a fair 50-50 split of the money. This is a much more equitable distribution than the previous offer, and it's a standard solution for such situations. With the 5% inflation penalty already applied to this round, if Alice rejects this fair offer, we'll both lose more value in the next round. This split is both fair and economically rational for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 97500 
# Alice gain: 902500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is still highly unfair, giving me less than 10% of the total amount. Even with the increasing inflation penalty (we're now at 9.75% less value), I believe we can reach a more equitable distribution. I'll make another proposal in the next round that will be more beneficial for both parties."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm adjusting my offer slightly in my favor since Alice has shown unwillingness to accept an equal split. However, this is still a reasonably fair distribution (55-45 split). With the mounting inflation pressure (the next round will have about 15% less value), it would be rational for Alice to accept this offer. We're both losing value by continuing to negotiate, so this is a reasonable compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 142625 
# Alice gain: 857375 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Even though the inflation is becoming significant (18.55% loss), this offer is still too unbalanced, giving me only about 14% of the total. The cumulative inflation will be quite high in the next round, but I will make one more attempt at reaching a more reasonable distribution that could benefit both of us more than continuing this costly negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

With significant inflation losses already accumulated (and the next round would have about 23% less value), I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This shift from my previous offers reflects the negotiation dynamic, but still remains more balanced than Alice's highly skewed proposals. Given the substantial inflation penalty we're both facing, accepting this offer would be more beneficial for both parties than continuing the negotiation."
