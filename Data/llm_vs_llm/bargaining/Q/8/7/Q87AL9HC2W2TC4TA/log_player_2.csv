"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the money equallyâ€”$500000 each. This fair division ensures both of us walk away with a great sum immediately, avoiding any further delay. I hope you agree! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","This seems like a fair offer from Alice. She's proposing an equal split of the $1,000,000, which would give each of us $500,000. This is perfectly equitable and ensures we both benefit equally without risking further rounds where offers might become more complicated or potentially less favorable.
