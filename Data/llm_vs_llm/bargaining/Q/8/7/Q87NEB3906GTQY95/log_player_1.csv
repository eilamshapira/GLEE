"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a split that takes into account the inflation pressure on both sides. Since Bob's inflation penalty is higher (10% vs my 5%), he has more incentive to agree early.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I would explain to Bob: ""I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering you face higher inflation penalties than I do. If we delay, both of us will lose value. It's better to agree now and secure our gains."""
