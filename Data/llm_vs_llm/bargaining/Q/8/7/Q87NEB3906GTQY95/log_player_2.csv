"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing that I get $400,000 and she gets $600,000. 

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but I'll value the money 10% less then (while Alice's discount is only 5%). This asymmetric inflation means delays hurt me more than Alice.

Given the significant devaluation I face with each round and the decent initial offer (40% of the total), I'll accept this proposal.
