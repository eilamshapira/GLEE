"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a slightly favorable split for myself since Bob might counter-offer and inflation will reduce future value.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose I get $60 and Bob gets $40. This is a reasonable starting offer that leaves room for negotiation while giving me a good outcome if accepted."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept, I'll get $45, but with 5% inflation, it's actually worth $42.75 to me
- If I reject, we go to another round where I can make an offer, but I'll face 10% total inflation
- My next offer would need to be significantly higher to compensate for the inflation
- There's no guarantee Bob would accept my next offer
- $42.75 is still a significant portion, and the risk of further devaluation makes this offer reasonable
