"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to make an offer that Bob is likely to accept. Given the 10% inflation per round for me, there's an incentive to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. However, I don't know how inflation affects Bob.

Let me propose a fair split with a slight advantage to me.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest a 55-45 split in my favor. This gives you a good portion while still being fair enough that you should consider accepting rather than moving to the next round where the total value decreases for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
