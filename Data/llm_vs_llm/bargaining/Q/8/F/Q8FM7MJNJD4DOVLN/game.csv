5500.0,4500.0,"Hi Bob, I'm offering a slight advantage to me since my inflation rate is higher (20% vs your 5%). This is still quite fair as we both get close to half, and if we delay, we both lose value.",Alice,1,

5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your point about the different inflation rates, but I think a 50-50 split is the fairest starting point. We both face inflation, though at different rates. If we go to round 3, your $5000 would be worth $4000 to you (after 20% inflation), while my $5000 would be worth $4750 to me (after 5% inflation). So you have more incentive to accept this fair split now rather than continuing to negotiate and losing more value.",Bob,2,
