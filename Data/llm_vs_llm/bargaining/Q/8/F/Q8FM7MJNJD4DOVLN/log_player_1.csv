"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I want to make a fair offer that takes into account our different inflation rates while being reasonable.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a slight advantage to me since my inflation rate is higher (20% vs your 5%). This is still quite fair as we both get close to half, and if we delay, we both lose value.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your point about the different inflation rates, but I think a 50-50 split is the fairest starting point. We both face inflation, though at different rates. If we go to round 3, your $5000 would be worth $4000 to you (after 20% inflation), while my $5000 would be worth $4750 to me (after 5% inflation). So you have more incentive to accept this fair split now rather than continuing to negotiate and losing more value. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Bob's offer given our different inflation rates.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 3, the money will be worth 20% less to me. This means my bargaining position weakens more quickly than Bob's does. While his offer isn't optimal for me, further delays would erode my potential gain significantly more than his.

Given the asymmetric inflation penalties, accepting a fair 50-50 split now is better than risking further devaluation of my share.
