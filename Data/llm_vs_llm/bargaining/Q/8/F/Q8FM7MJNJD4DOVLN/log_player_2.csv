"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering a slight advantage to me since my inflation rate is higher (20% vs your 5%). This is still quite fair as we both get close to half, and if we delay, we both lose value. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think through this offer. 

Alice is offering a split where she gets $5,500 and I get $4,500. Her reasoning is that her inflation rate is higher (20% vs my 5%), so she should get more money now.

If I reject and we go to the next round, I'd make a counter-offer. However, the money would be worth 5% less to me and 20% less to Alice. That means my $4,500 would effectively become $4,275 (5% less), and Alice's $5,500 would become $4,400 (20% less).

Given these inflation rates, Alice has a stronger incentive to settle now than I do. If we go another round, I could potentially negotiate a better deal for myself since Alice is losing value faster.

However, I need to consider that if my counter-offer is rejected, we'd go to round 3 where I'd lose even more value. The question is whether the potential gain from negotiation outweighs the guaranteed loss from inflation.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that accounts for our different inflation rates while being more balanced.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your point about the different inflation rates, but I think a 50-50 split is the fairest starting point. We both face inflation, though at different rates. If we go to round 3, your $5,000 would be worth $4,000 to you (after 20% inflation), while my $5,000 would be worth $4,750 to me (after 5% inflation). So you have more incentive to accept this fair split now rather than continuing to negotiate and losing more value.""}"
