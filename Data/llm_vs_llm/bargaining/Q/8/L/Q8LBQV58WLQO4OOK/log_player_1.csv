"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money is decreasing, so I need to secure a larger portion for myself in this round. 
* **Bob's perspective:** Bob's offer in Round 2 suggests he might be willing to accept a slightly smaller share than initially proposed. However, it's unclear how inflation is impacting his valuation.
* **Compromise:** This offer is a compromise between my initial ask and Bob's offer, aiming for a resolution before inflation further erodes the value."
