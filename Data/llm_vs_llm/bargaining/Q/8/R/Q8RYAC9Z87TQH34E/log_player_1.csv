"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000} 
```

Reasoning: 

I'm trying to entice Bob with a slightly better deal than last round, while still accounting for the inflation that's affecting my potential gains. It's a balancing act between getting a good deal and ensuring we reach an agreement before the money dwindles."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 460000 
# Bob gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Reasoning: While the offer is closer to an even split, the inflation is working heavily against me. Accepting this offer would give me less than half of the initial value, and I believe I can still negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 510000, ""bob_gain"": 490000} 
```

Reasoning: 

I'm sticking close to a 50/50 split now. The inflation is becoming more significant, and it's important to secure a deal soon.  I'm hoping Bob will see the fairness of this offer given the circumstances."
