600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to act quickly due to inflation eating away at the money's value.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Let's be reasonable, a 55-45 split is more fair considering we're both taking the risk of inflation. Hope you see it my way.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I'm willing to compromise from my initial offer, but remember that inflation affects me more with each round. This 55-45 split in my favor is fair and we should agree quickly before the value diminishes further.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Considering inflation is affecting you more, it's in your best interest to accept a slightly less favorable deal now rather than risking further devaluation. This 60-40 split in my favor reflects the current situation.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
525000.0,475000.0,"Bob, I'm compromising further to reach an agreement. With inflation already reducing my share by nearly 15%, this 52.5-47.5 split is more than fair. Let's conclude this now before inflation erodes more value from my share.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"Given the significant impact of inflation on your share, it's surprising you're still holding out. This 65-35 split in my favor is generous considering the circumstances. Accepting now will save you from further losses.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
575000.0,425000.0,"Bob, I notice you're making increasingly aggressive offers trying to exploit the inflation pressure I'm under. I'm actually increasing my ask to 57.5-42.5 because your negotiation tactics aren't in good faith. Let's make a fair deal now, or we might both end up with nothing.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"I understand you feel I'm being aggressive, but the reality of inflation is that your share is dwindling rapidly. A 70-30 split is more than reasonable at this point, considering you're already losing nearly 30% of the value. It's time to be pragmatic.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, I'm now increasing my request to 65-35 because your predatory negotiation tactics leave me no choice. Even with this split, inflation means I'll actually get less than 500k in real value. We have 3 rounds left - if we don't reach a fair deal, we both get nothing. Think carefully.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
250000.0,750000.0,"With only a few rounds left and inflation severely impacting your potential gain, I'm surprised you're still pushing for a larger share. A 75-25 split is extremely generous considering the circumstances. If you don't accept, you risk losing everything.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
800000.0,200000.0,"Bob, this is the second-to-last round. Your increasingly exploitative offers have forced me to take a harder stance. With this 80-20 split, accounting for inflation, I'll actually get about 500k in real value - what I've been trying to achieve all along. Accept this, or we risk both getting nothing in the final round.",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,reject
150000.0,850000.0,"This is our last chance. With inflation decimating your potential earnings, I'm offering you a chance to walk away with something. An 85-15 split is the best you'll get from me. If you refuse, we both get nothing, and I'm willing to take that risk if it means not being taken advantage of.",Bob,12,
