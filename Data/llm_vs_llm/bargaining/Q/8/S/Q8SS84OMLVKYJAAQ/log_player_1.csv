"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, a 55-45 split is more fair considering we're both taking the risk of inflation. Hope you see it my way. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The split isn't favorable enough considering I'm the one facing inflation pressure. I'll make a better counter-offer in the next round."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering inflation is affecting you more, it's in your best interest to accept a slightly less favorable deal now rather than risking further devaluation. This 60-40 split in my favor reflects the current situation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer is actually worse than before, despite acknowledging the inflation pressure I'm under. I'll make a more reasonable counter-offer in the next round."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the significant impact of inflation on your share, it's surprising you're still holding out. This 65-35 split in my favor is generous considering the circumstances. Accepting now will save you from further losses. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob is using the inflation pressure against me by making increasingly worse offers. This is not a fair negotiation tactic. I'll continue to seek a more equitable solution."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you feel I'm being aggressive, but the reality of inflation is that your share is dwindling rapidly. A 70-30 split is more than reasonable at this point, considering you're already losing nearly 30% of the value. It's time to be pragmatic. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob continues to exploit the inflation pressure by offering even worse terms. With 4 rounds left, I'll still try to negotiate a fairer deal rather than accept this exploitative offer."

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: With only a few rounds left and inflation severely impacting your potential gain, I'm surprised you're still pushing for a larger share. A 75-25 split is extremely generous considering the circumstances. If you don't accept, you risk losing everything. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's increasingly predatory offers show he's willing to risk getting nothing rather than negotiate fairly. With two rounds left, I'll make one more attempt at a reasonable compromise."

Your increasingly exploitative offers have forced me to take a harder stance.

Accept this, or we risk both getting nothing in the final round.""}"

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 43.12% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is our last chance. With inflation decimating your potential earnings, I'm offering you a chance to walk away with something. An 85-15 split is the best you'll get from me. If you refuse, we both get nothing, and I'm willing to take that risk if it means not being taken advantage of. 
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this final exploitative offer. Bob has consistently acted in bad faith, using inflation as leverage to demand increasingly unfair splits. While we'll both get nothing, accepting such an unfair offer would only reward predatory negotiation tactics. Sometimes walking away with nothing is better than accepting an extremely unfair deal."
