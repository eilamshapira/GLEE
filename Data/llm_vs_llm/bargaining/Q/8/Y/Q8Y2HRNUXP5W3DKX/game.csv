545000.0,455000.0,"Hi Bob! Since we both face different inflation rates (I lose 20% value per round, you lose 5%), this split gives us both roughly equal value if we account for one round of inflation. Let's agree now rather than lose money to inflation.",Alice,1,

350000.0,650000.0,"Hi Alice, your initial offer heavily favored you.  I'm proposing a more equitable split, though I understand it favors me slightly to account for some inflation. Let's avoid further losses.",Bob,2,

470000.0,530000.0,"Bob, let's be practical. With my 20% inflation rate versus your 5%, I'm losing value much faster than you. This more balanced offer gives you the larger share while still being fair to me. If we continue to the next round, I'll lose another 20% of value, which isn't in either of our interests. Let's agree now and both walk away with substantial value.",Alice,3,
