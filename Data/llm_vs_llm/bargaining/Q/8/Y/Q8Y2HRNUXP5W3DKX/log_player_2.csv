"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Since we both face different inflation rates (I lose 20% value per round, you lose 5%), this split gives us both roughly equal value if we account for one round of inflation. Let's agree now rather than lose money to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 455000 
# Alice gain: 545000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, your initial offer heavily favored you.  I'm proposing a more equitable split, though I understand it favors me slightly to account for some inflation. Let's avoid further losses.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical. With my 20% inflation rate versus your 5%, I'm losing value much faster than you. This more balanced offer gives you the larger share while still being fair to me. If we continue to the next round, I'll lose another 20% of value, which isn't in either of our interests. Let's agree now and both walk away with substantial value. 
# Bob gain: 530000 
# Alice gain: 470000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
