"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make my first offer as Alice in this game. I need to consider the fact that with each passing round, the money becomes 20% less valuable to me, so there's an incentive to reach an agreement sooner rather than later.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose that I receive $60 and Bob receives $40. This gives me a decent share while still being fair enough to Bob that he might accept rather than moving to the next round where we'd both lose value due to inflation."
