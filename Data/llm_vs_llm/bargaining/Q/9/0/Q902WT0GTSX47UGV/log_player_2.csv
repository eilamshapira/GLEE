"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: I get $40, Alice gets $60
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 10% inflation, any amount in the next round will be worth 10% less to me
4. If I reject, $40 in the next round would only be worth $36 to me
5. To come out ahead in the next round, I'd need to secure significantly more than $44.44 ($40 รท 0.9) to offset inflation

While the split isn't exactly fair (40/60), getting $40 now is better than risking a negotiation where inflation will reduce my purchasing power. If Alice rejects my counter-offer, we'd go to round 3 with even more inflation impact.
