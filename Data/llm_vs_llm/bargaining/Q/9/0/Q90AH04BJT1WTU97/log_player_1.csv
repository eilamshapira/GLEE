"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a reasonable first offer, considering that inflation will affect future rounds and we need to reach an agreement within 12 rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which gives me a good portion while still being fair enough that Bob might accept it. If Bob rejects, my next gain will be worth 20% less, so I'm motivated to make a reasonable first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
* If I accept, I'll get $450,000 Ã— 0.8 = $360,000 in effective value (due to 20% inflation)
* If I reject, the next round will have another 20% inflation for me
* Bob's offer is reasonable, giving me 45% of the total
* Further negotiations might lead to worse outcomes due to increasing inflation
* We have 10 rounds left, but each round reduces my effective gains

Given these factors, I'll accept this offer. While I might negotiate for more, the inflation risk is too high, and this is a reasonable split.
