"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

My reasoning is that this offers me a slight advantage, recognizing I'm the one making the first offer. Hopefully, Bob will find this acceptable to avoid inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this.

Bob is offering me $5200, but it's worth 5% less than it would have been in the first round. This means the actual value to me is $5200 * 0.95 = $4940.

He gets $4800, which is the same value as before.

Since the difference between what he gets and what I get is pretty small now, and I'm already facing inflation, I will accept this offer.
