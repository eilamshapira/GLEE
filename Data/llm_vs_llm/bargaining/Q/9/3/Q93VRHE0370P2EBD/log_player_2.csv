"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000 (40%)
2. This is the first round, so no inflation has occurred yet
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
4. However, there's no guarantee Alice will accept my counter-offer
5. $4,000 is a substantial amount, though less than half

While I could try to negotiate for a more equal split, there's a risk Alice might reject my counter-offer. The amount offered is significant enough to consider accepting.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer since I believe we can reach a more equitable distribution, and I know inflation won't affect my portion in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more equitable split, but still giving Alice a slightly larger share to increase the chances of acceptance:

{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200}

This offer is more balanced than the previous one, moving from a 40-60 split to a 48-52 split. It's fair enough that Alice should seriously consider accepting it, while still giving her a small advantage. I'm maintaining reasonable terms while accounting for the fact that she might counter-offer if she rejects."
