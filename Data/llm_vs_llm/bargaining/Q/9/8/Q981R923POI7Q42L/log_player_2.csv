Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increased inflation impact on you, this is a fair compromise 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This offer is barely better than my last one after accounting for inflation. Accepting now avoids further losses for both of us."
