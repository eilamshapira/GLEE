"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I take 60% and you take 40%. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's proposal carefully.

Alice is suggesting a 60-40 split in her favor, which would give me $400,000 and her $600,000. While I appreciate her opening offer, I think we can work toward a more equitable division.

Since this is just the first round and we have 11 more potential rounds, I'll make a counter-proposal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I believe a 50-50 split would be the most fair approach for both of us. This way we each receive half a million dollars, which is a substantial amount. What do you think?""}"
