"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer of $40 for me and $60 for her, or reject it and make a counter-offer in the next round.

If I reject, the total money will be worth 10% less (so $90 total in the next round). I would need to propose a split that Alice would find acceptable, while trying to get more than $40 for myself.

Let me think: If I reject and the pot becomes $90, even if I proposed a 50/50 split in the next round, I would get $45, which is better than the current $40 offer. However, Alice might reject my offer, leading to further depreciation.

Given that I can make a counter-offer in the next round that could be better for me while still being acceptable to Alice, I'll reject this first offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a more balanced split that should be attractive to Alice while improving my position.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing an equal 50-50 split of the remaining $90. This gives us each $45, which is still better for me than the original offer, and it's fair to Alice as well. Since we're now in round 2, we're dividing $90 total due to the 10% inflation, but I'm expressing this as percentages of the original $100 for clarity."
