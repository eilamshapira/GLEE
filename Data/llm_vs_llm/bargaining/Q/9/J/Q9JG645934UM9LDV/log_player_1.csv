"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to propose a split of $1,000,000 to Bob. My goal is to maximize my gain while considering the decreasing value of the money for me and the need to reach an agreement within 12 rounds.

Here's my offer for Round 1, formatted in JSON:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

Explanation:

*   I'm asking for a larger share (60%) because I anticipate Bob might try to squeeze me later, and the money's value decreases for me.
*   Giving Bob 40% is still a substantial amount, which I hope will entice him to accept the offer and avoid further rounds with inflation for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I see Bob is playing hardball. Let's analyze this offer.

*   **Bob's Offer:** $450,000 for me, $550,000 for him.
*   **Inflation:** My share is now worth 5% less than it would have been in Round 1. That means $450,000 in Round 2 is worth $450,000 / 1.05 = approximately $428,571 in Round 1 dollars.

Compared to what I wanted initially ($600,000), this is a significant decrease. However, rejecting this offer means further inflation in the next round. Let's think strategically. I believe Bob will continue to offer me smaller portions. I should accept this and avoid losing more in the coming rounds.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
