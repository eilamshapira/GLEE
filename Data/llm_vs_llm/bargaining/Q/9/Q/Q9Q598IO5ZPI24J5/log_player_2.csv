"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and end this quickly 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is suggesting a split where she gets a bit more than me ($55 vs $45). While an even 50-50 split might seem more fair, accepting this now means I get $45 immediately rather than risking losing 5% of the total value in the next round. If I reject and propose a 50-50 split next round, we'd only be dividing $95 total, and my share would be $47.50 - only $2.50 more than accepting now.

Considering the time value of money and the risk of further losses from inflation with each round, this is a reasonable offer.
