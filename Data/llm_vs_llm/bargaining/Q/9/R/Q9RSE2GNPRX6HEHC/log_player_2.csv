"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if this offer is fair given my situation with inflation. If I reject, I'll get to make an offer next round, but the total value will be 20% less for me. 

Let's analyze: If I reject, the $10,000 becomes worth $8,000 to me in the next round. If I then proposed a 50-50 split ($5,000 each), that would be equivalent to me getting $4,000 of today's value.

Alice's current offer gives me $4,000 right now, which is the same effective value I'd get if I made a fair offer next round after inflation. Given the uncertainty about how inflation affects Alice and the risk of further rounds reducing value, it makes sense to accept this offer.
