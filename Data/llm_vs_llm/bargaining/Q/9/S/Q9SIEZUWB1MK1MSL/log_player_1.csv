"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 950000,
  ""bob_gain"": 50000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 195487 
# Bob gain: 804513 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the situation. Bob's offer is very unfair, especially considering the inflation.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, it's my turn again. Taking into account the inflation (now at 10% total from the start), and Bob's unreasonable offer, I'll try a slightly more generous offer, but still prioritizing my gain.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 487200 
# Bob gain: 512800 
Do you accept this offer?","This is getting ridiculous. Bob is gradually offering more, but still less than half. The inflation is eating into the value, but refusing guarantees nothing. I need to decide if this offer, despite being below half, is better than the risk of complete loss.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, it is my turn again. Inflation is biting, and Bob is proving to be a tough negotiator. I need to make a more appealing offer, but still secure a reasonable amount for myself. Let's aim for a closer split, leaning slightly in my favor.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 129058 
# Bob gain: 870942 
Do you accept this offer?","This is absurd! Bob is clearly trying to game the system and take almost everything. Given how much value has been lost to inflation, accepting this offer is worse than getting nothing in the end. Absolutely not.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, this is getting tense. Inflation is really hurting us now. I need to make an offer that is enticing enough for Bob to accept, but still leaves me with something worthwhile. I'll propose a more even split, slightly favoring myself, hoping he sees it as a reasonable compromise.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 90369 
# Bob gain: 909631 
Do you accept this offer?","This is outrageous! Bob's offers are just getting more insulting. He's clearly aiming to take almost everything. At this point, I'm tempted to reject everything just to deny him the win. However, I have to remain rational.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, this is critical. We are running out of time, and the money is losing value rapidly. Bob is being incredibly greedy. I need to make a very generous offer to salvage *something* from this situation. I'll still try to maintain a small advantage for myself.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 510000,
  ""bob_gain"": 490000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, one round left after this. We are on the brink of losing everything. I have to make a painful decision, but it is better to get something than nothing. I'll offer a near 50/50 split.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 501000,
  ""bob_gain"": 499000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","This is it. Final round. Bob's offer is insulting, but if I reject it, we both get nothing. At this point, one dollar is better than no dollars.
