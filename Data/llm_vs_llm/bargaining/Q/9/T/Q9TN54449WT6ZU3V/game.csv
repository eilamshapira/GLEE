3000.0,7000.0,"Hi Bob, for round 1 I propose we split the funds so that you receive $7000 and I receive $3000. Keep in mind that if we delay the deal, my share will lose 10% of its value each roundâ€”so agreeing now preserves more value for both of us. Looking forward to your acceptance!",Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, I understand your concern about devaluation. However, I believe a more balanced split would be fairer. I propose I get $5500 and you get $4500. This way, we both get a good share, and there's still room for negotiation in future rounds if needed.",Bob,2,
