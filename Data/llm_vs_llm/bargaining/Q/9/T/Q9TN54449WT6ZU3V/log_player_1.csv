"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 3000, ""bob_gain"": 7000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, for round 1 I propose we split the funds so that you receive $7,000 and I receive $3,000. Keep in mind that if we delay the deal, my share will lose 10% of its value each roundâ€”so agreeing now preserves more value for both of us. Looking forward to your acceptance!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about devaluation. However, I believe a more balanced split would be fairer. I propose I get $5500 and you get $4500. This way, we both get a good share, and there's still room for negotiation in future rounds if needed. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
