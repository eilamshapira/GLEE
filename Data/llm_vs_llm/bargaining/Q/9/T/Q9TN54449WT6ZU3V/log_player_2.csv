"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, for round 1 I propose we split the funds so that you receive $7000 and I receive $3000. Keep in mind that if we delay the deal, my share will lose 10% of its value each roundâ€”so agreeing now preserves more value for both of us. Looking forward to your acceptance! 
# Bob gain: 7000 
# Alice gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concern about devaluation. However, I believe a more balanced split would be fairer. I propose I get $5500 and you get $4500. This way, we both get a good share, and there's still room for negotiation in future rounds if needed.""}"
