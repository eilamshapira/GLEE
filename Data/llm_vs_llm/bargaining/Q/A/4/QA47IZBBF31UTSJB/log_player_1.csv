Let's start with a reasonable offer. ðŸ˜‰"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is getting better for him, but it's getting worse for me much faster. I'll hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,

Since the value depreciates faster for me, I need to push for a larger share. Let's see if Bob accepts this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}

Although not ideal, the effects of inflation are becoming too significant for me. Accepting this offer is better than risking a worse outcome in the next round."
