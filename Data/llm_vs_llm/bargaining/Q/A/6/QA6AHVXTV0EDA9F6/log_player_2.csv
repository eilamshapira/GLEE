"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This offer gives us both a good starting point, Bob. Let's not lose money to inflation! 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the rules. Let's analyze Alice's offer.

*   **My gain:** $350,000
*   **Alice's gain:** $650,000

Considering the inflation, if I reject, the money will be worth 20% less for me in the next round, so $350,000 * 0.8 = $280,000 (equivalent value).
If Alice rejects, the money will be worth 10% less for Alice in the next round, so $650,000 * 0.9 = $585,000 (equivalent value).

I think that $350,000 is a bit low considering Alice would still get $650,000. I am going to reject.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Okay, it's my turn to propose a division. Knowing that Alice also suffers from inflation, but less severely than I do, I need to make an offer that is attractive to her while still getting a reasonable amount for myself.

```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. Inflation is hurting us both, but this split acknowledges it more for me. This is my best offer.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is still the best way to avoid significant losses. This is a fair deal considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze Alice's new offer, taking inflation into account.

*   **Nominal values:**
    *   Bob: $400,000
    *   Alice: $600,000
*   **Inflation adjusted value (compared to round 1):**
    *   My money is worth 36% less than in round 1, meaning I'm only getting 64% of its initial value.
    *   $400,000 * 0.64 = $256,000 (equivalent to this in round 1)
    *   Alice's money is worth 19% less than in round 1, meaning she's getting 81% of its initial value.
    *   $600,000 * 0.81 = $486,000 (equivalent to this in round 1)

The total equivalent value in round 1 is 256000 + 486000 = 742000.
If I reject, next round the money will be worth 20% less for me so: 256000*0.8 = 204800 (equivalent to this in round 1).
If Alice rejects, next round the money will be worth 10% less for her so: 486000*0.9 = 437400 (equivalent to this in round 1).

I still think I can get a better deal.

```json

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Alright, it's my turn again. We are losing value quickly. I'll increase my offer slightly, hoping Alice will take it.

```json
{
""bob_gain"": 575000,
""alice_gain"": 425000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is it. We're both losing money fast. This is as good as it will get. Take it.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer to a deal. This offer accounts for the inflation hitting you harder and still gives us both a good chunk of the money. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, time to analyze again.

*   **Nominal values:**
    *   Bob: $420,000
    *   Alice: $580,000
*   **Inflation adjusted value (compared to round 1):**
    *   My money is worth 59.04% less than in round 1, meaning I'm only getting 40.96% of its initial value.
    *   $420,000 * 0.4096 = $172,032 (equivalent to this in round 1)
    *   Alice's money is worth 34.39% less than in round 1, meaning she's getting 65.61% of its initial value.
    *   $580,000 * 0.6561 = $380,538 (equivalent to this in round 1)

The total equivalent value in round 1 is 172032 + 380538 = 552570
If I reject, next round the money will be worth 20% less for me so: 172032*0.8 = 137625.6 (equivalent to this in round 1).
If Alice rejects, next round the money will be worth 10% less for her so: 380538*0.9 = 342484.2 (equivalent to this in round 1).

I can't keep losing so much value. This is a low deal, but better than nothing.
