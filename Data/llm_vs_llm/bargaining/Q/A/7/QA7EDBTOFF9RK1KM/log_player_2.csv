"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is an uneven split where Alice gets $6000 (60%) and I get $4000 (40%). While Alice calls it a ""fair 60-40 split"", a truly fair split would be 50-50. I think we can reach a more equitable arrangement.
