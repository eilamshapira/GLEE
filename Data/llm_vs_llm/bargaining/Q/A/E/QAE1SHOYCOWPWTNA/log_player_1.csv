"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Based on the “alternating‐offers” bargaining theory (with a twist: only Bob’s money depreciates from round to round), you—as the patient party (no discounting for you) versus Bob’s 10% per round discount factor—can force nearly all of the dollar value. In an infinite‐horizon Rubinstein “ultimatum” type game, the equilibrium division has the fully patient party claiming essentially 100% of the pie while offering the other just what he would get after a delay (which turns out to be nothing in the limit). (In practice one might offer an arbitrarily small positive amount to induce acceptance.) 

Thus, for Round 1, one acceptable equilibrium offer in our game is:

{""alice_gain"": 1000000, ""bob_gain"": 0}

Let’s proceed with that as my proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.
