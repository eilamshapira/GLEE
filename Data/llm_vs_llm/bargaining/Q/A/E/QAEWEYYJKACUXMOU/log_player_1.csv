"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I'll try to make a reasonable offer, keeping in mind the inflation risk.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

My proposal is: Alice gets $6000 and Bob gets $4000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I see Bob's offer. Let's analyze this.

My initial proposal was for $6000. Now Bob is offering me $4500. However, due to inflation, my $4500 is worth 5% less than it would have been in Round 1. Therefore the value of the $4500 is 4500 * 0.95 = $4275.

I am going to reject the offer.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I need to make a new offer considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer. I will try to be more conciliatory, but still aim for a good outcome for myself. Remember my money's value is 10% less now.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

My proposal is: Alice gets $5500 and Bob gets $4500. This is only 500 less than I asked for in round 1, and hopefully Bob will accept it to avoid further losses."
