"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000 of the $10,000. Given that there's 20% inflation for me each round, if I reject and we go to the next round, the total value to me will decrease. Let me think about whether I should accept or propose a counter-offer.

If I reject, I can make my own proposal next round, but the total will be worth 20% less to me, so the $10,000 would effectively be worth $8,000 to me. I need to decide if I can get more than $4,000 by continuing.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that accounts for the inflation I face. Since I've already lost 20% of the value, I should propose a division that gives me more than the inflation-adjusted equivalent of Alice's first offer.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering a more balanced split that gives me a bit more than half, considering I'm facing inflation with each round. This is fair because we both need to reach an agreement, and the total pot is decreasing in value for me with each passing round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this new offer carefully. Alice is now offering me $4,500 while taking $5,500. 

Due to inflation, the money is now worth 36% less to me than in round 1. So $4,500 now is equivalent to $4,500 Ã— (1 - 0.36) = $2,880 in round 1 value for me.

If I reject and we go to round 4, I'll face even more inflation. I notice Alice is facing much less inflation (only 9.75% so far) than I am (36%), which explains why she's negotiating more aggressively.

Since Alice improved her offer from $4,000 to $4,500 for me, and considering my significant inflation penalty, I'll accept this offer before my potential gains decrease further.
