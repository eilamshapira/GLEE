"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $40 while keeping $60 for herself
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 20% inflation, if I wait until next round, my money will be worth less
4. $40 now is better than potentially getting more later but with 20% less value
5. For example, even if I got $50 next round, it would only be worth $40 due to inflation
