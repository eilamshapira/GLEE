"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think through this situation. Alice's offer is $475,000 for me and $525,000 for herself. This is slightly in her favor.

If I reject, I get to make an offer in the next round, but there's a 5% inflation penalty, meaning the total value would be $950,000 instead of $1,000,000. That means even if I proposed a perfect 50-50 split in the next round, we'd each get $475,000 - which is exactly what I'm being offered now.

Since I wouldn't gain any advantage by rejecting (and might risk Alice rejecting my next offer), I should accept this offer.
