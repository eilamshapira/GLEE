"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to agree quickly due to inflation affecting our gains. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering a 60-40 split in her favor, which means I would get $4,000 and she would get $6,000. Since this is just the first round and inflation only reduces the value by 10% per round, I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe a 50-50 split is most fair to both of us. This way we each get $5,000, which is better for me and still good for you. If we keep negotiating, inflation will reduce our total value, so a fair split now benefits us both.""}"
