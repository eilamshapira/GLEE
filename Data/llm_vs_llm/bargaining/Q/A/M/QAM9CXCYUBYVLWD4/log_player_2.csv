"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I'd like to propose a more balanced division of the money. I'll take $60, and you'll get $40. This is a much fairer split than what you proposed, and it recognizes that we both deserve a substantial portion of the money. Given that inflation will reduce the value by 20% each round for me, it makes sense to reach an agreement sooner rather than later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
