"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I'll start with an offer. Considering the first round and the initial value, my offer is:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the offer from Bob:

*   **My perspective (Alice):** The $500,000 I'd receive is worth 5% less than in round 1.
*   **Bob's perspective:** The $500,000 Bob would receive is worth 10% less than in round 1.

In this case, I will reject this offer.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for round 3.  Remembering that the value of the money has depreciated for both of us. I'll aim for a slightly better outcome for myself, given the decreasing value of the money.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 620000,
  ""bob_gain"": 380000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the offer from Bob:

*   **My perspective (Alice):** The $450,000 I'd receive is worth 14.26% less than in round 1.
*   **Bob's perspective:** The $550,000 Bob would receive is worth 27.1% less than in round 1.

Given the decreasing value, I need to make a decision that considers the long-term implications. Even though the split isn't ideal for me, the situation has changed due to inflation. I will accept this offer.

```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
