"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair initial offer, considering that time pressure affects me more than Bob (20% vs 10% inflation per round). I want to establish a cooperative tone while securing a reasonable share.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose $55 for me and $45 for Bob - a slightly favorable split for me as the first mover, but still fair enough to be acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob's offer gives me $60, but due to 20% inflation, it's actually worth $48 (60 * 0.8)
2. Bob would get $40, worth $36 to him after 10% inflation
3. If I reject, we move to round 3 with even more inflation
4. This offer is actually better for me than my initial proposal would have been after inflation

Given that inflation hits me harder than Bob (20% vs 10%), and this is actually a favorable split, I should accept now rather than risk further devaluation.
