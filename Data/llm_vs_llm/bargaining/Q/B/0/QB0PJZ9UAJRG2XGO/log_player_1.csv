"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer that takes into account the inflation rates for both of us. Since Bob's inflation rate is higher (20% vs my 5%), he has more incentive to settle early than I do.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which gives Bob a substantial portion while acknowledging that I have a stronger position in future rounds due to the inflation difference."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I notice Bob is trying to get a larger share despite having a higher inflation rate. Let me make a more strategic offer that accounts for the current inflation situation.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split. This is more generous to Bob than my first offer and recognizes that we've now had two rounds of inflation. With Bob's 20% inflation per round, his money is now worth significantly less, so it's in his interest to accept a reasonable offer now rather than continue negotiating."
