"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.

I'd like to propose a slight adjustment that gives me a bit more, considering the inflation will affect me more severely in future rounds. A 55-45 split seems fair while still giving Alice a substantial amount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48}

I see we're having trouble reaching an agreement, and the inflation is affecting us both. Let me propose a more balanced split that acknowledges both of our positions. Since inflation affects me more severely, I still need a bit more than half, but I'm willing to compromise from my previous offer."
