"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's settle this quickly to avoid the effects of inflation. This is a fair split considering the risk. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:

1. She's offering me $400,000 (40%) while keeping $600,000 (60%)
2. There's no inflation impact for me, so the money's value won't decrease
3. I have 11 more rounds if I reject, and I could counter with a better offer
4. However, Alice might be experiencing inflation effects, which could make her less willing to accept lower amounts in later rounds
5. $400,000 is still a significant amount, but I believe I can get a better deal

Since there's no inflation risk for me and the split isn't quite fair, I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while acknowledging our need to reach an agreement:

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""I propose a perfectly fair 50-50 split. This is the most equitable solution for both of us, and we can avoid any further negotiations.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but let's be quick. Inflation is eating into my share with each round. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze Alice's new offer:

1. She's now offering me $450,000 (45%) while keeping $550,000 (55%)
2. This is a $50,000 improvement from her first offer
3. I know inflation is affecting her share (9.75% less value for her), but not mine
4. Her message indicates she's feeling pressure from inflation
5. While this is better than the first offer, I still have 9 rounds left
6. Since inflation affects only her side, I might get an even better deal by waiting

Given that inflation is creating increasing pressure on Alice's side while my value remains stable, I'll reject this offer and wait for a better one.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that Alice is experiencing inflation and has shown willingness to move towards a more balanced split, I'll make a strategic offer that's better than her last one but still advantages me slightly:

{""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""I understand inflation is affecting your share. This offer gives you a substantial amount quickly, and it's better to settle now than let inflation reduce your value further.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm meeting you halfway, but we need to wrap this up. Inflation is becoming a serious issue for me. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze Alice's latest offer:

1. She's now offering me $480,000 (48%) while keeping $520,000 (52%)
2. This is another $30,000 improvement from her last offer
3. Inflation has significantly increased on her side (18.55% less value)
4. Her real value is actually only about $423,540 (520,000 * (1 - 0.1855))
5. She's showing clear signs of pressure from inflation
6. I still have 7 rounds left, and inflation will continue to affect her position
7. My value remains stable regardless of time

Given that inflation is creating substantial pressure on Alice's side (nearly 20% loss already) while my value remains stable, I believe I can get an even better deal by waiting. The trend shows she's consistently improving my share as inflation increases.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that Alice is now under significant inflation pressure (18.55% and growing) and has been steadily increasing my share, I'll push for a stronger position while still leaving her a reasonable amount:

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""With inflation significantly impacting your share, it's in your best interest to accept this offer now. Your real value is decreasing with each round, while this offer gives you a substantial $450,000 immediately. Further delays will only reduce your purchasing power.""}"
