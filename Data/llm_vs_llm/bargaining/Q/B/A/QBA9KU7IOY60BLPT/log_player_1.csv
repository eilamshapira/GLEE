"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let me propose a fair split, considering I'm playing as Alice and there's inflation risk.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable split that gives both of us a good portion, while slightly favoring me since I'm making the first offer. If Bob declines, the next round's $100 will be worth only $90 to me due to inflation, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this... 

Due to 10% inflation, if I accept this offer, $50 will actually be worth $45 to me, while Bob gets his full $50. While this is less than my initial proposal, rejecting would mean the next round's money would be worth even less to me (20% less than original value), and there's no guarantee Bob would accept a better offer.
