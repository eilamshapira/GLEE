"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think through this strategically:

1. Alice is offering a 50-50 split ($500,000 each)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. For Alice, the money will be worth 10% less next round
4. This means $500,000 next round would only be worth $450,000 to her
5. I can use this to negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round
6. Alice should rationally accept a lower amount next round rather than lose more value

Since I can likely get a better deal by rejecting and making a counter-offer that takes advantage of Alice's time pressure, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that the money is worth 10% less to Alice this round, I can offer her slightly less than $500,000 and it would still be rational for her to accept rather than risk losing another 10% in value next round.

If she gets $450,000 now, it's worth more to her than $500,000 in the next round (which would be worth only $450,000 to her due to the 10% depreciation).

I'll offer a split that gives me a bit more while still being attractive enough for Alice to accept:

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

This is a fair offer considering the time pressure on Alice's side, and it should be rational for her to accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice is offering me $550,000, which is actually the same split I just proposed
2. For Alice, the $450,000 is now worth only about $364,500 (due to 19% depreciation)
3. If I reject, and we go to the next round:
   - I can make another offer
   - But Alice's value will depreciate further (by 29%)
   - Alice might be willing to accept an even lower amount next round
4. However, there's risk in rejection:
   - Alice might not accept my next offer
   - This could lead to further rounds where we both lose value
   - We're already at a pretty favorable split for me (55-45)

Given that I'm already getting the better end of the deal ($550,000), and considering the risk of prolonging negotiations, I'll accept this offer.
