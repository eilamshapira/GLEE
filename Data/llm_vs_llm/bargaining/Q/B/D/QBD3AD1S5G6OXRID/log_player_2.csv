"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split it 60-40 in my favor. This ensures we both get a fair share while considering the inflation risk. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer gives me $40
2. If I reject and propose next round:
   * The money will be worth 20% less to me
   * $100 * 0.8 = $80 total value for me
   * Even if I propose a better split in my favor, the reduced value means I might not get much more

This initial offer of $40 is not great, but considering the inflation penalty, rejecting might lead to worse outcomes. If I reject and propose 70-30 in my favor next round, I'd get $70 but it would only be worth $56 to me due to inflation.
