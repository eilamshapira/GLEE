5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. Consider that if we keep negotiating, we both lose value due to inflation - you at 10% per round and me at 20%. This equal split maximizes our combined value. If we delay further, we're both worse off.",Bob,2,

6500.0,3500.0,"Okay, Bob, since you rejected my first offer, I'm making a slightly adjusted offer. Considering the impact of inflation on both of us, I propose 6500 for me and 3500 for you. This is still a beneficial deal for you given the diminishing value. Let me know what you think.",Alice,3,
