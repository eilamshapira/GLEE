"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. Consider that if we keep negotiating, we both lose value due to inflation - you at 10% per round and me at 20%. This equal split maximizes our combined value. If we delay further, we're both worse off. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
