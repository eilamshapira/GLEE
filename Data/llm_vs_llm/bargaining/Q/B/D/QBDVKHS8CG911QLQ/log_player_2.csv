"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split this fairly. I'm taking 7000, you get 3000. Deal? 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's offer considering the inflation factor.

If I reject, we go to the next round where I can make a counter-offer, but the money will be worth 20% less to me. So in round 2, the $10,000 would effectively be worth $8,000 to me.

Alice's current offer gives me $3,000. If I reject and move to round 2, I'd need to secure more than $3,750 ($3,000 รท 0.8) to make rejecting worthwhile.

Given that Alice would also face 10% inflation, I could potentially negotiate a better deal. But I need to weigh the risk that she might reject my counter-offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I need to make a strategic offer considering our different inflation rates.

Since Alice faces a 10% inflation rate per round, the money is now worth 90% of the original value to her. For me, it's worth 80% due to my higher inflation rate.

I'll propose a more balanced split that accounts for both our inflation rates and gives us both incentive to agree now rather than continue negotiations with further value erosion.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. Consider that if we keep negotiating, we both lose value due to inflation - you at 10% per round and me at 20%. This equal split maximizes our combined value. If we delay further, we're both worse off.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, since you rejected my first offer, I'm making a slightly adjusted offer. Considering the impact of inflation on both of us, I propose 6500 for me and 3500 for you. This is still a beneficial deal for you given the diminishing value. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer considering the increasing inflation.

At this point in round 3:
- For me, money is worth 36% less than the first round (64% of original value)
- For Alice, money is worth 19% less than the first round (81% of original value)

Alice is offering me $3,500, which after my inflation is equivalent to $3,500 ร 0.64 = $2,240 in original value.

If I reject and we move to round 4, I'd face an even steeper inflation rate, making the remaining money worth even less to me. Additionally, even if I make a counter-offer in round 4, Alice might reject it, leading to further rounds and more value loss.

Given the accelerating inflation rates that disadvantage me more than Alice, and the improved offer from her original proposal, accepting now is the rational choice.
