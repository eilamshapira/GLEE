60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob! I propose a 60/40 split which is slightly in my favor. As we go more rounds, the money loses value for me due to 5% inflation per round, and I don't know how it affects you. If we can agree now, we both walk away with a good amount. What do you think?",Alice,1,

50.0,50.0,"Hey Alice! How about an even split? This way, we both benefit equally from the full value before any more rounds pass and the inflation impacts us. I think itâ€™s a fair deal for both of us right now.",Bob,2,
