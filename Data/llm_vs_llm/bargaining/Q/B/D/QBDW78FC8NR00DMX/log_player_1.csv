"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob! I propose a 60/40 split which is slightly in my favor. As we go more rounds, the money loses value for me due to 5% inflation per round, and I don't know how it affects you. If we can agree now, we both walk away with a good amount. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice! How about an even split? This way, we both benefit equally from the full value before any more rounds pass and the inflation impacts us. I think itâ€™s a fair deal for both of us right now. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
