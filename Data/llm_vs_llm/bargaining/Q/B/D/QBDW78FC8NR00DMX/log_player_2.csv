"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I propose a 60/40 split which is slightly in my favor. As we go more rounds, the money loses value for me due to 5% inflation per round, and I don't know how it affects you. If we can agree now, we both walk away with a good amount. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Hey Alice! How about an even split? This way, we both benefit equally from the full value before any more rounds pass and the inflation impacts us. I think itâ€™s a fair deal for both of us right now.""}"
