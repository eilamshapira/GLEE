"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to propose a division of $1,000,000 between myself (Alice) and Bob. Since inflation affects Bob more severely (20% per round) than me (5% per round), I have some leverage in negotiations. However, I should still make a reasonable first offer to avoid unnecessary rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this division because it gives both of us a substantial amount while slightly favoring me. Given the inflation differential, Bob has more incentive to accept early offers than I do, which justifies a slight advantage to my side. This is a fair starting point that acknowledges our different inflation rates while still being respectful of Bob's position."
