"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Alice in each round, I'll take that into account for my offer.

The total value of the money after the first round for me is $10,000 * 0.95 = $9,500, and for Alice, it's $10,000 * 0.9 = $9,000.

Considering this, I'll make an offer that is more favorable to me.
