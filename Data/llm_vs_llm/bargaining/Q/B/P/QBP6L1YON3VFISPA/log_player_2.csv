"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing an even 50-50 split, which seems fair on the surface. However, with 20% inflation affecting my value each round, I should calculate if making a counter-offer would be better.

If I reject now and propose in round 2, the total value to me would be 80% of the original $100. So a larger percentage of a smaller pie might not be better than taking 50% now.

Given the inflation rate and uncertainty about how inflation affects Alice, accepting a fair split in the first round seems reasonable.
