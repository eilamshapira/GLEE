"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a fair but slightly advantageous offer for myself, considering that I need to account for potential inflation if Bob rejects it.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. This is a reasonable split that gives Bob a significant portion while protecting my interests against potential inflation."
