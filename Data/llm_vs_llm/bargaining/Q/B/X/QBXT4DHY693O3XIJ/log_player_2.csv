"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically. 

Alice is offering me $4,500 while taking $5,500. While this isn't an even split, it's relatively close to 50-50. If I reject:
1. The next round will have 5% inflation, meaning the total value to me would be reduced to $9,500
2. I would need to make a counter-offer that Alice would accept
3. There's risk of further rounds reducing the value more

While I could try to negotiate for a more even split, the inflation penalty makes accepting a reasonable first offer more attractive. $4,500 now is better than potentially less later after several rounds of negotiation.
