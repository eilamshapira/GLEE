"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. It's Alice's turn to propose.

Here's my offer, taking into account the relative inflation rates:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

My reasoning:

*   **Alice's Perspective:** I'm proposing a 60/40 split. I'm prioritizing securing a solid amount upfront.
*   **Bob's Perspective:** Bob is facing a much steeper inflation rate (20% per round). Therefore, he's more incentivized to accept an offer now rather than risk the money losing significant value. Giving him 40% now makes the offer relatively attractive for him given his inflation rate."
