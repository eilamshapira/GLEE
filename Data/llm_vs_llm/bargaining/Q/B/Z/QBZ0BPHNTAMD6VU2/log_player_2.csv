"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Alice is offering me $40 out of $100, keeping $60 for herself. 

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but:
- The money will be worth 20% less to me ($100 becomes worth $80)
- It will be worth 10% less to Alice ($100 becomes worth $90)

My $40 now is worth more than $40 in the next round. If I reject, I'd need to get significantly more than $40 in the next round just to break even, due to the 20% depreciation.

While the split isn't perfectly equal, getting $40 now is better than risking further depreciation of value.
