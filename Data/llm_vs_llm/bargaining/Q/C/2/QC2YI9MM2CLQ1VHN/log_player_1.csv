"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my initial offer to divide the $1,000,000.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering a slightly higher portion for myself (55%) but still giving Bob a substantial amount (45%). Since we both face the risk of getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds, and Bob faces a 20% inflation penalty per round, this is a fair starting offer that acknowledges both our positions."
