"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

In Round 1, there's no inflation yet. Alice is offering me $450,000 out of $1,000,000, which is 45% of the total.

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in Round 2, but my money will be worth 20% less. So any amount I get in Round 2 will effectively be worth only 80% of its nominal value.

$450,000 now is better than a larger nominal amount that's worth less due to inflation. Plus, there's no guarantee Alice will accept a more favorable offer from me, and we risk getting nothing if we can't agree within 12 rounds.

This is a reasonable first offer, so I'll accept it.
