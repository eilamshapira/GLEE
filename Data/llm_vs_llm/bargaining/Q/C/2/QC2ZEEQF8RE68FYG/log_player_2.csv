"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair 50-50 split. This is equitable for both of us and avoids the risk of further rounds where inflation will reduce the total value. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
1. She's proposing a 50-50 split ($500,000 each)
2. It's a fair offer at face value
3. If I reject, there will be a 5% inflation penalty
4. While I could propose a split more favorable to me in the next round, Alice might reject it
5. Early agreement means we avoid value loss from inflation

The offer is reasonable, and the risk of losing value through inflation makes accepting now a prudent choice.
