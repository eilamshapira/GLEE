"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. While I rejected your initial offer, I understand we both want to maximize our gains. Due to the 20% inflation penalty I face, this is already a compromise on my part. If you reject this, you'll face inflation in the next round, and I may need to ask for more to compensate for my increased inflation penalty. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
