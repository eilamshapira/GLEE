"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Take it or leave it, Bob! I'm being generous! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer carefully, considering the impact of inflation if I reject it.

Alice is offering me $100,000 out of the $1,000,000 total, which is only 10% of the total amount. If I reject this offer, we'll move to the next round where I can make a counter-proposal, but I'll be affected by 20% inflation (meaning any amount I receive will be worth 20% less to me).

Given that I could propose a much more favorable split in the next round, and even with 20% inflation I could still come out ahead, I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer that accounts for the inflation I'm facing while being reasonable enough that Alice should accept it.

```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. While I rejected your initial offer, I understand we both want to maximize our gains. Due to the 20% inflation penalty I face, this is already a compromise on my part. If you reject this, you'll face inflation in the next round, and I may need to ask for more to compensate for my increased inflation penalty.""
