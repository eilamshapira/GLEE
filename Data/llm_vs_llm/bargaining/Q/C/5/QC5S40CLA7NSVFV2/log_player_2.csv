Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be completely fair with a 50-50 split. We're already in round 3 and the money is worth less with each round. This is the most equitable solution and we can both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
