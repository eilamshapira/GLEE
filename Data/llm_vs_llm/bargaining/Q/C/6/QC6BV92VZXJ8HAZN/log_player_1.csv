"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll play as Alice. In this game, I need to consider both my interests and the fact that inflation affects me more than Bob (20% less per round for me vs. 5% less for Bob).

For my first offer, I'll propose a fair division while accounting for the inflation asymmetry:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
