Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation, Bob, but let's be realistic. We both lose out with each passing round. Let's compromise. I'll take 58 and you take 42. This ensures we both get a decent share before the money dwindles further.

# Alice gain: 58
