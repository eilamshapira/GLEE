"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share, let's end this! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice proposes I get $40 while she gets $60
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 20% inflation, any money I get next round will be worth 20% less to me
4. If I reject, $40 next round would only be worth $32 to me

Since any counter-offer I make would be worth significantly less to me due to inflation, and $40 is a reasonable offer (even though not completely equal), I should accept this offer.
