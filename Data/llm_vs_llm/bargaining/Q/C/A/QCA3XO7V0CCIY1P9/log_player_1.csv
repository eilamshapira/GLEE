""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"

# Bob's message: Meet in the middle is fairer 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering Bob's offer, I think it's still not in my favor. Since the money I gain is worth the same, but Bob's gain is worth 20% less, I'd like to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer is worth 20% less to him in each round, I'll try to take advantage of that. Here's my new offer:

""bob_gain"": 350000, 
""message"": ""Considering inflation, this split favors your initial value""}"

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation considered, need a better split 
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","With Bob's gain being worth 48.8% less, I have more leverage. However, his offer is still not very favorable to me. I'll consider accepting it, but I think I can get a better deal if I negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's gain is worth 48.8% less, and it will decrease further, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself. Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 700000, 
""bob_gain"": 300000, 
""message"": ""Last chance for a reasonable split, inflation is killing your share""}"
