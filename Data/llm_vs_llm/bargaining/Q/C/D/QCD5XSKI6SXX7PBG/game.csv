737856.0,262144.0,"Hi Bob, I propose dividing the million as $737856 for me and $262144 for you. Given that any delay will cost you 20% per round while my take remains undiminished, accepting now secures you $262144 in full value rather than a discounted outcome later. I believe this split is fair considering our future prospects—please accept my offer.",Alice,1,

500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Alice, let's split the money evenly at $500000 each. This way, we both walk away with a fair share, and we avoid any loss due to my 20% per round penalty. I think this is a balanced and equitable approach for both of us. I hope you agree!",Bob,2,

999999.0,1.0,"Hi Bob, as we move into round 3 your delay only deepens your inflation penalty. If you reject, you'll propose in round 4—but by then you'll be forced to concede almost the entire pot to me by round 5, given your 40% discount and my undiminished position. Accepting this offer gives you a positive return, however small, instead of nearly nothing. Please accept.",Alice,3,

530000.0,470000.0,"Hi Alice, I understand the challenge of inflation on my end, so I'm offering you $530000 and taking $470000 for myself. This proposal recognizes the tight spot I'm in, while still ensuring you receive a larger portion. Let's make a deal that benefits us both before my situation worsens further. Hope you consider this proposal fairly!",Bob,4,

590400.0,409600.0,"Hi Bob, in round 5 the value of any money you receive is discounted to 40.96% of its face value, while mine remains undiminished. To avoid further loss in value if we delay, I'm offering you $409600 now – which, when discounted, is worth about $167772. That is exactly what you can expect to secure in your next round as proposer, but with the added risk of further losses. Accepting this offer guarantees you that effective value immediately, so I hope you'll agree to this fair division.",Alice,5,
