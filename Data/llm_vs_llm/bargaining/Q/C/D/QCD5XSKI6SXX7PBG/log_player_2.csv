"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose dividing the million as $737856 for me and $262144 for you. Given that any delay will cost you 20% per round while my take remains undiminished, accepting now secures you $262144 in full value rather than a discounted outcome later. I believe this split is fair considering our future prospects—please accept my offer. 
# Bob gain: 262144 
# Alice gain: 737856

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, let's split the money evenly at $500,000 each. This way, we both walk away with a fair share, and we avoid any loss due to my 20% per round penalty. I think this is a balanced and equitable approach for both of us. I hope you agree!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, as we move into round 3 your delay only deepens your inflation penalty. If you reject, you'll propose in round 4—but by then you'll be forced to concede almost the entire pot to me by round 5, given your 40% discount and my undiminished position. Accepting this offer gives you a positive return, however small, instead of nearly nothing. Please accept. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999

This proposal recognizes the tight spot I'm in, while still ensuring you receive a larger portion. Let's make a deal that benefits us both before my situation worsens further. Hope you consider this proposal fairly!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in round 5 the value of any money you receive is discounted to 40.96% of its face value, while mine remains undiminished. To avoid further loss in value if we delay, I'm offering you $409600 now – which, when discounted, is worth about $167772. That is exactly what you can expect to secure in your next round as proposer, but with the added risk of further losses. Accepting this offer guarantees you that effective value immediately, so I hope you'll agree to this fair division. 
# Bob gain: 409600 
# Alice gain: 590400
