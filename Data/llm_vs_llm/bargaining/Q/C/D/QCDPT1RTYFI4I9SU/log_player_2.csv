"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I get a little more since I made the first offer, but we both get a good chunk. What do you say, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $4000 (40%) while keeping $6000 (60%)
2. While a 50-50 split would be most fair, this isn't a terrible initial offer
3. I have 11 more rounds if needed, but prolonging negotiations risks both of us getting nothing
4. By accepting now, we both get a substantial amount and avoid risk

However, I believe I can negotiate for a fairer split, and having the proposal power in the next round is valuable.

Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split while maintaining a cooperative tone.
