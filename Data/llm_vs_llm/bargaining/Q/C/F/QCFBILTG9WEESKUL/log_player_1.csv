"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Split it evenly, no need to wait""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight advantage for me, but still fair. Let's not lose more value. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the 10% inflation, the actual values would be:
Alice gain: 45 * 0.9 = 40.5
Bob gain: 55 * 0.9 = 49.5

I don't think this is a fair offer. I'd like to try and get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the 10% inflation in each round, the money is now worth 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 of its original value.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 52, 
""bob_gain"": 48, 
""message"": ""My turn, slightly in my favor, let's end this""}"
