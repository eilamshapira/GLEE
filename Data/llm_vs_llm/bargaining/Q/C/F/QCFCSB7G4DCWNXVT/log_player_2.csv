"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you a fair 400k. Consider that with each round, your money loses 20% value. If you reject this, you'll need a much larger sum in later rounds just to match this offer's current value. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your initial offer, but I propose an even split of 600k for me and 400k for you. Remember, your money devalues at a slower rate, so you still gain significant value. Let's reach an agreement early for mutual benefit.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical. Your previous offer is actually worse for both of us due to inflation. At this point, your 450k is worth about the same as 600k was in round 1 due to your 20% per round inflation. This is a fair offer considering the devaluation, and further delays will significantly reduce the real value for both of us, especially for you. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000

Round 4

This takes into account our respective inflation rates, and it ensures both of us receive a fair share before further devaluation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your movement toward a more balanced split. This offer of 475k to you is actually worth more than your previous offer of 540k would be now, due to the compound inflation effect. We're approaching the halfway point of our negotiation window, and your money is devaluing at 20% per round. This is a fair offer that benefits us both - let's conclude this deal before further devaluation hurts us both. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000
