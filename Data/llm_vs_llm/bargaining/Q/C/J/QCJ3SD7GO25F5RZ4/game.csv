60.0,40.0,"I suggest a fair 60-40 split. Since you face 20% depreciation per round, this is actually a good deal for you, as waiting will reduce your money's value.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Considering my loss due to depreciation, I think 55-45 is a fairer split. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need a bit more to offset the loss.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
65.0,35.0,"With 40% total depreciation on your side after two rounds, this 35% offer is still worth more to you now than waiting further. Let's conclude this efficiently.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
48.0,52.0,"Despite the depreciation, I'm still willing to find a middle ground. A 52-48 split is more reasonable, considering my losses are increasing each round.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
70.0,30.0,Your money has depreciated by almost 60% now. This 30% offer is actually worth more to you than waiting further and facing more depreciation. This is your best option at this point.,Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
50.0,50.0,"At this point, I'm willing to split it down the middle. Considering my significant losses due to depreciation, I think 50-50 is a reasonable compromise.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
75.0,25.0,Your money has depreciated by almost 75% now. This 25% offer is actually worth more to you than what you'd get after further rounds of depreciation. Let's end this now before your share loses even more value.,Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
52.0,48.0,"I'm still trying to find a compromise. Given the extreme depreciation I'm facing, I think 48-52 is a reasonable split at this point. I'm willing to settle for less, but I need something closer to half.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
80.0,20.0,"With only 3 rounds left and your money worth less than 20% of its original value, this 20% offer is your best remaining option. Further delays will only reduce your share's value more dramatically.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
55.0,45.0,"I know my share's value is severely diminished, but I'm still trying to get the best deal possible. A 45-55 split is my next offer. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't go much lower.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
85.0,15.0,"This is the second-to-last round. Your money is worth less than 11% of its original value now. Take this 15% offer - it's better than what you'll get if we go to the final round, where you'll face even more depreciation.",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,reject
60.0,40.0,"This is my final offer. I know my share's value is extremely low, but I'm trying to get something out of this. A 40-60 split is my last attempt at a compromise. If you reject, we both get nothing.",Bob,12,
,,,Alice,12,accept
