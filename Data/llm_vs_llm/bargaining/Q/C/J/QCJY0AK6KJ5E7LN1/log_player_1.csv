"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me make a strategic first offer. Given that money loses value faster for Bob (10% per round) than for me (5% per round), I should propose a reasonable split to encourage acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this 60-40 split because:
1. It gives Bob a significant portion ($4000)
2. If Bob rejects, their next offer will be worth less due to 10% inflation
3. It's fair enough to potentially be accepted while giving me a good outcome"
