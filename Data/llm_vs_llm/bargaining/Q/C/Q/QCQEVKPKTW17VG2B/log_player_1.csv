"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: How about we split it 47.5/52.5? This way we both benefit more than before. 
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, I need to consider the actual value I'll get. 

To calculate the value, I'll multiply my gain by 0.9 (1 - 0.10 inflation). 
So, the actual value I'll get is: 525000 * 0.9 = 472500.

Considering this, I think I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, now it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, the money I gain is worth 10% less in each round, and the money Bob gains is worth 5% less in each round.

In Round 1, the values were:
- My gain: 100%
- Bob's gain: 100%

In Round 2, the values were:
- My gain: 90% (100% - 10%)
- Bob's gain: 95% (100% - 5%)

In Round 3, the values will be:
- My gain: 81% (90% - 10% of 90% = 90% * 0.9 = 81%)
- Bob's gain: 90.25% (95% - 5% of 95% = 95% * 0.95 = 90.25%)

To calculate the actual values, I'll multiply my gain by 0.81 and Bob's gain by 0.9025.

Let's make an offer:
{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""It's my turn again, let's make a deal before it's too late""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try 49.5/50.5. We're almost at an even split, and it gets us both a fair share. 
# Alice gain: 505000 
# Bob gain: 495000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, and 10% less than in the previous round (as it was 17.1% less in Round 3, 10% less in Round 2, and now it's 27.1% less), I need to consider the actual value I'll get.

To calculate the value, I'll multiply my gain by (1 - 0.271) = 0.729.
So, the actual value I'll get is: 505000 * 0.729 = 368145.

Considering this, I think I should accept this offer, as the difference between my gain and Bob's gain is relatively small, and the inflation is significantly reducing the value of the money.
