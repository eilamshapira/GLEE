"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. This seems equitable for both of us. Keep in mind that with inflation, delaying will reduce the value for me by 10% each round, and possibly for you too. Let's agree now and both walk away with $5000. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice offers a 50-50 split ($5000 each)
2. If I reject, the next round my $5000 would be worth 5% less ($4750 in real value)
3. Alice mentions her inflation is 10%, but I can't be certain about that
4. A 50-50 split is generally considered fair
5. Getting a significantly better deal might require multiple rounds, during which inflation will eat into my gains

Given that:
- The offer is fair
- I know for certain I lose 5% value per round
- This is the first round, so no value has been lost yet
- Future negotiations might result in worse outcomes due to inflation
