"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, it's my turn to propose. Considering the inflation and the urgency of the situation, I need to make a reasonable offer that Alice will accept.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm proposing to take $550,000 and give Alice $450,000. This is more generous to Alice than her offer was to me, and hopefully, she'll see the value in accepting it to avoid further losses due to inflation."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, it's my turn again. Inflation is really starting to bite. I need to be smart about this.

```json
{
""bob_gain"": 520000,
""alice_gain"": 480000
}
```

I am proposing to take $520,000 and give Alice $480,000. This is still a significant amount for her, and I'm hoping the increased value to her (compared to my previous offer and her offers) will be enough to convince her to accept."
