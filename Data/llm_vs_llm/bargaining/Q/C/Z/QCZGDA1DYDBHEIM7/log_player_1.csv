"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make my first offer to Bob and consider the inflation aspect.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing an equal split of the $100. This is fair and acknowledges that we both deserve an equal share of the money. I believe a 50-50 split respects both of our interests and gives us both a reasonable amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm accepting Bob's offer because with inflation effects considered, this is reasonable. If I reject and we move to another round, my share would be worth even less due to the 10% inflation per round. Given that Bob's inflation rate is higher than mine (20% vs 10%), his position becomes weaker faster, but the absolute decrease in value makes accepting now a pragmatic choice."
