"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me make a strategic first offer. Since Bob's money loses value faster than mine (10% vs 5% per round), he has more incentive to accept an early deal. However, I shouldn't be too aggressive to avoid immediate rejection.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which gives Bob a substantial portion while still being advantageous for me. This split acknowledges that we both benefit from an early agreement due to inflation, while giving me a favorable position as the first mover."
