"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is terrible for Bob, even with inflation.  There's a small chance Alice is desperate to end the game and might offer something better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}
``` 

This is my final offer. It's a fair split and avoids the risk of getting even less in future rounds due to inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I have no choice now. If I reject this offer, I risk getting nothing in the next round with the increasing inflation working against me."
