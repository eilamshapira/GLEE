"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a proposal for dividing the $10,000 between Bob and me. Given that inflation reduces the value by 5% each round for me, I should try to make a fair offer that Bob is likely to accept right away.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose a 50-50 split, which I believe is fair and gives both of us an equal share of the money."
