"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. A 50-50 split seems fair at first glance, but I need to consider the inflation factor.

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but the total value will be worth 10% less to me. That means the $10,000 would effectively be worth $9,000 to me in the next round.

With the current offer, I get $5,000. If I reject and try to negotiate for more in the next round, even if I managed to get $6,000, it would be worth $5,400 to me due to inflation (90% of $6,000).

The 50-50 split is fair and avoiding inflation makes this a reasonable offer.
