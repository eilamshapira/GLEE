90.0,10.0,"Let's be fair, I'll take the majority and you get a small share.  What do you say?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
32.0,68.0,"Alice, the clock is ticking and further rounds will only erode our gains. Considering that your money loses 10% per round while mine only 5%, I propose we avoid unnecessary delays. Accept $32 for you and $68 for me now—it's a fair and timely solution for both of us.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
60.0,40.0,"Bob, you're getting greedy. You're only losing 5% per round, while my losses are much higher. This offer is more than fair given our current circumstances. Accept and let's end this before we both lose even more.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
45.0,55.0,"Alice, as you well know, each round increases your loss more than mine. In round 4, your money’s value is reduced by roughly 27% versus about 14% for mine. By reaching an agreement now, you secure a nominal $45 (worth about $33 in effective value) instead of risking further devaluation. I’m proposing a split of $55 for me and $45 for you so we can both avoid additional losses. I believe this is a fair compromise given our respective inflation penalties.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
50.0,50.0,"Bob, we're both losing a lot of money with each passing round.  Let's be reasonable and split the remaining value evenly.  Accept this offer and we both walk away with something.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
31.0,69.0,"Alice, we both know that every extra round further erodes the value of our money—mine by about 5% and yours by 10% each round. Based on our discount factors, if you hold out for the next round, you’re likely to end up with an effective value of roughly $18.33. By accepting my offer now, you secure $31 nominally (worth about the same effective value given your discount), while I get $69 (worth approximately $53.33 effective). This is the equilibrium outcome if we were to continue bargaining, so it’s in both our interests to agree now rather than lose more value.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
40.0,60.0,"Bob, we're in a tough spot.  But it's clear that you're trying to take advantage of the situation.  I'm still willing to negotiate, but I won't accept an offer that's so heavily skewed in your favor.  This is the best I can offer.  Accept it and let's end this.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
46.0,54.0,"Alice, every extra round chips away at what we can both take home. In round 8 my dollars are discounted by about 30%, while yours are down by roughly 52%. If we delay, you’d get to propose in round 9, but your effective value would be even lower. By settling now with $46 for you (worth about 46 × 0.4783 ≈ $22.0 in effective value) and $54 for me (worth roughly 54 × 0.6983 ≈ $37.7), you’ll secure nearly as much as you’d expect by waiting—but we both avoid further losses. I believe this is a fair and mutually beneficial proposal. Accept it and let’s end this before more value evaporates.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
35.0,65.0,"Bob, we're running out of time, and I'm losing value much faster than you. This is the best I can do. Accept it, or we both walk away with nothing.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
5.0,95.0,"Alice, as we enter round 10, every moment we delay results in significant devaluation—my dollars are now only worth about 63% of their original value and yours only 39%. If you reject this offer, you'll have the chance to propose in round 11, but historically that position would force you into giving me nearly all of the $100 to ensure my acceptance, leaving you with only about $5 nominally (which is even less effective due to deeper discounting). To avoid further losses, I’m offering you $5 nominal now, which translates to roughly 1.94 effective dollars, a slight improvement over your round 11 fallback of about 1.74. I believe this is the best we can do given the circumstances—let’s settle now rather than watch our potential gains evaporate further.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
10.0,90.0,"Bob, we're down to the wire. I'm losing a lot of value with each passing round.  This is the best I can do. Accept it, or we both walk away with nothing.",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,reject
2.0,98.0,"Alice, this is it—the final round. If we don’t agree now, we both walk away empty-handed. I know the inflation has eaten significantly into your gains, but if you reject this offer you'll end up with nothing at all. I'm offering you $2, which may seem small but is far better than a zero payout. Let's end this costly cycle and salvage what value we have left. Please, accept this final offer.",Bob,12,
