Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the clock is ticking and further rounds will only erode our gains. Considering that your money loses 10% per round while mine only 5%, I propose we avoid unnecessary delays. Accept $32 for you and $68 for me now—it's a fair and timely solution for both of us.

# Bob gain: 68

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, as you well know, each round increases your loss more than mine. In round 4, your money’s value is reduced by roughly 27% versus about 14% for mine. By reaching an agreement now, you secure a nominal $45 (worth about $33 in effective value) instead of risking further devaluation. I’m proposing a split of $55 for me and $45 for you so we can both avoid additional losses. I believe this is a fair compromise given our respective inflation penalties.

# Bob gain: 55

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we both know that every extra round further erodes the value of our money—mine by about 5% and yours by 10% each round. Based on our discount factors, if you hold out for the next round, you’re likely to end up with an effective value of roughly $18.33. By accepting my offer now, you secure $31 nominally (worth about the same effective value given your discount), while I get $69 (worth approximately $53.33 effective). This is the equilibrium outcome if we were to continue bargaining, so it’s in both our interests to agree now rather than lose more value.

# Bob gain: 69

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every extra round chips away at what we can both take home. In round 8 my dollars are discounted by about 30%, while yours are down by roughly 52%. If we delay, you’d get to propose in round 9, but your effective value would be even lower. By settling now with $46 for you (worth about 46 × 0.4783 ≈ $22.0 in effective value) and $54 for me (worth roughly 54 × 0.6983 ≈ $37.7), you’ll secure nearly as much as you’d expect by waiting—but we both avoid further losses. I believe this is a fair and mutually beneficial proposal. Accept it and let’s end this before more value evaporates.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 36.98% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, as we enter round 10, every moment we delay results in significant devaluation—my dollars are now only worth about 63% of their original value and yours only 39%. If you reject this offer, you'll have the chance to propose in round 11, but historically that position would force you into giving me nearly all of the $100 to ensure my acceptance, leaving you with only about $5 nominally (which is even less effective due to deeper discounting). To avoid further losses, I’m offering you $5 nominal now, which translates to roughly 1.94 effective dollars, a slight improvement over your round 11 fallback of about 1.74. I believe this is the best we can do given the circumstances—let’s settle now rather than watch our potential gains evaporate further.

I know the inflation has eaten significantly into your gains, but if you reject this offer you'll end up with nothing at all. I'm offering you $2, which may seem small but is far better than a zero payout. Let's end this costly cycle and salvage what value we have left. Please, accept this final offer.
