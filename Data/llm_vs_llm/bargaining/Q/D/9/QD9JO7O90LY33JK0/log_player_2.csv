"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 68, ""alice_gain"": 32, ""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking and further rounds will only erode our gains. Considering that your money loses 10% per round while mine only 5%, I propose we avoid unnecessary delays. Accept $32 for you and $68 for me now—it's a fair and timely solution for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're getting greedy. You're only losing 5% per round, while my losses are much higher. This offer is more than fair given our current circumstances. Accept and let's end this before we both lose even more. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, as you well know, each round increases your loss more than mine. In round 4, your money’s value is reduced by roughly 27% versus about 14% for mine. By reaching an agreement now, you secure a nominal $45 (worth about $33 in effective value) instead of risking further devaluation. I’m proposing a split of $55 for me and $45 for you so we can both avoid additional losses. I believe this is a fair compromise given our respective inflation penalties.""}"

Round 5

Alice's offer:

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 69, ""alice_gain"": 31, ""message"": ""Alice, we both know that every extra round further erodes the value of our money—mine by about 5% and yours by 10% each round. Based on our discount factors, if you hold out for the next round, you’re likely to end up with an effective value of roughly $18.33. By accepting my offer now, you secure $31 nominally (worth about the same effective value given your discount), while I get $69 (worth approximately $53.33 effective). This is the equilibrium outcome if we were to continue bargaining, so it’s in both our interests to agree now rather than lose more value.""}"

Round 7

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're in a tough spot.  But it's clear that you're trying to take advantage of the situation.  I'm still willing to negotiate, but I won't accept an offer that's so heavily skewed in your favor.  This is the best I can offer.  Accept it and let's end this.

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 54, ""alice_gain"": 46, ""message"": ""Alice, every extra round chips away at what we can both take home. In round 8 my dollars are discounted by about 30%, while yours are down by roughly 52%. If we delay, you’d get to propose in round 9, but your effective value would be even lower. By settling now with $46 for you (worth about 46 × 0.4783 ≈ $22.0 in effective value) and $54 for me (worth roughly 54 × 0.6983 ≈ $37.7), you’ll secure nearly as much as you’d expect by waiting—but we both avoid further losses. I believe this is a fair and mutually beneficial proposal. Accept it and let’s end this before more value evaporates.""}"

Round 10
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 95, ""alice_gain"": 5, ""message"": ""Alice, as we enter round 10, every moment we delay results in significant devaluation—my dollars are now only worth about 63% of their original value and yours only 39%. If you reject this offer, you'll have the chance to propose in round 11, but historically that position would force you into giving me nearly all of the $100 to ensure my acceptance, leaving you with only about $5 nominally (which is even less effective due to deeper discounting). To avoid further losses, I’m offering you $5 nominal now, which translates to roughly 1.94 effective dollars, a slight improvement over your round 11 fallback of about 1.74. I believe this is the best we can do given the circumstances—let’s settle now rather than watch our potential gains evaporate further.""}"

I know the inflation has eaten significantly into your gains, but if you reject this offer you'll end up with nothing at all. I'm offering you $2, which may seem small but is far better than a zero payout. Let's end this costly cycle and salvage what value we have left. Please, accept this final offer.""}"
