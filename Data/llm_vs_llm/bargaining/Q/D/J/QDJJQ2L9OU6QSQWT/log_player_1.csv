Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn, let's make it more even, considering the inflation, it's better to agree sooner 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting us nowhere. I'm offering a bit less than last time, but it's still a fair deal considering the inflation is hitting you harder.""

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is indeed hitting me harder, but I still believe we can find a more balanced split, let's try to meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

I'm rejecting this offer. While Bob acknowledges the inflation disparity, the split still heavily favors him.  I need to push for a larger share before inflation eats away too much of my potential gains."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking, and the value is shrinking. This offer is fair, and it ensures we both walk away with something substantial.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, and inflation is killing me. Let's split it 50/50 and walk away with what we can 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the most logical choice. The inflation heavily impacts Bob, making him more likely to propose this even split as time runs out. Accepting now ensures I walk away with something rather than risking getting nothing if we both continue to be stubborn."
