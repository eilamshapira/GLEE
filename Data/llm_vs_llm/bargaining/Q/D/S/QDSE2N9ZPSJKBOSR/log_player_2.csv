Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice's offer is getting better, but it's still not in my favor. I'm willing to risk another round of inflation to see if I can get a better deal."

This is my final offer. It's a fair 50/50 split, even with the inflation considered.  Alice would be wise to accept, as further rounds will only diminish the total value."
