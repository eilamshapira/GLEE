"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, 55/45 is a good split 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same, but Bob's offer is 55/45, which is still not in my favor as much as my initial offer, and considering the fact that Bob's gain is worth 5% less, I will reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was rejected and the money is worth 5% less for him in each round, I'll try to take advantage of this. I'll make a slightly more favorable offer for myself, but still try to be reasonable.

""bob_gain"": 350000, 
""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust the split to 65/35""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is killing me, let's end this with a 60/40 split 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is now a 60/40 split, which is the same as my initial offer in Round 1. Considering that the money I gain is still worth the same, but Bob's gain is now worth 14.26% less due to inflation, this offer is actually more favorable to me than it was initially.
