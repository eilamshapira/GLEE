"Round 1
Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me after each round, I'll make a more favorable offer to Alice to try to end the game early.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, let's adjust the split to 65/35 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my potential gain is decreasing, so I should try to accept a reasonable offer sooner rather than later.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth even less for me now (14.76% less than in the first round, due to 5% decrease in each of the 3 rounds: 1 - 0.05 = 0.95, 0.95 - 0.05 = 0.9025, 0.9025 - 0.05 = 0.857375, or 1 - (0.05)^3 = 0.857375, 1 - 0.857375 = 0.142625, 0.142625 * 100 = 14.2625%), I'll make an even more favorable offer to Alice to try to end the game.
