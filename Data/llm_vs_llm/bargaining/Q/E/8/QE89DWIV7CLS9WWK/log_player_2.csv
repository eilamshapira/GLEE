"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically.

Current offer: $40 for me, $60 for Alice

Considerations:
1. This is the first round, so no inflation has occurred yet
2. Rejecting means the next offer would be worth 5% less
3. $40 is a decent amount, though less than half
4. I have bargaining power to counter-offer if I reject
5. However, there's risk in prolonged negotiation due to inflation

While I could try to negotiate for more, the 5% inflation penalty makes aggressive bargaining risky. $40 is a reasonable offer that I might not improve upon significantly after accounting for inflation.
