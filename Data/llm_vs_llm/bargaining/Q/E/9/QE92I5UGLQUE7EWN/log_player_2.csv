Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each round, I'll make a fair offer considering the current value.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $35 I would gain is actually worth around $28.35 to me (since it's 19% less valuable). 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth even less for me now (10% less than the previous round, which was already 19% less than the initial round), I'll make an offer that takes this into account. The total devaluation for me is 28.9% (19% + 10% of 81% = 10% * 0.81 = 8.1%, 19% + 8.1% = 27.1%, rounding to 28.9% for simplicity, but actually it is 10% + 9.09% = 19% * 0.9 = 17.1%, 10% + 17.1% = 27.1%, 10% of the 81 is 8.1, so 19% + 8.1 is 27.1), so I'll aim for a bit more to compensate.
