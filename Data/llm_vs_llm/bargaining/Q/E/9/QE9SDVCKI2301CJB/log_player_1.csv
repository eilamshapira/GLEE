"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair first offer to establish good faith, but leave myself a slight advantage as the first mover.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}

I propose this split because it's close to equal while giving me a small edge, which seems reasonable as the first mover. It's fair enough that Bob should seriously consider accepting rather than letting inflation reduce the total value in the next round."
