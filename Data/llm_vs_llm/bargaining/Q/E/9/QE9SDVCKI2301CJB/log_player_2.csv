"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer. She's proposing to give me $4,800 and keep $5,200 for herself out of the $10,000.

If I reject, I'll get to make a counter-offer in the next round, but the total amount will decrease by 10% to $9,000. This means even if I proposed a 50-50 split in the next round, I would get $4,500, which is less than the $4,800 Alice is offering now.

Since Alice's current offer gives me more than I would likely get in the next round (considering the 10% inflation penalty), I should accept.
