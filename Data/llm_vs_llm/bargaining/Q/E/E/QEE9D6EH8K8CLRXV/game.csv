5500.0,4500.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that slightly favors me as the first mover. I'm taking some consideration of our different inflation rates - if we delay, we both lose value. Let's settle this quickly and both walk away with a good amount.",Alice,1,

4800.0,5200.0,"Alice, considering our different inflation rates (10% for you vs 5% for me per round), this is actually a fair offer. If you reject, your next offer will be worth significantly less to you due to your higher inflation rate. Let's settle this now and both walk away with a good amount.",Bob,2,

5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, let's be fair here. We both face inflation, and while mine is higher, we're both losing value with each round. This is a reasonable offer that gives us both a substantial amount. Let's not drag this out further and agree to this balanced split.",Alice,3,
