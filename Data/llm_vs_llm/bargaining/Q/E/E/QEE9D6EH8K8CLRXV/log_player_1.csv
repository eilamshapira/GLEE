"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering our different inflation rates (10% for you vs 5% for me per round), this is actually a fair offer. If you reject, your next offer will be worth significantly less to you due to your higher inflation rate. Let's settle this now and both walk away with a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
