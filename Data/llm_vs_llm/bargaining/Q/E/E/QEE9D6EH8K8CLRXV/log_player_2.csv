"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that slightly favors me as the first mover. I'm taking some consideration of our different inflation rates - if we delay, we both lose value. Let's settle this quickly and both walk away with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

The offer is somewhat reasonable considering:
1. Alice acknowledges the inflation rates difference (5% for me vs 10% for her)
2. If I reject, my next offer would be worth 5% less to me
3. It's a 45%-55% split, which isn't terribly unfair

However, I could potentially get a better deal in the next round, since:
1. Alice's money would be worth 10% less to her, putting more pressure on her to accept
2. I would have control over the proposal
3. The split is currently favoring Alice more than necessary

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a strategic offer that accounts for our different inflation rates and the fact that Alice's money loses value faster than mine.

{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Alice, considering our different inflation rates (10% for you vs 5% for me per round), this is actually a fair offer. If you reject, your next offer will be worth significantly less to you due to your higher inflation rate. Let's settle this now and both walk away with a good amount.""}

My reasoning:
1. I'm offering a 52-48 split in my favor, which is reasonable given I have the proposal power this round
2. The offer emphasizes the higher cost of delay for Alice (10% vs 5%)
3. The message is constructive and highlights the mutual benefit of settling now
4. The split is still fair enough that it should be attractive to Alice"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be fair here. We both face inflation, and while mine is higher, we're both losing value with each round. This is a reasonable offer that gives us both a substantial amount. Let's not drag this out further and agree to this balanced split. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Current value assessment:
- If I accept $4800 now, it's worth $4800 * (1 - 0.0975) = $4332 in round 1 value
- For Alice, her $5200 is worth $5200 * (1 - 0.19) = $4212 in round 1 value

2. If I reject:
- Next round will have another 5% depreciation for me (total 14.75%)
- Alice will face another 10% depreciation (total 29%)
- But I'll have control over the proposal

3. Considering:
- The difference in our current effective gains is relatively small
- Further delays will hurt both of us significantly
- The 48-52 split is actually quite reasonable given the circumstances
- Alice has moved from her initial 45-55 split to a more balanced offer

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because the split is fair when accounting for inflation, and further negotiation rounds would likely result in worse outcomes for both of us due to compounding inflation effects."
