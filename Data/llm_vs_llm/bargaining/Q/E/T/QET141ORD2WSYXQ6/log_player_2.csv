"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it evenly, no need to wait 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. With a 5% inflation penalty per round, if I reject this offer:
* Next round my money would be worth 5% less
* I could propose a better split, but Alice might reject
* Fair splits often lead to successful negotiations
* $500,000 is a significant amount

The 50-50 split is fair, and waiting would only reduce my share's value. With inflation risk and limited rounds, accepting a fair first offer is reasonable.
