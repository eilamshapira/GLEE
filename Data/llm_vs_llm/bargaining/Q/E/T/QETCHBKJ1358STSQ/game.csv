70.0,30.0,"Hi Bob, I'd like to propose that I take $70 and you get $30. Since the money loses less value for me with each round, I think this is a fair division for us both right now. What do you think?",Alice,1,

40.0,60.0,"Hi Alice, since the value of money decreases more for me each round, I propose $60 for me and $40 for you. This way, we both get a fair share considering the inflation impact. What do you think?",Bob,2,

60.0,40.0,"Hey Bob, given that the value reduces more quickly for you, I propose you take $40 and I take $60 this round. This way, you still get a decent amount even after inflation. Let me know what you think!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
30.0,70.0,"Hi Alice, considering the significant impact of inflation on my share, I propose $70 for me and $30 for you this round. This way, I can still get a reasonable amount after the value loss. What do you think?",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
55.0,45.0,"Hey Bob, let's try to reach a middle ground. I'll propose $55 for me and $45 for you this round. I hope this feels fairer given the inflation impact on both our ends. Let me know if this works for you!",Alice,5,
