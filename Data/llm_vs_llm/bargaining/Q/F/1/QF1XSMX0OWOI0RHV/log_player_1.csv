"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a proposal for dividing the $10,000 between myself (Alice) and Bob.

Given the 20% inflation per round for me, I should try to make a fair offer that Bob will likely accept early, as waiting would decrease the value for me significantly.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose a 50-50 split. This is the fairest division, giving us each exactly half of the money."
