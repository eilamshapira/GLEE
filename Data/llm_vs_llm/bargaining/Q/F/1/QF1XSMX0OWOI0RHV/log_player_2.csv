"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
- She proposes an even 50-50 split of $5000 each
- This is the first round, so no inflation has occurred yet
- The split is perfectly fair
- There's always a risk that future negotiations could lead to worse outcomes
- I could try to get more, but Alice might retaliate with worse offers

Given this is a fair offer right from the start and there's risk in continuing, I'll accept.
