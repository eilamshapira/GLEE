"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we settle now to avoid further devaluation on my side. I take $2000 and you get $8000â€”it's a generous and fair offer given that waiting costs me 20% per round. Let's agree and close the deal quickly! 
# Bob gain: 8000 
# Alice gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $8000 (80%) of the total amount
2. She's revealing that she faces 20% inflation per round
3. This is a very generous offer for me
4. If I reject, I could propose next round, but:
   - Alice might reject my higher offer due to her inflation penalty
   - There's no guarantee I'd get a better deal

Given that:
- The offer gives me a very good share (80%)
- I don't face any inflation penalty myself
- Alice has a strong incentive to settle now due to her inflation rate
- This is a fair and generous offer
