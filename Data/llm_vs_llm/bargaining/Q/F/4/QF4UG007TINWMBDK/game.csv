512820.0,487180.0,"Hi Bob, let's settle now and avoid any further devaluation. I propose $512820 for me and $487180 for youâ€”which reflects our respective positions given the 5% devaluation each round.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"I think we both want to avoid further devaluation. Considering the current situation, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. It's better for both of us to settle now.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob's offer gives me $450000 in a round where the pie is worth less than initially. If I reject, I'll become the proposer in round 3, and in equilibrium I expect to secure an outcome closer to my continuation value (around $462500 in round 3). So, I'd rather reject this offer to aim for a division that reflects my proposer advantage despite further devaluation.",Alice,2,reject
512820.0,487180.0,"Hi Bob, I propose a 512820 / 487180 split in our favor, reflecting our respective continuation values. By settling now in round 3, we avoid further devaluation and secure our fair shares. I believe this offer is as good for you as waiting for the next round.",Alice,3,

480000.0,520000.0,"Considering the significant devaluation so far, I'm willing to make a compromise. I propose a 52-48 split in my favor. This way, we both minimize our losses and secure a reasonable share.",Bob,4,
,,"Hi Bob, I understand that the continuing devaluation makes every delay costly for us both. Given the 14.26% depreciation so far, your offer of $480000 for me and $520000 for you represents a reasonable compromise compared to the risk of further loss. Let's settle now and avoid any further devaluation.",Alice,4,accept
