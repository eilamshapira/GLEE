"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we both want to avoid further devaluation. Considering the current situation, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. It's better for both of us to settle now.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob's offer gives me $450,000 in a round where the pie is worth less than initially. If I reject, I'll become the proposer in round 3, and in equilibrium I expect to secure an outcome closer to my continuation value (around $462,500 in round 3). So, I'd rather reject this offer to aim for a division that reflects my proposer advantage despite further devaluation.""}"

Round 4
