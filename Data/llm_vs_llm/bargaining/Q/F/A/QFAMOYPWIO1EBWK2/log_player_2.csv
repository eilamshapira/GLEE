"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split, let's be reasonable 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I receive $4,000 while she gets $6,000. This is a 40-60 split in her favor.

Given that I face a 5% inflation penalty per round, if I reject and make a counter-offer, the total value will decrease to $9,500 for the next round. Even if I were to get a larger percentage in the next round, the absolute value would be less.

I think I can negotiate for a more favorable split, especially since we're just in the first round and have 11 more rounds if needed. The inflation isn't too punishing yet.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more balanced while acknowledging the inflation risk we both face.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. This is equitable for both of us, and we can avoid further rounds of inflation that would reduce the total amount for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer, slightly better for you, let's settle 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice something interesting - Alice isn't affected by inflation the same way I am. This changes the dynamics. For me, the money is worth 9.75% less than in round 1, but Alice doesn't face this penalty.

Alice has offered me $4,200 while she takes $5,800. Given my inflation penalty, this $4,200 is actually worth about $3,791 (after 9.75% reduction) in round 1 terms for me.

Alice only improved her offer slightly from $4,000 to $4,200, which doesn't adequately account for my inflation disadvantage. Since I'm the only one facing inflation penalties, waiting longer primarily hurts me, giving Alice leverage.

I need to negotiate for a better split given this asymmetry, but also be mindful that prolonging too much will significantly reduce my take.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Now I understand the dynamics better. I need to account for the inflation that affects only my side while making a reasonable offer.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""I've noticed that inflation only affects my gains, not yours. This puts me at a disadvantage the longer we negotiate. Given this asymmetry, I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor to offset the inflation effect. This is fair considering I'll lose value with each round while you don't.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering your concerns, I'm willing to meet in the middle, slightly above my last offer 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this situation. Alice is only offering me $4,300, which with my 18.55% inflation penalty is actually worth about $3,502 in round 1 terms. 

She's only increased her offer by $100 from the last round, which is minimal given the significant inflation I'm facing. Meanwhile, she faces no inflation at all, which gives her a strong advantage to simply wait me out.

Given that the inflation increases with each round and only affects me, the longer this negotiation goes, the worse my position becomes. At this rate, even if I eventually got a higher percentage, the absolute value might be lower due to compounding inflation.

While I'd prefer a more equitable split, I need to be pragmatic about the asymmetric inflation.
