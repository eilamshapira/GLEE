"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that slightly favors me since I face a 5% inflation penalty each round. If you reject and we go to the next round, my money would be worth less. This offer gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging my disadvantage. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice claims she faces 5% inflation per round, while I face 0% inflation
2. The current offer gives me $475,000 and her $525,000
3. If I reject:
   - Next round I can make a counter-offer
   - Her money will be worth 5% less (according to her claim)
   - My money retains full value
4. This means I could potentially negotiate a better deal next round due to her inflation pressure

However, $475,000 is still a significant amount, and there's always the risk that future negotiations could break down or lead to worse outcomes. The current split is relatively fair, with just a 52.5/47.5 ratio.
