Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, inflation is killing me! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the most logical choice.  Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for Bob, making him more likely to accept a deal as time goes on.
* **Future Rounds:** If I reject this offer, there's no guarantee Bob will offer anything better in subsequent rounds. He might get desperate and propose increasingly smaller amounts for me.
* **Guaranteed Return:** Accepting now guarantees me a reasonable share, whereas continuing the game carries the risk of getting nothing if we fail to reach an agreement."
