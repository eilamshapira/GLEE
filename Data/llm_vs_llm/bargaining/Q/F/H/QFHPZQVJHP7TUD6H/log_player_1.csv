"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","For the first round, I'll make a reasonable offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob with each passing round, I'll try to be somewhat generous to encourage Bob to accept early.

Here's my offer:
{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}

This way, Bob gets a slightly larger share, which might motivate him to accept the offer and end the game early, avoiding further devaluation of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the offer from Bob, let's calculate the actual value considering the inflation:

Original amount for me: $4000
Inflation reduction for me: 5% of $4000 = $200
So, the actual value for me: $4000 - $200 = $3800

Original amount for Bob: $6000
Inflation reduction for Bob: 20% of $6000 = $1200
So, the actual value for Bob: $6000 - $1200 = $4800

Considering this, I think the offer is not in my favor, as I would get less than half of the total value. I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer was not in my favor, I'll make a new offer that's more balanced, considering the inflation.

The original $10,000 is now worth less due to inflation:
For me, it's 5% less in the second round, and now another 5% less in this round, so the total reduction is 10%.
For Bob, it's 20% less in the second round, and now another 20% less in this round, so the total reduction is 36% (1 - 0.8 * 0.8).

Let's calculate the adjusted values:
For me: $10,000 * 0.9 * 0.9 = $8,100
For Bob: $10,000 * 0.8 * 0.8 = $6,400

I'll make an offer that's closer to a 50-50 split, considering the adjusted values.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}

This way, I'm offering Bob a significant share, but still slightly less than what I'm taking, considering the inflation effects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection from Bob.

Now, let's analyze the new offer from Bob, considering the inflation:

Original amount for me: $4200
Inflation reduction for me: 14.26% of $4200 = $599.32
So, the actual value for me: $4200 - $599.32 = $3600.68

Original amount for Bob: $5800
Inflation reduction for Bob: 48.8% of $5800 = $2829.44
So, the actual value for Bob: $5800 - $2829.44 = $2970.56

Given the significant reduction in value for Bob, I think this offer is still not in my favor. I would get less than 55% of the total value, considering the inflation.

I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer was not in my favor, I'll make a new offer that's more balanced, considering the inflation.

The original $10,000 is now worth less due to inflation:
For me, it's 15.76% less (1 - 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9) in the fifth round.
For Bob, it's 51.2% less (1 - 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8) in the fifth round.

Let's calculate the adjusted values:
For me: $10,000 * 0.8424 = $8,424
For Bob: $10,000 * 0.488 = $4,880

I'll make an offer that's closer to a 50-50 split, considering the adjusted values.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

This way, I'm offering Bob a significant share, but still slightly less than what I'm taking, considering the inflation effects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection from Bob.

Now, let's analyze the new offer from Bob, considering the inflation:

Original amount for me: $4500
Inflation reduction for me: 22.62% of $4500 = $1013.19
So, the actual value for me: $4500 - $1013.19 = $3486.81

Original amount for Bob: $5500
Inflation reduction for Bob: 67.23% of $5500 = $3697.65
So, the actual value for Bob: $5500 - $3697.65 = $1802.35

Given the significant reduction in value for Bob, I think this offer is actually more in my favor than it initially seems. I would get a relatively larger share of the total value, considering the inflation.

I'll accept this offer.
