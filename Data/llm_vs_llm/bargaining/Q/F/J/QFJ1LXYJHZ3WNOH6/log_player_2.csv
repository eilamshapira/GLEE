"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share, considering inflation 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, I want to get as much value as possible in the early rounds. Alice's offer gives me $40, which is less than half of the total amount. Considering the inflation, I think I can get a better deal if I wait.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, now it's my turn to make a proposal. I'll try to be reasonable while also considering the inflation.

I'll offer Alice $45 and keep $55 for myself. This way, I'm giving her a bit more than she offered me initially, but still keeping the majority of the value for myself, considering the 20% inflation penalty for me.

{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""More reasonable split, considering our inflation rates""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle, considering our losses 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 36% less for me compared to the first round, I need to consider the actual value I'll be getting. With each passing round, the value of the money decreases significantly for me.

Alice's offer gives me $42, which is more than her initial offer, but I need to consider the decreased value due to inflation. However, if I reject this offer, the value will decrease even further.

Given the significant decrease in value for me and the fact that Alice's offer is relatively closer to a 50-50 split considering the inflation, I think it's a reasonable offer.
