"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an initial offer to Bob, considering the 20% inflation penalty I face each round.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor because with each passing round, the value diminishes for me due to inflation, while Bob faces no such penalty. This is a fair starting point that acknowledges both our positions in this negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to make a more strategic offer considering the inflation penalty I face.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering a slightly more balanced split than my initial proposal. Taking into account that I lose 20% value each round, I'm seeking a fair compromise. This gives Bob a significant portion while still making it worthwhile for me despite the inflation penalty."
