"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully, taking into account the inflation mechanics and the number of rounds we have.

Alice is offering me $400,000 while taking $600,000 for herself. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round. For me, there's no inflation penalty, but for Alice, each round means the money is worth 20% less to her.

This gives me leverage in later rounds. If I reject and we go to round 2, Alice would value the total pot at only $800,000 (due to her 20% inflation).

Given that I have this advantage and can make the next offer if I reject, I believe I can secure a better deal for myself.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice faces 20% inflation per round and I don't, I should offer a deal that recognizes this time pressure on her while being fair enough that she'll accept.

If Alice rejects my offer, we'll move to round 3, where the money will be worth only 80% Ã— 80% = 64% of the original value to her, but still 100% to me. This gives me negotiating leverage.

I'll propose a split that's better for me than Alice's initial offer but still reasonably attractive for her given her inflation pressure.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I'm proposing that I receive $600,000 and Alice receives $400,000. This is a better deal for me than her initial offer, but still provides her with substantial value that will decrease if she delays further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to reassess the situation. We're now in round 3, and Alice has rejected my previous offer.

For Alice, the money is now worth 36% less than in round 1 due to her inflation penalty. This means if she gets $550,000, it's only worth about $352,000 in round 1 value to her (64% of the nominal amount).

She's now offering me $450,000, which is better than her first offer of $400,000.

If I reject, we move to round 4, and I can make the next offer. At that point, Alice's inflation penalty would be even higher (about 49% less value), giving me more leverage.

However, we only have 12 rounds total, and there's risk in continuing to negotiate. Alice seems to be making reasonable counter-offers.

Given the improved offer and the risk of prolonged negotiation, I'll accept this offer.
