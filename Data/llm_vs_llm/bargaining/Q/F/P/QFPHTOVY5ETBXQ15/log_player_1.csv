Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I need to consider the actual value. 
20% of 4500 is 900, so the value I get is 4500 - 900 = 3600.
For Bob, 10% of 5500 is 550, so the value he gets is 5500 - 550 = 4950, but that's his concern, not mine.
Considering this, I don't think 3600 is a good deal for me.
{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each round, and this is the third round, I've already lost 20% + 20% * 0.8 = 36% of its value for me.
For Bob, the money is worth 10% less in each round, so he has lost 10% + 10% * 0.9 = 19% of its value.
Considering this, I should try to get a bit more to compensate for the loss.
