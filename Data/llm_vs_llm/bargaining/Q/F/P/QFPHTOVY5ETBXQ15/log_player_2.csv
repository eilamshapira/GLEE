"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: I get $4000, Alice gets $6000
2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make an offer
   * But money will be worth 10% less to me (and 20% less to Alice)
   * My $4000 would become worth $3600
   * Alice's $6000 would become worth $4800

Since I can make the next offer, and Alice's money devalues faster than mine, I can probably get a better deal by rejecting this and making a counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice's money devalues faster than mine (20% vs 10%), and she knows this, I should be able to negotiate a better split. However, I need to offer her enough so she won't reject and cause both of us to lose more value.

At this point:
- For me, money is worth 90% of original value
- For Alice, money is worth 80% of original value

I'll propose a more balanced split, slightly in my favor:

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

This way:
- I get $5500 (worth $4950 to me after 10% devaluation)
- Alice gets $4500 (worth $3600 to her after 20% devaluation)

This is better than her initial offer for me, and the devaluation pressure should encourage her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

Current offer:
- I get $3500, which after 19% devaluation is worth $2835 to me
- Alice gets $6500, which after 36% devaluation is worth $4160 to her

If I reject:
- Next round I can make an offer
- But money will devalue further:
  - For me: 29% total (another 10%)
  - For Alice: 56% total (another 20%)
  - My $3500 would be worth even less
  - Alice's money would devalue significantly more

Given that:
1. The value is already significantly decreased for both of us
2. Further rejection will lead to even more value destruction
3. Alice has shown she's willing to be aggressive in negotiations
4. My position isn't likely to improve much in the next round

{""decision"": ""accept""}

It's better to take this deal now than risk further devaluation for both parties."
