60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we split it 60-40 in my favor. It's a fair start considering I'm taking the initiative. What do you think?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Alice, I appreciate your initiative. However, with inflation reducing the real value of our money each round, it’s in both our interests to settle sooner rather than later. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor – a fair compromise that acknowledges the cost of delay. What do you say?",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, I understand your point about inflation, but I believe a 55-45 split in your favor is too steep, especially considering the initiative I took in the first round. Let's see if we can find a more balanced solution in the next round.",Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, given the impact of inflation and our previous offers, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor this time. It's a middle ground from our last proposals and reflects the urgency to settle. What do you think?",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
52.0,48.0,"Alice, with every round that passes my share suffers due to inflation – by now it's worth roughly 14% less than in the first round. I understand your desire for a better share, but if we keep delaying, I'll only lose more value. To reach an agreement swiftly and to reflect the urgency on my side, I propose you get $52 and I receive $48. Let's seal the deal now before further erosion of value sets in.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, I agree that further delay will only decrease the value of our shares. Let's go with your proposal of 52-48. It's a fair compromise given the circumstances.",Alice,4,accept
