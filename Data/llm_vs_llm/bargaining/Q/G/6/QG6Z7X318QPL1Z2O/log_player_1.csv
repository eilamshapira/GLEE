Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your initiative. However, with inflation reducing the real value of our money each round, it’s in both our interests to settle sooner rather than later. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor – a fair compromise that acknowledges the cost of delay. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Bob, I understand your point about inflation, but I believe a 55-45 split in your favor is too steep, especially considering the initiative I took in the first round. Let's see if we can find a more balanced solution in the next round.""

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, with every round that passes my share suffers due to inflation – by now it's worth roughly 14% less than in the first round. I understand your desire for a better share, but if we keep delaying, I'll only lose more value. To reach an agreement swiftly and to reflect the urgency on my side, I propose you get $52 and I receive $48. Let's seal the deal now before further erosion of value sets in. 
# Alice gain: 52 
# Bob gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Bob, I agree that further delay will only decrease the value of our shares. Let's go with your proposal of 52-48. It's a fair compromise given the circumstances.""
