"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split it 60-40 in my favor. It's a fair start considering I'm taking the initiative. What do you think?

# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your initiative. However, with inflation reducing the real value of our money each round, it’s in both our interests to settle sooner rather than later. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor – a fair compromise that acknowledges the cost of delay. What do you say?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, given the impact of inflation and our previous offers, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor this time. It's a middle ground from our last proposals and reflects the urgency to settle. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Alice, with every round that passes my share suffers due to inflation – by now it's worth roughly 14% less than in the first round. I understand your desire for a better share, but if we keep delaying, I'll only lose more value. To reach an agreement swiftly and to reflect the urgency on my side, I propose you get $52 and I receive $48. Let's seal the deal now before further erosion of value sets in.""}"
