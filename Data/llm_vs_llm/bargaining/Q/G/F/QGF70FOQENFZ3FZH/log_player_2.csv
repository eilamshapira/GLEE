"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the money 60-40 in my favor. This way, we both get a significant amount, and we can end the game quickly before inflation affects our shares too much. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. This is the first round, so there's no inflation impact yet
2. Alice is offering me $400,000, which is a significant amount
3. If I reject:
   - Next round I can make an offer, but my money will be worth 20% less
   - Even if I propose a better split for me, Alice might reject
   - Each subsequent round reduces our money's value
4. Alice's inflation rate (10%) is lower than mine (20%), so delays hurt me more
5. A 60-40 split isn't terribly unfair given our different inflation rates

While I could try to negotiate for more, the risk of losing value through inflation and the possibility of reaching no agreement makes this a reasonable offer.
