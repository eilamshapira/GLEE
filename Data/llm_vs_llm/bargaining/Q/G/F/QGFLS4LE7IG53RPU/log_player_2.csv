"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which is $500,000 for each of us. However, I need to account for the 5% inflation penalty per round if I reject.

If I reject and make a counteroffer in round 2, the total money will effectively be worth 5% less to me, meaning the $1,000,000 would be worth $950,000 from my perspective. Even if I could get a slightly better split in the next round, the inflation might offset any gains.

Given the fair nature of the initial offer and the certain penalty from inflation, I'll accept this offer.
