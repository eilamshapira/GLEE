"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I'm proposing a fair split where I get 55% and you get 45%. This is reasonable considering we both need to reach an agreement, and time is working against us due to inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it equally. This way, we both get the same amount, and we can avoid the effects of inflation. I rejected your offer because I believe an equal split is more reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The reasoning for accepting:
1. With 10% inflation on my side, $500,000 now is worth $450,000 in round 1 terms
2. Waiting longer will only decrease the value further due to inflation
3. Bob's offer of an equal split is fair and reasonable
4. There's no guarantee that future negotiations would lead to a better outcome for me
5. Accepting now ensures we both get a substantial amount rather than risking getting nothing if we reach round 12"
