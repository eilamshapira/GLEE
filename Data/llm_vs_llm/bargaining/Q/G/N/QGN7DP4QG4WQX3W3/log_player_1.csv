"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less, the actual values would be:
Alice gain: 8000 * 0.8 = 6400
Bob gain: 2000 * 0.8 = 1600

Considering this, I think it's a good deal for me.
