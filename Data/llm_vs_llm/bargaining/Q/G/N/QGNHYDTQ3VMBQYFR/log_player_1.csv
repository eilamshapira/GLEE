"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair offer considering the inflation factor that affects only me.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose we split the money with me getting $55 and you getting $45. This accounts for the 5% inflation penalty I face with each round. A fair split now is better than risking delays that would reduce the value for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I need to account for the inflation penalty that affects only me. Since we're now in round 3, my money will be worth about 10% less than the original value due to inflation. I'm offering you $40, which is still substantial, while giving me $60 to offset the inflation effects I face. This is a fair proposal considering the asymmetric inflation that only impacts me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60
