"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering the time pressure and inflation risk we both face.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation and time pressure, I think a 55-45 split in my favor is more reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept, I'll get $4500, but due to 20% inflation, it's worth $3600 to me
2. If I reject, I can make another offer, but any money I get will be worth even less due to inflation
3. Bob's offer isn't terribly unfair, and the inflation penalty is significant
4. We still have many rounds left, but the value keeps decreasing for me faster than for Bob
