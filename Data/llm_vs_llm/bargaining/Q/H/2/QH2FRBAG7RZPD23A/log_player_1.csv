"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","For my initial offer, I'll propose a fair division but considering that inflation will affect me in future rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose we split the money equally, $50 each. This is a fair division that gives us both the same amount."
