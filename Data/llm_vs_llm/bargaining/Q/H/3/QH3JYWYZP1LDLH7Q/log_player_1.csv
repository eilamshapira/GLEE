"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I'm playing as Alice, I need to make a proposal for dividing the $100 with Bob. I'll consider that inflation affects me more (20% per round) than it affects Bob (10% per round), so there's an incentive to resolve this sooner rather than later.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose an equal split of $50 each. This is fair for both of us, and given the higher inflation rate on my side, it's in my interest to reach an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
