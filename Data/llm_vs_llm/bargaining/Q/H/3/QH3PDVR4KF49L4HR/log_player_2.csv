"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering a 50-50 split, which is fair. However, I need to consider that if I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value will decrease by 5% due to inflation (for me). If I accept now, I get $50. If I wait one round, even if I propose a better split for myself, the total pie would be worth 5% less to me.
