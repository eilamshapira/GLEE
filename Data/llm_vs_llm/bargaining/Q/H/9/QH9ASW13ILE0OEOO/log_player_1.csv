"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. Since I'm the one making the offer this round, it's only fair to have a slight advantage. We both have an incentive to finish this game quickly to minimize inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this... 

Due to 5% inflation, the $4500 offered is actually worth $4275 to me now. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount I receive will be worth another 5% less. Even if I managed to get a better split next round, the inflation would likely eat up the difference.

Bob's offer is reasonable enough, and the cost of delay is significant. Better to accept now than risk further devaluation.
