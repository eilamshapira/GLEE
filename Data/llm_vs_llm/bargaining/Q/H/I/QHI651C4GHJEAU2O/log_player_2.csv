Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think a 55/45 split is fair, considering inflation.  Let's agree to this and move on. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
It's not ideal, but the inflation is a concern. Let's end this."
