"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I want to start with a fair-ish offer, but also account for the potential inflation that will hurt me more with each round.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, this is getting tricky. Bob's money lost more value due to inflation, but his offer is quite low. My money is only worth 5% less so far. I need to consider if I can get a better offer later, balanced against the increasing inflation.

I think I can do better.

```json

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, round 3. Inflation is starting to bite. My money is now worth 10% less than the initial value. I need to make an offer that is attractive to Bob, but also secures a decent amount for myself, considering the diminishing value.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, the inflation is hitting Bob much harder than me, which explains his previous aggressive offer. This offer of 4200 is still quite low considering the 10,000 dollars. However, the relative value of the money he is getting has decreased so much, and that means that he won't probably go much lower, to compensate for that. I'm tempted to take it, but I will try to make a counter-offer

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Alright, round 5. My money is worth 18.6% less now, and Bob's is worth 27.1% less, so he's probably feeling the pressure even more. Let's try to meet in the middle and make an offer that might be hard to refuse, considering the decreasing value and the limited rounds.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4800,
  ""bob_gain"": 5200
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4400 
# Bob gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, round 6. The pressure is mounting. Bob's inflation is much higher, and his offers are only incrementally improving. My inflation is also substantial now. 4400 is not amazing, but considering the circumstances, it might be the best I can get. I'm going to accept.
