Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'll be slightly more flexible.  How about we split it closer to even now? Let's make a deal! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

I'm aiming for a larger share than that, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get it."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Time is ticking, but so is inflation. Let's settle this fairly - this is my final offer.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Alright, alright! Let's split it straight down the middle. It's the fairest way to go, and we can both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

While I'd prefer a slight edge, the effects of inflation are starting to sting.  A 50/50 split is fair and better than risking getting nothing at all."
