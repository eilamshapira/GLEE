"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, but considering the 20% inflation penalty per round if Bob declines, I should aim for a reasonably good deal now.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because:
1. It gives me a slight advantage but is still fairly reasonable
2. If Bob declines, my next opportunity will be worth 20% less
3. The offer is close enough to 50-50 that Bob might accept to avoid inflation effects"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept, I get $450,000 but at 80% value = $360,000 effective value for me
2. If I reject, next round I can make an offer but:
   - The money will be worth another 20% less for me (64% of original value)
   - Any high offer I make might be rejected again
   - Best case in next round would be getting $550,000 Ã— 0.64 = $352,000 effective value

Since accepting now ($360,000 effective value) is better than the best realistic scenario in the next round ($352,000 effective value or less), I should accept.
