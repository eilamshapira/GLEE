"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I'm Alice and making the first offer, I'll consider that Bob faces a 5% depreciation per round. I'll propose a split that gives me a significant portion but is still attractive enough for Bob to accept rather than wait for a worse outcome in the next round.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

This is a fair offer giving you 60% and leaving Bob with a substantial 40% share. If Bob rejects this, in the next round the total value for him will be worth 5% less, making this an attractive immediate option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob offers me $550,000, which is worth full value to me
2. Bob keeps $450,000, which is actually worth $427,500 to him due to 5% inflation
3. If I reject, we go to round 3 where:
   - I can make a new offer
   - Bob's money will be worth another 5% less
   - I might get a better deal, but Bob might reject again

While I could reject and try to get more in the next round, this is actually a reasonable offer that gives me more than half of the money without the risk of further negotiations. The amount offered to me ($550,000) is substantive enough to accept.
