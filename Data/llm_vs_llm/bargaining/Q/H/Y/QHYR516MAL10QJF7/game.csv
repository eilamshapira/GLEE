4100.0,5900.0,"Hi Bob, to avoid further delay (and additional devaluation on my side), I propose we settle now: I receive $4100 while you get $5900. I understand you proposed a 60-40 split earlier, but with every round my share loses 20% of its value. Settling now gives you a secure $5900, and we both avoid the risk of uncertainty in further rounds. Let's finalize this deal promptly.",Alice,3,
