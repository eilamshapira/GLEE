"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 4800, ""bob_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose you receive $5200 and I receive $4800. With each round the money devalues on my side, you'd secure a better deal by accepting this offer now. Looking forward to an early resolution!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation, I propose a 60-40 split. The sooner we agree, the better for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 4100, ""bob_gain"": 5900, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, to avoid further delay (and additional devaluation on my side), I propose we settle now: I receive $4100 while you get $5900. I understand you proposed a 60-40 split earlier, but with every round my share loses 20% of its value. Settling now gives you a secure $5900, and we both avoid the risk of uncertainty in further rounds. Let's finalize this deal promptly.""}"
