"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose you receive $5200 and I receive $4800. With each round the money devalues on my side, you'd secure a better deal by accepting this offer now. Looking forward to an early resolution! 
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, 
""alice_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering the inflation, I propose a 60-40 split. The sooner we agree, the better for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to avoid further delay (and additional devaluation on my side), I propose we settle now: I receive $4100 while you get $5900. I understand you proposed a 60-40 split earlier, but with every round my share loses 20% of its value. Settling now gives you a secure $5900, and we both avoid the risk of uncertainty in further rounds. Let's finalize this deal promptly. 
# Bob gain: 5900 
# Alice gain: 4100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
