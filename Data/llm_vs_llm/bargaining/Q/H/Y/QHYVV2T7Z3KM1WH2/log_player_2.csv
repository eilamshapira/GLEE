"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully given the inflation rates. If I reject, we go to another round where I can make an offer, but the money is worth 10% less to me and 20% less to Alice.

If I reject and we go to round 2:
- The $10,000 would be worth $9,000 to me and $8,000 to Alice
- I would make the next proposal
- I could potentially get more than $4,000

Given that Alice would lose more value (20%) than I would (10%) in the next round, I have some leverage to negotiate a better deal. Alice's current offer gives me 40% of the pot, which isn't very fair.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since we're now in round 2, I'll make a counter-offer that accounts for the inflation and our respective positions.

The total value is now worth 10% less to me and 20% less to Alice due to inflation. This gives me some leverage since Alice will lose more value if we continue to another round.

I'll propose a more equitable split that's better for me than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable enough that Alice should accept rather than moving to round 3 where she would lose another 20% of value.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate this offer considering the current inflation effects.

In this round 3:
- The money is now worth 19% less to me and 36% less to Alice compared to round 1
- Alice is offering me $4,500 (which is $500 more than her initial offer)
- If I reject, we go to round 4 where the inflation would increase further
- In round 4, I would make the offer, but Alice would lose even more value (likely around 50% from initial)

Alice has improved her offer from the initial $4,000 to $4,500. Given the significant inflation Alice is facing (36%), and the fact that she'll face even worse inflation if we continue, this seems like a reasonable compromise. If I reject, I risk Alice rejecting my next offer too, which would reduce the value for both of us.
