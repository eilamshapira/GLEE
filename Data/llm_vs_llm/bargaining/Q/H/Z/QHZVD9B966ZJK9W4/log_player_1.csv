"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. Remember that inflation affects you more (20%) than it affects me (10%), so it's in your interest to accept this round rather than continuing. This gives you a better outcome than waiting for another round. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
