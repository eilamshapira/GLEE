"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split this fairly! I'll take a bit more since I'm making the first offer. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $400,000 while she gets $600,000. If I reject and we go to the next round, the total value will decrease by 10% for me and 20% for Alice due to inflation.

If I reject:
- The $1,000,000 becomes worth $900,000 to me in the next round
- I can make a counter-offer
- Alice would value the money at only $800,000 in the next round

Since I can make a better offer in the next round that would still give Alice a good deal (due to her higher inflation rate), I'll reject this initial offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a proposal that accounts for the inflation rates while being fair to both of us.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. Remember that inflation affects you more (20%) than it affects me (10%), so it's in your interest to accept this round rather than continuing. This gives you a better outcome than waiting for another round.""}"
