"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to think about this offer carefully. Alice is suggesting a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance. However, the inflation rates are different for us - my money loses value faster (20% per round) compared to Alice's 5% per round.

If I reject now and make a counteroffer next round, my money will be worth 20% less, while Alice's will only be worth 5% less. This means I have more incentive to agree quickly than Alice does.

Given the asymmetric inflation and that we're just starting, I think I should try to negotiate a better deal for myself.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a counteroffer that accounts for the different inflation rates we face. Since my money loses value faster (20% per round) than Alice's (5% per round), I should propose a division that compensates for this disadvantage.

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's new offer. She's offering me 52% of the money, which is an improvement from her initial 50-50 split.

Let me analyze the situation:
- We're now in round 3
- My inflation is 20% per round, so my money is already worth 36% less than round 1
- Alice's inflation is 5% per round, so her money is worth 9.75% less than round 1
- If I reject and we go to round 4, my inflation would increase further

Alice has moved from 50-50 to 52-48, showing willingness to negotiate. Given the asymmetric inflation rates that disadvantage me more, and considering we still have many rounds to go but my money is losing value quickly, I think accepting this offer is reasonable.
