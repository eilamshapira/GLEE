Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's make this fair and efficient. I'm offering you a substantial 450k, which is close to half. Quick acceptance means we both walk away with more value due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's keep it simple and fair. We each take half, 500k each. This way, we both gain equally and quickly mitigate inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer of a 50-50 split. While I initially proposed getting slightly more, a fair split is reasonable, and accepting now means I avoid further loss from inflation. With 5% inflation per round, delaying would only reduce the real value of my share, so it's better to accept this fair offer now."
