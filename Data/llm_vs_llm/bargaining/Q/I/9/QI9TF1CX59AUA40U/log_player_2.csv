"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer:

Alice is offering an even 50-50 split of the $1,000,000, which would give me $500,000.

Looking at our inflation rates:
- For me (Bob): 0% inflation per round, so my money keeps its value
- For Alice: 5% inflation per round, so her money loses value over time

Since Alice faces 5% inflation per round and I face no inflation, I have a strategic advantage by going to later rounds. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in Round 2 that gives me more than 50%.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a proposal that accounts for the 5% inflation Alice faces while remaining fair enough that she should accept.

Since Alice faces 5% inflation per round, her $500,000 in round 1 would be worth approximately $475,000 to her in round 2 (500,000 Ã— 0.95). I can use this to create a more favorable split for myself while still giving Alice an incentive to accept rather than go to round 3.

{""bob_gain"": 530000, 
""alice_gain"": 470000}

I propose this split because it gives me more than the 50-50 offer, while still giving Alice close to what her original offer would be worth to her this round. If she rejects, her money will be worth even less in the next round, so this should be acceptable to her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 525000 
# Alice gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze Alice's new offer:

She's offering me $525,000 and keeping $475,000 for herself.

Looking at inflation effects:
- For me (Bob): Still 0% inflation, so $525,000 maintains full value
- For Alice: Now facing 9.75% cumulative inflation in round 3, so her $475,000 is worth about $428,688 in round 1 equivalent value to her

This is interesting. Alice has increased my share from $500,000 to $525,000, which shows she understands the inflation dynamics. However, since I face no inflation, I still have leverage by waiting.

If I reject and we go to round 4, Alice will face even more inflation (approximately 14.26% less than round 1 value). I could potentially get a better deal. However, I need to be careful not to push too far and risk getting nothing if we reach round 12 without agreement.

Since Alice has made a reasonable concession, and the offer is now slightly in my favor, I'll accept.
