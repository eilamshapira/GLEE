"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I want to be fair but also account for the decreasing value of the money over time. Here's my first offer, designed to give Bob a slightly larger share to encourage acceptance early on:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500
}
```

My reasoning:

*   Giving Bob a bit more initially increases the chances of him accepting, avoiding the inflation penalty.
*   I still secure a significant portion for myself in the first round."
