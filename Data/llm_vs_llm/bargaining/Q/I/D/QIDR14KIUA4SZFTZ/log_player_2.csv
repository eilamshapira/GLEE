"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Rationale: This is a fair 50-50 split of the money, which is generally considered an equitable solution in such negotiations. Since there's no inflation affecting my share and there's always the risk of getting a worse deal in future rounds (or getting nothing if we fail to agree within 12 rounds), accepting this fair split in the first round is a rational choice."
