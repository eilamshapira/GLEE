Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given the inflation affecting your share, I propose a slightly larger portion for myself to keep things fair. I hope this seems reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000
