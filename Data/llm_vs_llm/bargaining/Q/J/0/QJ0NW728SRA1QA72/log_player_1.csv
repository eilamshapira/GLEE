"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

This is a reasonable offer that gives Bob a substantial portion while maintaining a small advantage for making the first move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this 50-50 split. While it's worth 10% less due to inflation, it's still a fair offer, and continuing to negotiate could lead to further value loss through inflation. A 450,000$ value (after 10% inflation) is better than risking further rounds of negotiation where we both might end up with nothing."
