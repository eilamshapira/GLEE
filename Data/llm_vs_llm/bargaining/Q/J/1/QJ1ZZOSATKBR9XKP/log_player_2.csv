"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and start with 60-40, I'm open to negotiations 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 
* If I reject, in the next round I can make a counter-offer, but the money will be worth 20% less to me
* Current offer is $40 for me
* In next round, the maximum I could get would be $80 but with 20% inflation, that's worth $64 to me
* However, Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation

While 60-40 split isn't entirely equal, it's a reasonable opening offer. Given the inflation penalty and risk of multiple rounds, I'll accept.
