While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in round 8 is the most logical decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The money is losing value rapidly. Accepting $3,600 now is better than risking getting a worse deal later when the value has further decreased. 
* **Bob's Desperation:** Bob's offers haven't been generous, but he's likely to become increasingly desperate as the rounds progress and he sees the money dwindling.  He may be unwilling to offer anything reasonable in later rounds.

It's a gamble either way, but accepting now cuts potential losses."
