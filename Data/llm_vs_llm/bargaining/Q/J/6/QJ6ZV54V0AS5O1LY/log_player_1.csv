"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","For the first round, I'll make a reasonable offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob with each passing round, I'll try to be fair but also consider the decreasing value.

Here's my offer:
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

This offer gives me 55% of the total amount and Bob 45%. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 595000 
# Bob gain: 405000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I need to consider the actual value I'd receive.

The original amount I'd get is $595,000, but due to the 20% decrease in value, I'd effectively get:
$595,000 * 0.8 = $476,000

Considering this, Bob's offer seems quite generous, giving me almost the same amount I initially proposed, but with the decreased value taken into account.

I think this is a reasonable offer, so:
{""decision"": ""accept""}"
