"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Alice is offering me $40 while taking $60 for herself. While this isn't an equal split, I need to consider that:
1. If I reject, the value will decrease by 10% in the next round
2. I'll get to make the next offer if I reject
3. We have many rounds left, but the decreasing value means earlier agreements are better

$40 is a decent offer - if I reject, in the next round the total pot will effectively be worth $90 to me, making it harder to negotiate a significantly better deal.
