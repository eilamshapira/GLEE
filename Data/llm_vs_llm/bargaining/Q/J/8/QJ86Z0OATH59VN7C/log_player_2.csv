"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me after each round, I'll make a more generous offer to Alice to increase the chances of her accepting it.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value I'd get is 150000 * 0.9025 = 135375. This is a relatively low offer, but I should also think about the next round, where the inflation would further decrease the value for me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth even less for me now (5% less each round, so 14.76% less than in the first round), I'll make a more generous offer to Alice to increase the chances of her accepting it.

{""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""alice_gain"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value I'd get is 200000 * 0.8145 = 162900. This is still a relatively low offer, but I need to weigh it against the risk of further inflation in the next round, which would decrease the value even more.
