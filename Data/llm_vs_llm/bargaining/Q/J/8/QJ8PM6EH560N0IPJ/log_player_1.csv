Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, here's my proposal for Round 2: I take $920000 and you receive $80000. Given our respective discount rates (10% per round for me and 20% for you), if you choose to wait until Round 3 you’d be offering me nearly $900000 to secure your turn as proposer, which would leave you with only about $100000 nominal (worth even less after discounting). In effect, by rejecting this offer you'd only secure an aggregate utility roughly equivalent to $64000 in real terms, while accepting now gives you that same utility without further erosion of the available funds. I believe this is the most reasonable offer considering the time cost for both of us. Please accept. 
# Alice gain: 80000 
# Bob gain: 920000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, in Round 4 the clock is ticking and our shares are further discounted – mine by about 27.1% and yours by 48.8% relative to round 1. If you reject this offer, you'll become the proposer in Round 5, but by then your money is worth only about 40.96% of its initial value. In a fair subgame‐analysis of our remaining rounds, your best alternative as proposer in Round 5 would net you roughly $217000 in present value. My offer gives you $424000 nominal, which at the current discount (51.2% of face value) is exactly about $217000 in real terms. In other words, accepting now gets you the same present value as waiting – without further erosion from inflation. I believe this is a fair and rational division given the circumstances. Please accept. 
# Alice gain: 424000 
# Bob gain: 576000
