Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I take $600000 and you take $400000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the time factor and we're in early rounds. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 920000, ""alice_gain"": 80000, ""message"": ""Alice, here's my proposal for Round 2: I take $920,000 and you receive $80,000. Given our respective discount rates (10% per round for me and 20% for you), if you choose to wait until Round 3 you’d be offering me nearly $900,000 to secure your turn as proposer, which would leave you with only about $100,000 nominal (worth even less after discounting). In effect, by rejecting this offer you'd only secure an aggregate utility roughly equivalent to $64,000 in real terms, while accepting now gives you that same utility without further erosion of the available funds. I believe this is the most reasonable offer considering the time cost for both of us. Please accept.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing $400000 for me and $600000 for you. Considering how quickly the value is dropping for me, this is a better balance for both our needs. Let's make a deal before the value diminishes further. 
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 576000, ""alice_gain"": 424000, ""message"": ""Alice, in Round 4 the clock is ticking and our shares are further discounted – mine by about 27.1% and yours by 48.8% relative to round 1. If you reject this offer, you'll become the proposer in Round 5, but by then your money is worth only about 40.96% of its initial value. In a fair subgame‐analysis of our remaining rounds, your best alternative as proposer in Round 5 would net you roughly $217,000 in present value. My offer gives you $424,000 nominal, which at the current discount (51.2% of face value) is exactly about $217,000 in real terms. In other words, accepting now gets you the same present value as waiting – without further erosion from inflation. I believe this is a fair and rational division given the circumstances. Please accept.""}"
