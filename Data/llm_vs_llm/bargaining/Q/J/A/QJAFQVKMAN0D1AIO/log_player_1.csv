"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it equally. This way, neither of us loses out due to inflation. It's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 10% inflation for me, if I accept this offer:
$50 * 0.9 = $45 effective value for me

If I reject and we go to next round, any money will be worth even less (20% less than original). And there's risk of further rounds and losses.

The equal split is actually reasonable given the inflation pressure, and getting $45 in effective value is not too far from what I initially proposed ($60).
