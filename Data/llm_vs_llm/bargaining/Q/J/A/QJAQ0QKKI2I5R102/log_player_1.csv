"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let me propose a fair split while accounting for the potential inflation penalty if Bob rejects.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose this split because if Bob rejects and we go to the next round, any money I receive will be worth 20% less to me. Therefore, I need to ask for a bit more than a 50-50 split to compensate for this disadvantage. This is still a reasonable offer for Bob, as he gets a substantial portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept this offer of $40, due to 20% inflation, it's actually worth $32 to me
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, any money I get will be worth another 20% less (so 40% less than original value)
3. Bob would likely reject an extreme counter-offer, leading to even more rounds and more inflation for me

Given these factors, while this isn't an ideal split, accepting now is better than risking further devaluation of my share.
