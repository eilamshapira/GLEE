"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer for Round 1 that balances fairness while accounting for my inflation concerns.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing a 55%-45% split in my favor. This is a fair offer that gives you a substantial portion while accounting for the fact that I face 10% inflation each round. If we delay, the total value will decrease for me, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob rejected my first offer and I rejected his counter-offer, I'll adjust my approach to find a middle ground that works for both of us, considering the inflation I'm facing.

{""alice_gain"": 510000, ""bob_gain"": 490000}

I'm proposing a more balanced 51%-49% split. This gives you nearly half of the money while still accounting for the fact that I face 10% inflation each round. Let's reach an agreement now - further delays will only reduce the value for me while you appear unaffected by inflation."
