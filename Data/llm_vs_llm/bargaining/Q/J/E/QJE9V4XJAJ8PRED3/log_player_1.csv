"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $7,000 and you receive $3,000. I believe this division is fair given that delaying the deal further could diminish our returns—especially on my side due to inflation. Let’s settle now and avoid any unnecessary complications!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation impact, I propose a more balanced division. I believe we should share the risk more equally to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I accept your proposal. Given the inflation impact on my share, your offer of $4500 (worth 20% less due to inflation) provides me with an effective value that is better than what I would likely secure by delaying further and proposing in the next round. Let's settle this agreement now.""}"
