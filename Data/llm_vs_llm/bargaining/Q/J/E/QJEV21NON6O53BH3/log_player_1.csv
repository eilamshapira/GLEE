"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly and avoid losses due to inflation!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn, let's be fair but slightly in my favor to account for the risk I'm taking by not accepting your initial offer. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the fact that the money I gain is worth 5% less, I calculate my gain as follows:
4500 * 0.95 = 4275

This is still a significant amount, and I don't want to risk losing more value due to inflation in subsequent rounds.
