"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40 in my favor to account for inflation. It's a fair start. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. In round 1, the money has its full value, and Alice is offering me 400,000$.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2, the money will be worth 20% less to me, meaning I would need to secure at least 500,000$ just to match the current offer's value of 400,000$.

While I might be able to negotiate a better deal, there's also a risk of prolonged negotiations leading to significant value loss due to inflation. Alice's initial offer of 40% is not terrible for a first round.
