"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm proposing a fair split that slightly favors me since I'm affected by 10% inflation each round. If we delay, the total value decreases for me. This is a good deal for both of us - you get a substantial amount and we can both walk away happy without risking everything through delays.

# Alice gain: 550000

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""I appreciate your honesty about the inflation, Alice. However, I believe a more even split would be fair, considering I'm not affected by inflation. Let's meet in the middle and avoid further devaluation of our shares.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but I need to account for the inflation affecting me. Each round we delay, my share loses 10% of its value. I've moved closer to an even split with this offer. If we continue negotiating, we both risk losing everything if we don't reach an agreement within our limited rounds. This is a fair compromise considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000

Since my share doesn't depreciate, I'm willing to take on a bit more risk for a potentially better outcome. Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us, considering the time-sensitive nature of our negotiation.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm now offering a perfectly even 50-50 split, despite the fact that inflation has already reduced my share's value by over 30%. Each round we continue, I lose more and more. With this completely fair split, we can both walk away with substantial amounts and avoid the risk of getting nothing if we run out of rounds. This is my most reasonable offer considering the inflation penalty I'm facing. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
