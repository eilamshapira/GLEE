"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share for both 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has offered a split where I get $40 and she gets $60. While this isn't an even split, I need to consider that if I reject and we go to another round, the money will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation.

If I reject, the total amount would effectively be worth $95 to me in the next round. Even if I propose a more favorable split in the next round, the delay will cost me value.

Given this inflation penalty and the fact that $40 is still a substantial portion of the money, I'll accept this offer.
