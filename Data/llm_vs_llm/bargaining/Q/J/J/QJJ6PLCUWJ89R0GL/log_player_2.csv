"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share, let's end this! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering me 40% of the total while keeping 60% for herself, which I don't think is a fair split. Since I lose less to inflation (5%) than Alice does (10%) per round, I have a strategic advantage in rejecting this offer and making my own proposal next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Alice, considering the inflation effects, this is actually favorable for you. If we go another round, your money will be worth 10% less while mine only 5% less. This is a fair split given our different inflation rates.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is the best I can do. Next round will be worse for me. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer has improved slightly from her initial proposal (40/60 to 43/57), but it's still not as balanced as my previous offer. However, I need to consider the inflation effects carefully.

If I reject this offer:
- Next round I'd be offering again, but my money would be worth about 15% less than the first round
- Alice's money would be worth about 29% less than the first round
- This gives me negotiating leverage, but also means the total value is decreasing

The 43/57 split isn't ideal, but considering the inflation penalties and that we're already in round 3, the diminishing returns of continuing the negotiation might not be worth it.
