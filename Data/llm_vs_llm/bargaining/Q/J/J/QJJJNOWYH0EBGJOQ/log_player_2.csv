"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest we split the money equally. This is fair for both of us, and we can finish the game immediately without risking inflation reducing our gains. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. With a 5% inflation penalty per round, waiting will reduce the value of my share. If I reject and propose in round 2, the $10,000 will effectively be worth $9,500 to me.

While a 50-50 split seems fair at first glance, I could potentially get more by making a counter-offer in round 2. However, if Alice then rejects my counter-offer, we'd continue losing value with each round.

Given the certainty of getting $5,000 now versus the risk of getting less through negotiation with inflation penalties, I'll accept this fair initial offer.
