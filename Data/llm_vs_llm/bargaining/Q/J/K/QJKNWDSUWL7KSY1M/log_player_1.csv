"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split while accounting for potential future inflation if Bob rejects.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I suggest I get $60 and Bob gets $40. This is slightly in my favor but still gives Bob a significant portion. If he rejects, the next round will be worth less to me due to 10% inflation, so this is a reasonable first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
- If I accept now, I get $55, but due to 10% inflation, it's actually worth $49.5 to me
- If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount I get will be worth 20% less due to inflation
- If I offer something too aggressive next round, Bob might reject again, leading to even more value loss

Given these factors, this offer is actually quite reasonable. While it's less than my initial proposal, the inflation effect means I should be more inclined to accept now rather than risk further devaluation.
