"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to think carefully about this game. Since I'm playing as Alice, I want to make a fair offer that Bob will likely accept, while considering the different discount rates we each have.

Since Bob's money depreciates faster than mine (10% vs 5% per round), he has a greater incentive to accept an early offer. However, I shouldn't be too greedy in the first round.

I'll propose a slightly favorable split for myself, but still attractive enough for Bob to consider accepting right away.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Bob's counter-offer carefully:

Bob is offering me $45 while taking $55 for himself. Due to inflation, this $45 is now worth 5% less to me than it would have been in round 1, so it's equivalent to about $42.75 in round 1 value.

If I reject and we go to round 3, the money will depreciate further. Also, if I reject, we enter a potential back-and-forth that could lead to both of us getting less value due to inflation.

Since Bob rejected my initial fair offer and the difference isn't extremely large, I'll accept this offer to avoid further depreciation.
