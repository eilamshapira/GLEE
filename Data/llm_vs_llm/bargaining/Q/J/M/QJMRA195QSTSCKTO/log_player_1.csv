"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair division considering the inflation effect.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose that I (Alice) receive $550,000 and Bob receives $450,000. This slight advantage for me accounts for the 10% inflation penalty I'll face if we go to the next round. A fair split now benefits us both, rather than risking diminishing returns through negotiation delays."
