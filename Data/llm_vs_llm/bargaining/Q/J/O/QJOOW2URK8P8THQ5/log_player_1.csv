"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose we split the $100 evenly at $50 each. Given the inflation rate affects you more, this seems like a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
