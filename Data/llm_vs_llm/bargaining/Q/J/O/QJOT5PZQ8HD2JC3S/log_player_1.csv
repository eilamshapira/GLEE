"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer that takes into account the inflation factor that affects Bob more than me.

{""alice_gain"": 5100, 
""bob_gain"": 4900}

I propose this split because it's close to an equal division while giving me a small advantage. Since you face 5% inflation per round while I face none, you have more incentive to accept a reasonable offer now rather than waiting for future rounds."
