"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
* Alice is offering me $4,900 (49%)
* If I reject, we go to next round where I can make an offer
* However, due to 5% inflation, the money will be worth less to me
* $4,900 in this round > $4,900 * 0.95 = $4,655 in next round

Given that it's a fairly reasonable split close to 50-50, and factoring in the inflation penalty for me in future rounds, I should accept this offer.
