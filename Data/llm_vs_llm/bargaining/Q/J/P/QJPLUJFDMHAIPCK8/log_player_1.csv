Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose an equal split of $5000 each. This seems fair to both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
