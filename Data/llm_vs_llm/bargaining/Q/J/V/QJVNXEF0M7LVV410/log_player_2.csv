My reasoning: I rejected Alice's lowball offer. I'm starting with a proposal that favors me, but still leaves Alice a significant amount. I hope this will encourage her to accept rather than risk further inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 280000 
# Alice gain: 720000

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""alice_gain"": 450000
}
```

Reasoning:

Alice is still offering a very low amount. My previous offer was also rejected. Inflation is starting to become a real problem. I'm slightly reducing my demand compared to my previous offer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a majority. I'm hoping Alice will see that a smaller piece of the pie now is better than a potentially much smaller piece later or nothing at all."
