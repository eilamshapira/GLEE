"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. I'm playing as Alice, and I need to make a proposal to Bob to divide $100. Each round reduces the value of the money, so it's important to reach an agreement quickly. I need to take into account that the money is worth less to me each round than it is to Bob. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

My reasoning: I'm aiming for a slightly larger share initially, recognizing the decreasing value of the money for me as the rounds progress. This gives me a small advantage while still offering Bob a respectable amount to encourage acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 28.57 
# Bob gain: 71.43 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to analyze Bob's offer, taking into account the inflation for both of us.

*   **Alice (me):** The money is worth 20% less than in Round 1.
*   **Bob:** The money is worth 10% less than in Round 1.

Bob's offer is Alice: 28.57, Bob: 71.43.

Let's think about what would happen if I reject. In round 3, the money will be worth 40% less for me and 20% less for Bob. It becomes less likely I will get a good deal at that point.

Given the inflation and Bob's significant advantage in his offer, it's likely my position will only worsen. Accepting secures at least some value.
