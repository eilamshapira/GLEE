"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a reasonable first offer, considering that inflation affects my gains but not Bob's. I want to be fair but also account for my disadvantage.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose $5,500 for me and $4,500 for Bob. I'm asking for slightly more to offset potential inflation if Bob rejects and we go to further rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 10% inflation, if I accept $5000 now, it's actually worth $4500 to me. Meanwhile, Bob's $5000 maintains its full value.

While this is a 50-50 split nominally, due to inflation it's actually less favorable to me than it appears. However, if I reject, we'll move to round 3 where my money will be worth even less (20% less than original value), and there's no guarantee Bob will make a better offer.

Given this, and not wanting to risk further devaluation of my share:
