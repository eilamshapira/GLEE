"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

I propose this split as it's more equitable than Alice's initial offer, while still being generous enough that Alice might accept considering she faces a 20% penalty per round if she rejects."
