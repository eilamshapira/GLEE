"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob, considering the inflation effect on future rounds for me.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a fair split that slightly favors me as the first mover. If we go to the next round, remember the money will be worth less due to inflation, so we're both better off agreeing sooner rather than later.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since you took a larger share in the first round, I'm proposing a reverse split this time. Given the inflation, let's settle this quickly to maximize our gains. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider how the inflation affects both our offers.

In Round 1, my offer would have given me $5,500 at full value and Bob $4,500.

In Round 2, Bob's offer would give me $4,500, but it's worth 10% less to me due to inflation, so the effective value to me is $4,050. Bob would get $5,500, which is worth 20% less to him (so effectively $4,400 for him).

If I reject and we go to Round 3, the inflation will increase further, reducing the value for both of us. Given that the difference between my original offer and what I'd receive now isn't extreme, and further delays would reduce value for both of us, I'll accept.
