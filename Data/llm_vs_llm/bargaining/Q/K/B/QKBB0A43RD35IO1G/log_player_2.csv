"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal for round 1. I’ll take $1000 and offer you $9000. Since waiting only means your share loses 10% of its value each round while mine doesn’t decay, accepting this offer now guarantees you the full value. I believe this is fair given that if you wait to propose in round 2 you could only secure an effective $9000 for yourself. Let’s settle it now and both walk away with a clear outcome. 
# Bob gain: 9000 
# Alice gain: 1000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice's logic seems sound on the surface, but it undervalues Bob's potential future gains. By waiting, Bob can make counter-proposals and leverage the time pressure to his advantage."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 9100, ""alice_gain"": 900, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your opening offer. I understand your logic about the decreasing value, but I think a more even split is fair. I'm proposing $9100 for me and $900 for you. This gives you a small increase from your previous offer while acknowledging that I'm taking on the risk of the value decreasing. Let's make a deal now and avoid further complications.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal for round 3. I suggest that I take $1250 and you receive $8750. Remember, in this round your money is worth 20% less (i.e. only 80% of its face value) if we agree now, which means you'll effectively get 0.8 × 8750 = $7000. If you wait until round 4 to propose, you'll be facing an even steeper discount of 30%, which further diminishes your effective gain. In essence, by accepting now, you secure an effective value comparable to what you could expect later, but without incurring further losses due to inflation. I believe this is a fair way to avoid additional complications and secure our gains promptly. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 8750 
# Alice gain: 1250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is using the same tactic, trying to scare me with the decreasing value.  While it's true the value is decreasing, her offer is still not generous enough. I need to remain firm and aim for a more equitable split, even if it means going to later rounds."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 8200, ""alice_gain"": 1800, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm seeing that you're serious about negotiating, but your offers are still not reflecting the potential losses I face in later rounds. Let's meet in the middle ground – I propose $8200 for me and $1800 for you. This recognizes the time pressure but ensures we both benefit significantly from this deal. What do you say?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in round 5 the situation is getting tougher for you since your share is discounted by about 34.4% (i.e. each dollar you receive is effectively worth only 65.6% of its face value now). If you reject this offer, you’ll get to propose in round 6, but then the pie will be even smaller for you given further discounting (your money will be worth roughly 59.0% of face value then) and I hold all the bargaining power with no discount on my share. With that in mind, I'm offering you a face value of $300 (which is effectively around $300 × 0.6561 ≈ $197 in today’s terms) while I take $9700. I understand it might seem lopsided, but delaying the agreement would only worsen the effective value of your share. I hope you see this as the most rational outcome under our current constraints. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 300 
# Alice gain: 9700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is insulting! Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation. Even though the value is decreasing, accepting such a low amount would be a huge loss. I need to hold my ground and hope she starts making more reasonable offers.  A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, but not when it's a nearly dead bird!"

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 7300, ""alice_gain"": 2700, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand the time pressure, but your last offer was simply unacceptable. Let's be realistic – I'm proposing $7300 for me and $2700 for you. This is a significant amount for both of us, and dragging this out further only hurts us both. Let's close this deal and walk away with a win-win.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, as we step into round 7, I want to highlight that the value of every dollar you receive is only about 53% of its face value now—meaning $100 for you is effectively worth roughly $53 in today’s terms. Given that waiting another round will further reduce the effective value of your share (and your next opportunity to propose will be under even harsher discounting), this offer minimizes your losses relative to further delay. I'm asking you to accept this division—$9900 for me and $100 for you—to avoid additional depreciation. I believe this is a rational deal under the current constraints. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 100 
# Alice gain: 9900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is absurd! Alice is trying to strong-arm me into accepting a pittance.  While the decreasing value is a concern, I'm not going to cave to such a blatantly unfair deal. There's still time, and I believe there's a chance Alice will come to her senses."

Round 8

Let's stop with the games.  I'm proposing $6300 for me and $3700 for you.  This is a fair deal given the circumstances and leaves us both with a reasonable share.  Take it or leave it. "" }"

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here’s my round 9 proposal. By rejecting this deal, you'll get to propose in round 10—but your money will be even more discounted (roughly a 0.387 multiplier in round 10 versus about 0.4305 now). In effect, if you wait, you’d secure an effective value of about 10000 × 0.387 = 3870, whereas accepting my offer gives you 9100 × 0.4305 ≈ 3915 in today’s terms. This slight improvement is all you’d gain by holding out, and it avoids further delays and devaluation. I believe this is the most reasonable split under our current constraints. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 9100 
# Alice gain: 900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is much better than her previous offers and very close to what I would have proposed in this round anyway.  Finally, she's being realistic! Accepting this offer avoids the risk of getting even less in the remaining rounds."
