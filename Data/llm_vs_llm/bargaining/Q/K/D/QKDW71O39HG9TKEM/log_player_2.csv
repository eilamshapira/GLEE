"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: I get $40, Alice gets $60
2. If I reject, we go to next round where:
   * The $100 is worth 20% less to me (value = $80)
   * The $100 is worth 10% less to Alice (value = $90)
   * I get to make the next proposal

While $40 isn't an equal split, rejecting would mean I'm working with a smaller total value in the next round. Even if I propose a more favorable split next time, 20% depreciation is significant.

$40 now is better than potentially getting a larger share of a depreciated amount.
