"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.

Round 3

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since I rejected Bob's offer in Round 2, it's clear he's aiming for a 50/50 split.  Offering anything less than that in Round 3 will likely lead to another rejection, further devaluing the pot. A 50/50 split, while not ideal after my initial offer, is the most logical choice at this point to ensure we both walk away with something."
