60.0,40.0,I propose we split the money with me getting $60 and you getting $40. This seems fair considering the inflation affects me more than you.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
55.0,45.0,"I understand the inflation is in your favor, but your previous offer was too low. Let's meet in the middle.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
58.0,42.0,"Let's compromise. I'll take $58 and you take $42. This way, we both get a fair share considering the inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
50.0,50.0,This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the only fair option considering the inflation will continue to erode the value of this money.  Let's be reasonable and end this.,Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,accept
