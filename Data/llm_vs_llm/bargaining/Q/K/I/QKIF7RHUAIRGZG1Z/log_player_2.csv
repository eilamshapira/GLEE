Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise. I'll take $58 and you take $42. This way, we both get a fair share considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is still getting a much better deal even with the inflation. I need to hold out for a better offer."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the only fair option considering the inflation will continue to erode the value of this money.  Let's be reasonable and end this.""}"
