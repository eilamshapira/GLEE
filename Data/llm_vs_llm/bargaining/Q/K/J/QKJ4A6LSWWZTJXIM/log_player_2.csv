Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I made the first move and took initiative. This is still a very fair offer for you, Bob.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be practical - we've both lost 20% value already due to inflation. I'm proposing a more balanced 52-48 split. If we keep rejecting, we'll both lose more value. This is fair and reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200
