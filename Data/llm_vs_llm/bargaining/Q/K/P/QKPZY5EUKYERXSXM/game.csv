20.0,80.0,"Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $20 and you receive $80. Waiting further will only diminish the value of our money â€” for you by 20% each round and for me by 5%. Accepting this offer now secures your $80 rather than risking a lower effective value in later rounds. Let's settle now for our mutual benefit.",Alice,1,
