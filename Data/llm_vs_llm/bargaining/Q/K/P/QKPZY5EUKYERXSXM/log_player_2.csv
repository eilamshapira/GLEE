"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $20 and you receive $80. Waiting further will only diminish the value of our money â€” for you by 20% each round and for me by 5%. Accepting this offer now secures your $80 rather than risking a lower effective value in later rounds. Let's settle now for our mutual benefit. 
# Bob gain: 80 
# Alice gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Alice's offer gives me $80 and her $20, which is a significant amount for me in the first round, I should consider the potential decrease in value due to inflation.

Given that the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, if I reject this offer, my potential gain in the next round could be significantly less. For instance, if I were to propose a division that gives me the entire $100 in the next round, its value to me would be 20% less, making it worth $80. This is the same amount Alice is offering me now.

Considering this, accepting the offer seems like a reasonable choice to avoid the risk of losing value due to inflation.
