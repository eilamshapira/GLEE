"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make the first proposal to divide the $1,000,000. Since I know that each round reduces the value by 5% for me due to inflation, I'll try to make a fair offer that Bob would likely accept right away.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is fair and equitable for both of us. This way we can both walk away with a significant amount rather than risk losing value through continued negotiations."
