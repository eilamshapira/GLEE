"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth 10% less to me each round. This is round 1, so the money is worth its full value to me. Alice is offering me $45.

If I reject, I'll be making an offer next round, but the money will be worth 10% less. To get the equivalent of $45 now, I'd need to offer Alice $45 / 0.9 = $50 in round 2 for me to get $50.

Alice is only offering me $45 now. I would rather have her money now.
