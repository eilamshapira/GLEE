Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since we both face inflation risks with each round, I propose a more balanced split where I get $55 and you get $45. This is fairer than your initial offer, and accepting now means neither of us loses value to additional inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
