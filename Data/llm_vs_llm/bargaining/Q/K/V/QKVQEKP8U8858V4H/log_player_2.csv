"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose I get $60 and you get $40. This is a fair split considering the inflation risk for me. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether accepting $40 now is better than risking rejection and making a counter-offer in the next round. If I reject, I'll face 5% inflation on any amount I receive.

If I reject and propose in the next round, even if I ask for more, the inflation would reduce my purchasing power. For example, if I managed to get $50 in the next round, after 5% inflation, it would be worth $47.50 to me, which is still better than $40 now.

However, there's a risk that Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation. 

I think I can do better by making a counter-offer, so:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that takes inflation into account while still being reasonable enough that Alice might accept it.

{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, since we both face inflation risks with each round, I propose a more balanced split where I get $55 and you get $45. This is fairer than your initial offer, and accepting now means neither of us loses value to additional inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering the increasing inflation risk for both of us, I propose I get $55 and you get $45. This split helps mitigate the inflation impact for both parties. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate this offer considering the inflation information.

Currently, Alice is offering me $45. With 9.75% inflation from the first round, this $45 is actually worth about $40.61 to me in terms of original value.

If I reject and we go to round 4, I'll face even more inflation (likely around 14.75%). If I were to counter-offer and ask for $55 again, but Alice rejects, then even if I get $55 in round 5, it would be worth significantly less due to compounding inflation.

I notice that Alice has also revealed she faces 19% inflation, which is higher than mine. This suggests she has more pressure to reach an agreement quickly, but she's still asking for more than me.

Given the risk of further inflation eroding the value and the fact that this offer gives me more than the original $40 offer (even accounting for inflation), I'll accept:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
