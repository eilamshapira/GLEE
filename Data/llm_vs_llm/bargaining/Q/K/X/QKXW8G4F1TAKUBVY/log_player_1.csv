"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

Let me explain my proposal to Bob: I suggest a 55-45 split in my favor, as I'm making the first move. This is a fair offer that gives you a substantial portion while accounting for my initiative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While it's slightly less favorable to me than my initial proposal, the 5% inflation means that rejecting and continuing to negotiate would reduce the total value further. A 45% share of $100 with only 5% inflation is better than risking further devaluation through continued negotiation."
