"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

This is a fair 50-50 split, which might seem reasonable at first glance. However, I need to consider that:
1. With inflation, if I reject and wait one round, my purchasing power will decrease by 5%
2. But I'll have the chance to make a counter-offer
3. Alice might be experiencing different inflation rates, which could affect her future decisions

Since this is the first round and the offer is already quite fair, waiting would only reduce my purchasing power. A 5000$ share now is better than potentially getting slightly more later with 5% less value.
