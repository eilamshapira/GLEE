"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate this offer from Alice.

Alice is proposing to give me $4,000 out of the $10,000, while she takes $6,000. This is a 40/60 split in her favor.

While I could accept this and get $4,000, I believe I can negotiate for a more equitable division. Since we have 12 rounds, I have room to make a counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair counter-offer to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I propose we split the money equally, giving each of us $5,000. This is the fairest division and creates equal value for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's new offer.

Alice has improved her offer, now proposing I get $4,500 while she gets $5,500. This is a 45/55 split, which is closer to an equal division than her first offer.

While this is moving in the right direction, I think we can still reach a more equitable arrangement. Since we still have 9 rounds remaining, I'll make another counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a slightly adjusted counter-offer to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200}

I propose I receive $4,800 and Alice receives $5,200. This is very close to an even split while giving Alice a slight advantage. This compromise acknowledges her desire for a bit more than half while still being fair to both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's latest offer.

Alice is now offering me $4,700 while she takes $5,300. This is a 47/53 split, which is quite close to my previous offer of $4,800/$5,200. We're converging toward a similar middle ground.

Given that we're getting closer in our negotiation and this offer is reasonably fair, I'll accept it. Continuing to negotiate for small differences might risk us both getting nothing if we can't reach an agreement within 12 rounds.
