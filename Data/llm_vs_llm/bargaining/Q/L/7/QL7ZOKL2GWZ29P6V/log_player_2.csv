"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m proposing an equal split of $10000 — you get $5000 and I get $5000. This way, we both secure our full share immediately without any delay (and without my share losing value). Let’s agree on fairness from the start! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering a 50-50 split, which is generally considered fair. She's also emphasizing the benefit of securing the money immediately.

Key considerations:
1. The offer gives me $5000, which is a substantial amount
2. There's no inflation impact on my share, so the value won't decrease
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer, but Alice might reject it
4. A 50-50 split is a common fair solution in such negotiations

Given that this is a fair offer and there's no downside to accepting immediately (no inflation on my end), I'll accept this proposal.
