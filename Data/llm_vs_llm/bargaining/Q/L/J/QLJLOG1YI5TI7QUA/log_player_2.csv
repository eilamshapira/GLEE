"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer as it's highly unfavorable to me. I'll make a counter-proposal in the next round, keeping in mind that the total value decreases more quickly for me (20%) than for Alice (5%)."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I propose a fair 50-50 split. This is a reasonable offer that gives us both equal shares, and it's better to reach an agreement quickly since the money loses value faster for me than for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1500 
# Alice gain: 8500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer. Even though Alice increased my share slightly from her first offer, $1500 with 36% inflation is still too low. Given that money is losing value much faster for me (20% per round) compared to Alice (5% per round), we need to reach a more equitable agreement soon, but this offer is still too unfavorable to me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor to compensate for the faster depreciation of value on my side (I've already lost 48.8% value while Alice has only lost 14.3%). This is still a reasonable offer that gives Alice a substantial portion while accounting for the asymmetric inflation rates."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer. While Alice has increased her offer again, $2000 with a 59.04% reduction in value is still far too low. The effective value I would receive is only about $820 in original value terms, while Alice would get about $6520 in original value terms (after accounting for her 18.55% reduction). We need to reach a more balanced agreement, especially considering the severe depreciation rate I'm facing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000}

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor. At this point, my money has lost 67.23% of its value while Alice's has only lost 22.62%. This split helps compensate for the severe depreciation I'm facing. If we don't reach an agreement soon, the continuing asymmetric depreciation will make it increasingly difficult to find a mutually beneficial solution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer. At this point, my $2500 would only be worth about $655 in original value (after 73.79% reduction), while Alice's $7500 would be worth about $5513 in original value (after 26.49% reduction). Despite Alice gradually increasing her offers, the severe depreciation I'm facing means this is still highly unfavorable. We only have 5 rounds left, and the asymmetric depreciation continues to worsen our negotiating position."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 8000, ""alice_gain"": 2000}

I'm proposing an 80-20 split in my favor. At this stage, my money has lost 79.03% of its value while Alice's has only lost 30.17%. This means my $8000 would actually only be worth about $1678 in original value, while Alice's $2000 would be worth about $1397 in original value - making this a much more equitable split than it appears at face value. We only have 4 rounds left, and the asymmetric depreciation is making it crucial to reach an agreement soon."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 33.66% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept this offer. While it might seem low at first glance, given the severe depreciation and limited rounds remaining, it's better to secure something now. My $3000 after 83.22% depreciation is worth about $503 in original value, while Alice's $7000 after 33.66% depreciation is worth about $4644 in original value. If we continue negotiating, my share will become worth even less due to the higher depreciation rate (20% vs 5% per round), and we risk getting nothing if we reach round 12 without agreement. This isn't ideal, but it's better than risking further depreciation or total loss."
