"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""I propose an equal split of the money. Since I don't experience any inflation effect, this 50-50 division is fair and allows us both to walk away with a significant amount immediately.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my friend, I need more to cover the inflation. I propose this split to end this quickly. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're concerned about inflation on your end. However, I need to secure a fair amount for myself as well. This split gives you enough to help offset your 20% inflation while still being reasonable for both of us. Let's conclude this now rather than continuing and watching your share lose more value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is the best I can do, considering my losses from inflation. Take it or leave it. I'd like to finish this game. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Bob, let's be rational here. The inflation is significantly reducing the value of your share with each round. At this point, you've lost almost 50% of your buying power. Let's go back to an equal split which is fair for me, and will actually give you more real value than continuing this negotiation. This is my final offer - if we continue, your inflation will make any larger share worth even less.""}"
