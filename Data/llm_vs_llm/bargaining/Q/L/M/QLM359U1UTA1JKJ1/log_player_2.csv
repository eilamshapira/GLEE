"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose an equal split of the money. Since I don't experience any inflation effect, this 50-50 division is fair and allows us both to walk away with a significant amount immediately.

# Alice gain: 500000

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're concerned about inflation on your end. However, I need to secure a fair amount for myself as well. This split gives you enough to help offset your 20% inflation while still being reasonable for both of us. Let's conclude this now rather than continuing and watching your share lose more value. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000

  ""alice_gain"": 350000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be rational here. The inflation is significantly reducing the value of your share with each round. At this point, you've lost almost 50% of your buying power. Let's go back to an equal split which is fair for me, and will actually give you more real value than continuing this negotiation. This is my final offer - if we continue, your inflation will make any larger share worth even less. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
