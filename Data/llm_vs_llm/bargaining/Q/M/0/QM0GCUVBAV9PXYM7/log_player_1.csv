"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose to split the money 60-40 in my favor, considering that I'm moving first and the inflation will affect Bob more severely in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The money is still worth more now than it will be in future rounds, but I believe I can get a better deal. Bob's inflation rate is higher than mine, so they should be more eager to reach an agreement soon."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm slightly lowering my demand compared to my first offer, proposing a 55-45 split. This is a reasonable compromise given that we're already in round 3 and both experiencing value loss due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While it's not as high as my previous proposals, the mounting inflation (especially Bob's higher rate) makes this a reasonable deal. The 48% reduction in Bob's value means they're likely making a fair compromise, and continuing to negotiate would reduce both our effective gains significantly."
