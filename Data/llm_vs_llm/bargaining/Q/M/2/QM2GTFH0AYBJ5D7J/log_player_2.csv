"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is suggesting we split the $1,000,000 with me getting $400,000 and her getting $600,000. 

I should note that time is on my side in these negotiations since Alice faces a 5% inflation penalty each round while I face no inflation. If I reject and we go to the next round, I can make a counter-offer, and the total amount will still be worth $1,000,000 to me but only $950,000 to Alice.

Given that I have the inflation advantage, I should negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more equitable split given the inflation dynamics at play.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I suggest we split the money with me receiving $550,000 and you receiving $450,000. This is a fair offer considering that time works against you due to the 5% inflation penalty you face per round. With this offer, we can conclude the negotiation now, and you'll receive more value than if we continue to later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice has improved her offer, now proposing I get $450,000 and she gets $550,000.

The inflation factor continues to work in my favor. For Alice, the money is now worth 9.75% less than in round 1, while for me it maintains its full value. If we continue to round 4, her money will be worth even less to her.

Given that I can make another counter-offer in the next round and her position weakens with each passing round, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more favorable split given the continuing inflation that affects Alice's position.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, with me receiving $600,000 and you receiving $400,000. This is a reasonable offer considering that each round reduces the value of your share by 5%. If we continue negotiating further, the total value will diminish significantly for you due to inflation. This offer allows us to conclude now while you still retain substantial value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. Alice is now proposing an even 50-50 split, with each of us getting $500,000.

Alice's position continues to weaken with inflation - her money is now worth 18.55% less than in round 1, while mine maintains full value. This means a 50-50 split actually favors me in terms of effective value.

However, I should also consider that we only have 12 rounds total, and we're already in round 5. While I could reject and counter-offer, I think this is a fair compromise that gives me half of the total amount.
