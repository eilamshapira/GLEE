"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, don't risk losing it all!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a fair 50-50 split. This way we both win equally, and we can avoid the risk of further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation affects Bob's gain, his $5000 is actually worth $4000 to him. Since my gain remains the same, I think I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer is worth less to him due to inflation, I'll try to take advantage of that. Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 7000, 
""bob_gain"": 3000, 
""message"": ""Inflation is eating away at your share, let's end this before it's too late!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair compromise - you get the larger share at 55%, and we can both walk away with a good outcome before inflation erodes the value further. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of Bob's offer to him, considering the inflation. Since the money is worth 48.8% less to Bob, his $4500 is actually worth $4500 * (1 - 0.488) = $2316 to him.

Given that his offer is worth so much less to him, I think I can get a better deal. However, I should also consider that the game will end after 12 rounds, and I don't want to risk getting nothing.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was rejected, and inflation is eating away at his potential gain, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself. Here's my offer for Round 5:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, 
""bob_gain"": 2000, 
""message"": ""Time is running out, and inflation is killing your share - take this or risk getting almost nothing!""}"
