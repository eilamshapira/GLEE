"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, don't risk losing it all! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $4000 out of $10000
2. If I reject, in the next round the money will be worth 20% less to me
3. So in round 2, the maximum I could get would be $8000 but it would be worth only $6400 to me
4. Alice's proposal isn't quite fair (60-40 split in her favor)
5. However, the risk of losing value in future rounds is significant

Since I can make a counter-offer in the next round, and the 20% depreciation isn't too severe yet, I'll reject this offer to try to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split while acknowledging the time pressure we both face.

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. This way we both win equally, and we can avoid the risk of further devaluation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is eating away at your share, let's end this before it's too late! 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:
1. Alice is offering me $3000, which due to 36% inflation is actually worth only $1920 to me
2. She's now asking for a 70-30 split in her favor, which is worse than her first offer
3. If I reject and make a counter-offer, the inflation will increase to 48% in the next round
4. Even if I proposed getting the full $10000 in the next round, it would only be worth $5200 to me due to inflation
5. Alice clearly understands she has leverage due to the inflation only affecting me

This offer is quite poor, but the inflation is severely limiting my negotiating power. Still, I believe I can get a better deal than $1920 effective value, so I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Given the mounting inflation pressure on my side, I need to propose something that Alice will likely accept while still maintaining a reasonable share for myself.

{""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""This is a fair compromise - you get the larger share at 55%, and we can both walk away with a good outcome before inflation erodes the value further.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is running out, and inflation is killing your share - take this or risk getting almost nothing! 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this critical situation:
1. Alice is offering me $2000, which after 59.04% inflation is worth only $819.20 to me
2. The split is now 80-20 in her favor
3. If I reject, inflation will rise to about 67% in the next round
4. Even if I got the full $10000 in the next round, it would be worth only $3300 to me
5. We're already in round 5 of 12, and Alice clearly knows she can wait me out

While this offer is quite poor, the inflation is severely hurting my negotiating position. Each round makes my situation worse, and Alice has no incentive to be more generous. At this point, getting something is better than risking getting nothing or an even more devalued amount.
