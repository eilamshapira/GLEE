"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","For the first round, I'll make a reasonable offer. Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 20% less for Bob with each passing round, I'll try to be somewhat generous to encourage Bob to accept.

Here's my offer:
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

This way, I get 60% of the money, and Bob gets 40%. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is still worth the same, but Bob's offer gives him 60% of the original amount, which is now worth less to him due to inflation, I'll consider this.

However, I think I can get a better deal, so I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Now it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, Bob's share is worth even less to him now. I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself while still being somewhat reasonable.

Here's my offer:
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}

This way, I get 65% of the money, and Bob gets 35%. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's share even more, his offer of 550000 is now worth approximately 48.8% less to him than the original amount. This means the value of his share is decreasing rapidly.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer of 450000 for me is still a bit low. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Now it's my turn again. Since Bob's share is worth even less to him due to inflation, I'll try to make an offer that's favorable to me while still being somewhat reasonable.

Here's my offer:
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

This way, I get 70% of the money, and Bob gets 30%. Given the significant decrease in value for Bob's share, I think this offer is still relatively generous. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's share even more, his offer of an equal split (500000 for each of us) is actually quite favorable to me, considering that his share is worth approximately 67.23% less to him than the original amount.

In this case, I think accepting the offer would be a good idea, as it gives me a significant advantage due to the inflation.
