"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to conclude this quickly to avoid inflation eating into our gains.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to be generous, but I expect a more even split. Let's avoid further inflation losses. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think this through:
* In round 1, my $6000 would have been worth $6000
* Now in round 2, the $4500 offered is worth only $3600 (after 20% reduction)
* If I reject and we go to round 3, any amount I get will be worth 40% less
* Even if I proposed a higher split in my favor next round, I'd lose a lot to inflation

Given the significant impact of inflation and that waiting another round would reduce my gains even further, I should accept this offer despite it being less than my initial proposal.
