"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Using backward induction under the following assumptions, we can “solve” the game. (These numbers come from one standard way to analyze an alternating‐offers game with a finite horizon when each round delays the “real” value of the $10,000 differently for each player.) In our game the following holds:

• In every round if an offer is rejected the value of the must‑be–offered “fallback” is discounted by 20% per round for Alice and by 5% per round for Bob. (That is, if an agreement is reached in round t, then Alice’s money is worth 0.8^(t–1) and Bob’s is worth 0.95^(t–1) of its nominal value.)

• The game lasts at most 12 rounds. (If no agreement is reached by round 12, both get nothing.)

One standard way to “solve” such a game is to work from the last round backward. In round 12 the proposer (here Bob) can keep almost all the money (offering the responder only an arbitrarily small amount) because rejection would lead both to nothing. Working backward one can show that in equilibrium the “minimal acceptable” offers (written in nominal dollars – that is, dollars out of the full $10,000 pot) satisfy a pair of recursive equations:
  • When Alice proposes in round t she must give Bob at least 0.95×[Bob’s equilibrium “gain” in round t+1],
  • When Bob proposes he must give Alice at least 0.8×[Alice’s equilibrium “gain” in round t+1].

A brief outline of the backward‐induction calculation:
 Round 12 (Bob proposes): Bob takes 10,000; Alice gets 0.
 Round 11 (Alice proposes): To induce Bob’s acceptance, she must offer him at least 0.95×10,000 = 9,500. Thus, she keeps 10,000 – 9,500 = 500.
 Round 10 (Bob proposes): He must offer Alice at least 0.8×500 = 400; so he keeps 10,000 – 400 = 9,600.
 Round 9 (Alice proposes): She must offer Bob at least 0.95×9,600 = 9,120; so she keeps 10,000 – 9,120 = 880.
 Round 8 (Bob proposes): He must offer Alice at least 0.8×880 = 704; so he keeps 10,000 – 704 = 9,296.
 Round 7 (Alice proposes): She must offer Bob at least 0.95×9,296 ≈ 8,831.20; so she keeps ≈ 1,168.80.
 Round 6 (Bob proposes): He must offer Alice at least 0.8×1,168.80 ≈ 935.04; so he keeps ≈ 9,064.96.
 Round 5 (Alice proposes): She must offer Bob at least 0.95×9,064.96 ≈ 8,612.71; so she keeps ≈ 1,387.29.
 Round 4 (Bob proposes): He must offer Alice at least 0.8×1,387.29 ≈ 1,109.83; so he keeps ≈ 8,890.17.
 Round 3 (Alice proposes): She must offer Bob at least 0.95×8,890.17 ≈ 8,445.66; so she keeps ≈ 1,554.34.
 Round 2 (Bob proposes): He must offer Alice at least 0.8×1,554.34 ≈ 1,243.47; so he keeps ≈ 8,756.53.
 Round 1 (Alice proposes): Finally, she must offer Bob at least 0.95×(Bob’s equilibrium gain from round 2) ≈ 0.95×8,756.53 ≈ 8,318.75; so she keeps 10,000 – 8,318.75 ≈ 1,681.25.

Thus, in the subgame‐perfect equilibrium of this lengthy game the fair “proposal” in round 1 by Alice is to give Bob about $8,318.75 and keep about $1,681.25 for herself. (The outcome is very lopsided because Bob’s money loses value much more slowly than Alice’s as the rounds pass.)
