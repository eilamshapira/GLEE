"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 8318.75 
# Alice gain: 1681.25 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $8,318.75 (about 83.2%) of the total amount
2. This is a very generous first offer
3. If I reject:
   - The money will be worth 5% less to me in the next round
   - It will be worth 20% less to Alice
   - I could make a counter-offer, but this is already a very good deal

Given that:
- This is a very favorable split for me
- The value will only decrease with time
- There's risk in continuing negotiations
- Alice is already offering me the vast majority of the money
