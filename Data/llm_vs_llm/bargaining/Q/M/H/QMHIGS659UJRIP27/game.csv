345000.0,655000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing that I receive $345000 and you receive $655000. Given our different discount rates (my money loses 10% per round while yours loses only 5%), the gameâ€™s structure gives you a bit more bargaining power if we delay. Accepting this offer in Round 1 ensures both of us get as much value as possible before the pot shrinks. I hope you agree this is a fair and efficient deal.",Alice,1,
