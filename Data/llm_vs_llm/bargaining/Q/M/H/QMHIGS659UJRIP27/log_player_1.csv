"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 345000, ""bob_gain"": 655000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing that I receive $345,000 and you receive $655,000. Given our different discount rates (my money loses 10% per round while yours loses only 5%), the gameâ€™s structure gives you a bit more bargaining power if we delay. Accepting this offer in Round 1 ensures both of us get as much value as possible before the pot shrinks. I hope you agree this is a fair and efficient deal.""}"
