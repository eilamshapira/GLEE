"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think a 50/50 split is truly fair. We both walk away with $5000. If we keep negotiating, we'll both lose money due to the 10% inflation. This way we maximize our combined outcome. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
