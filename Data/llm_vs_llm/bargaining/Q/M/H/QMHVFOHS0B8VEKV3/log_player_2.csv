"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly. I think this is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000, which isn't an equal split. While she mentions fairness, the actual division favors her by $2,000. 

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but we'll lose 10% of the total value (reducing it to $9,000 total). That means even a perfect 50/50 split would give me $4,500 in the next round, which is better than the $4,000 I'm offered now.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equal split while acknowledging the inflation factor.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I think a 50/50 split is truly fair. We both walk away with $5000. If we keep negotiating, we'll both lose money due to the 10% inflation. This way we maximize our combined outcome.""}"
