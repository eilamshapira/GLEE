25.0,75.0,"Alice, every additional round hurts your share by 10%. I’m offering you $25 now, which is worth $22.50 to you in today's value—more than what you’d get if we delay further. Accept this offer and let’s both walk away with our shares.",Bob,2,

40.0,60.0,"Bob, I understand your point about inflation, but I'm still willing to negotiate.  Let's split it 40/60 this time. This offer is closer to your previous proposal, and it gives me a fair chance to get a share that's better than what I'd receive if we continue this game.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
20.0,80.0,"Alice, every round further erodes the value of your share—in round 4, your money is worth roughly 73% of its original value. My offer of $20 to you ensures you secure about $14.6 in first-round value, whereas waiting only drops that value further. Accept this proposal and we both avoid additional losses.",Bob,4,
