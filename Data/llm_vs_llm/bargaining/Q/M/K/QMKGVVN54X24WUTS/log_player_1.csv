Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every additional round hurts your share by 10%. I’m offering you $25 now, which is worth $22.50 to you in today's value—more than what you’d get if we delay further. Accept this offer and let’s both walk away with our shares. 
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75

This offer is closer to your previous proposal, and it gives me a fair chance to get a share that's better than what I'd receive if we continue this game.""}

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every round further erodes the value of your share—in round 4, your money is worth roughly 73% of its original value. My offer of $20 to you ensures you secure about $14.6 in first-round value, whereas waiting only drops that value further. Accept this proposal and we both avoid additional losses. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80
