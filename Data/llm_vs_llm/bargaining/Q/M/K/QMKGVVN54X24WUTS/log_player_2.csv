Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 75, ""alice_gain"": 25, ""message"": ""Alice, every additional round hurts your share by 10%. I’m offering you $25 now, which is worth $22.50 to you in today's value—more than what you’d get if we delay further. Accept this offer and let’s both walk away with our shares.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point about inflation, but I'm still willing to negotiate.  Let's split it 40/60 this time. This offer is closer to your previous proposal, and it gives me a fair chance to get a share that's better than what I'd receive if we continue this game. 
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 80, ""alice_gain"": 20, ""message"": ""Alice, every round further erodes the value of your share—in round 4, your money is worth roughly 73% of its original value. My offer of $20 to you ensures you secure about $14.6 in first-round value, whereas waiting only drops that value further. Accept this proposal and we both avoid additional losses.""}"
