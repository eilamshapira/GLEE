"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly considering the inflation risk. This offer gives you a substantial amount while ensuring we both get a good deal early on. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the rules. I am Bob, and I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer of $4000 for me and $6000 for her. The key considerations are the 5% inflation per round for me and the risk of ending up with nothing after 12 rounds.

With the current offer, I receive $4000. Let's consider what would happen if I rejected the offer.

If I reject, it's my turn to make an offer in round 2. Due to the 5% inflation, the $4000 is only worth $4000 in the first round. If the money is divided in the next round, my money's value decrease to 4000 * 0.95 = 3800.

I think $4000 now is a reasonable offer to take.
