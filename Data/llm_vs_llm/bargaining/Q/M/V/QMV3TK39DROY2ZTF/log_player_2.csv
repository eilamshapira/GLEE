"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $40 while she gets $60. 

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the money will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation. That means the full $100 would only be worth $90 to me in the next round. If I were to get, say, $50 in the next round, it would actually be worth $45 to me.

The $40 offered now is worth more than a potentially higher amount in the next round after inflation. However, I believe I should try to negotiate for a slightly better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair division that accounts for the inflation I'm facing.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing an equal split of the money. This is fair to both of us and provides me with more value than waiting for future rounds where inflation will reduce the money's worth to me. A 50-50 split represents a reasonable compromise between us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate this offer considering the inflation effects.

Alice is now offering me $42, which is better than her initial offer of $40. However, due to the inflation affecting me, this $42 is actually worth only about $34 (42 Ã— 0.81) in terms of original value.

If I reject and we move to round 4, any amount would be worth even less to me due to increasing inflation. The inflation is affecting me more severely than it affects Alice.

Given that Alice only increased her offer slightly and the increasing inflation pressure on my side, accepting this offer seems reasonable. Further delays will likely reduce my effective gain due to the higher inflation rate affecting me.
