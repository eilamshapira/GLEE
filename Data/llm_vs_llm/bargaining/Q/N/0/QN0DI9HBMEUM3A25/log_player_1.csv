"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering we both need to reach an agreement quickly to avoid inflation eating into our gains.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. How about we split it 55-45 in my favor? This is a more equitable split and still leaves you with a significant portion. Let's avoid further losses due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. If I accept this offer now:
   * I get $4,500, but with 5% inflation = $4,275 real value
   * Bob gets $5,500

2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make another offer
   * But my gains will be worth another 5% less
   * Future negotiations might lead to a better deal, but the inflation risk is significant

Given that:
- The difference between my initial offer and Bob's counter-offer isn't huge
- Inflation is eating into my gains with each round
- There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in future rounds
- Bob's offer is reasonable, giving me 45% of the total
