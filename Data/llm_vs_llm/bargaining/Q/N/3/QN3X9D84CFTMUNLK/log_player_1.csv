"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair division of the money to Bob, considering that both of us have equal standing in this negotiation.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm offering a 50-50 split which I believe is fair to both of us. Given that we'd both lose value if we continue to the next round due to the 5% inflation penalty, an equal division now maximizes our collective outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer. While it's slightly in his favor, the 475,000 I'm getting now is better than risking further negotiation rounds. With 5% inflation per round, if I reject and make a counter-offer, we'd lose another 5% of the total value. Even if I could get a more favorable split in the next round, the diminishing total value means I might end up with less in absolute terms. This is a reasonable compromise."
