"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, the money is now worth 20% less to me, so the total amount I'm considering is $100 * 0.8 = $80. I'll make an offer that gives me a bit more than half of this reduced amount.

{""bob_gain"": 45, 
""alice_gain"": 55}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Alice's offer, I'll get $43, but its value to me is reduced by 36% due to inflation. So, the actual value I get is $43 * (1 - 0.36) = $43 * 0.64 = $27.52.

If I reject this offer, the money will be worth even less to me in the next round. Given that Alice's offer gives me $43, which is more than half of what I would consider a fair share after inflation ($50 * 0.64 = $32), I should consider accepting to avoid further loss.
