"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. If I reject, I'll get to make a proposal in the next round, but the money will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation. Each round of rejection leads to further inflation for me.

Alice is offering a 50-50 split, which is $500,000 for each of us. This is a fair starting offer. If I reject and propose something better for me next round, Alice might reject, and we'd continue losing value through inflation.

Given that we have a maximum of 12 rounds and inflation affects me at 5% per round, it's in my interest to reach an agreement relatively early.
