"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable split that gives both of us a substantial amount, while giving me a small advantage as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 20% inflation, the $40 I would get is now worth effectively $32, while Bob's $60 would be worth $48 in original value.

This is significantly worse than my original offer, and the split is too unfavorable to me. I'll reject and try to negotiate a better deal, even though we'll face another 20% inflation in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that we're now in round 3, with 40% total inflation compared to round 1, I need to account for this while still trying to reach a reasonable agreement. I'll propose a more balanced split to increase chances of acceptance, as further delays will hurt both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose an equal 50-50 split. While this will be worth less due to the 40% inflation (effectively $30 each in round 1 value), it's fair and should be acceptable to both parties. Further negotiations would only decrease our total value due to inflation."
