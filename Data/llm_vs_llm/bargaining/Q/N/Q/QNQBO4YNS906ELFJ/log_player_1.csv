"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $600,000 and giving Bob $400,000, with a message suggesting that this is a fair starting point. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's make it a bit more balanced for both of us. How about this offer? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me due to inflation, I need to consider that when evaluating Bob's offer.

Bob's offer gives me $450,000, but due to the 10% inflation, the value of the money I receive is effectively $450,000 * 0.9 = $405,000.

Considering this, I think I can try to get a better deal.

My response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 20% less for me (10% less in Round 2 and another 10% less in Round 3).

To calculate the effective value, I'll multiply the amount by 0.8 (1 - 0.2 inflation).

I'll make an offer that takes into account the decreased value of the money for me. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground, considering the changing values.""
}
```

In this offer, I'm proposing to take $520,000 and give Bob $480,000. The effective value of my share, considering the 20% inflation, would be $520,000 * 0.8 = $416,000. Let's see how Bob responds!"
