"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","While this offer gives me a decent amount, I need to consider the inflation effect and the potential for a better deal. Since this is only round 1, I have an opportunity to make a counter-offer where I might get more, even accounting for the 10% inflation on my next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split that accounts for the 10% inflation I've already experienced.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an equal split of the money. This is fair for both of us and ensures we both walk away with a substantial amount. Since inflation affects my value by 10% each round, it's important we reach an agreement soon. This even split respects both our interests."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice Alice has improved her offer slightly, now offering me $4300 instead of $4000. However, considering the inflation effect, this $4300 is worth about 19% less to me than money in round 1, making it equivalent to about $3483 from round 1's value.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, I'll face further inflation (about 27% less than round 1). I need to weigh if I can realistically get a significantly better deal in later rounds against the guaranteed $4300 now.

Since we're only in round 3 of potentially 12 rounds, and Alice seems willing to negotiate (shown by increasing her offer), I'll try one more round of negotiation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a slightly more favorable offer for Alice while still ensuring I get a reasonable amount considering the ongoing inflation effects.

{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200}

I'm proposing a split where you receive $5200 and I receive $4800. This gives you the majority while still providing me with enough to offset the inflation I'm experiencing. Since inflation is affecting my value more strongly than yours (19% vs 9.75% last round), this compromise acknowledges our different positions while still being fair. Let's reach an agreement soon to maximize value for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice Alice has improved her offer again, now offering me $4500. However, with inflation, this $4500 is worth about 34.39% less to me than money in round 1, making it equivalent to about $2952 from round 1's value.

If I reject and make another counter-offer next round, I'll face even higher inflation. We're now in round 5 of 12, and Alice has shown willingness to gradually improve her offers (from $4000 to $4300 to $4500).

Given that:
1) The inflation is affecting me more severely than Alice
2) We've already gone through nearly half the potential rounds
3) Alice seems committed to keeping the majority share
4) Each round I lose more value due to inflation

I'll accept this offer to avoid further value deterioration.
