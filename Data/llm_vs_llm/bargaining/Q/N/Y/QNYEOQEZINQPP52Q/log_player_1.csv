"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair offer to Bob considering the 20% inflation per round for me.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this division because we both deserve a substantial portion of the money. Since I face 20% inflation with each passing round while Bob doesn't, it makes sense to reach an agreement quickly. This offer gives Bob nearly half of the money while securing a reasonable portion for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to consider the inflation impact carefully for this round. Since the money is now worth 40% less to me than in round 1, I should adjust my offer.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm proposing this split because with the 40% inflation I'm experiencing, I need to secure a larger nominal amount to maintain reasonable value. This still leaves Bob with a significant portion while acknowledging the time-based disadvantage I face. Let's reach an agreement that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to be strategic here. With 60% inflation for me since round 1, time is becoming a significant disadvantage.

{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}

I'm proposing this division because after 60% inflation, I need a higher nominal amount to maintain reasonable value. Bob has been gaining negotiating power with each passing round due to the asymmetric inflation. This offer still provides Bob with a substantial sum while acknowledging my significant time disadvantage. Let's find a solution that ends this negotiation before further inflation erodes the value for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
