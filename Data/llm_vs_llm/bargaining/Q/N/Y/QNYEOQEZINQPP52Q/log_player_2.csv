"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 20% less for Alice in each round, I'll try to take advantage of this.

For round 2, I'll make an offer where I get a bit more than half.

""alice_gain"": 400000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, Alice's offer is not as favorable to her as it seems, since her gain is worth 36% less. 

However, for me, the offer is still a straightforward 400,000, which is less than I was hoping for.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice's offer is worth 36% less to her in round 3, and it will be worth 44.8% less (1 - 0.8 * 0.8) in round 4, I'll try to make an offer that takes this into account.

I'll offer her a bit more than I think she can afford to reject, considering the diminishing value of her share.

{""bob_gain"": 650000, 
""alice_gain"": 350000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, Alice's offer of 650,000 is actually worth significantly less to her, around 41% of the original value (1 - 0.8^4 * 100% = 59.04% less, so 100% - 59.04% = 40.96%).

For me, the offer of 350,000 is still a straightforward amount, but it's a relatively low amount compared to what I could have gotten in earlier rounds.

Given the low value of Alice's offer to me and the fact that the money I gain is still worth the same, I think I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice's offer was rejected, and the money she gains is worth around 64.8% less (1 - 0.8^5) than in the first round, I'll try to make an offer that takes this into account.

I'll offer her a relatively small amount, considering the significantly diminished value of her share.
