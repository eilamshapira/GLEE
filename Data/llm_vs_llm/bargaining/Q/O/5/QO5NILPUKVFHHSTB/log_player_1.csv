"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: How about a 47.5/52.5 split? It's a bit closer to even for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5250 
# Bob gain: 4750 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is still worth the same, but Bob's offer is closer to even, I'll consider it.
