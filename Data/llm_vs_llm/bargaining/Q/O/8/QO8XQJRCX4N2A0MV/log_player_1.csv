"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5263, ""bob_gain"": 4737, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that I take $5263 and you get $4737. This division reflects our future discounting â€” by accepting now, we avoid the 10% depreciation each round. I believe it's a fair move for both of us. Looking forward to your acceptance!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the 10% depreciation, I propose a split of $5500 for me and $4500 for you. This round's offer takes into account the reduced value of money and aims for a quick resolution. Let's settle this now to minimize further loss. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
