"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1, keeping in mind the potential for inflation in later rounds:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm offering Alice (myself) $60 and Bob $40. This gives me a slight advantage, but hopefully not so much that Bob rejects it outright, especially considering the value of the money diminishes with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this offer. Bob is proposing I get $40 and he gets $60.

Considering the inflation:

*   My gain ($40) is worth 10% less than it would have been in Round 1. So, effectively, it's worth $40 * 0.9 = $36 in Round 1 dollars.
*   Bob's gain ($60) is worth 20% less than it would have been in Round 1. So, effectively, it's worth $60 * 0.8 = $48 in Round 1 dollars.

If I reject, the money will further depreciate, and I will need to make an offer that will probably be accepted.

Let's accept.
