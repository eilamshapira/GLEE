3448.0,6552.0,"Hi Bob – let's start fairly. Given that if you reject my offer you’d be the proposer in round 2 (where, because your money only depreciates by 5% per round while mine by 10%, you have a slight advantage), the standard alternating‐offer analysis shows that your reservation value in round 1 is about 65.5% of the $10000. In other words, if you wait you could secure roughly $6552 for yourself, leaving me about $3448. To avoid unnecessary delay and inflation, I propose we agree now to split the money as $3448 for me and $6552 for you. I believe this division reflects both our time‐preferences and the limited rounds we have.",Alice,1,
