9000.0,1000.0,"Let's split this quickly and easily. I get 9000, you get 1000.  Take it or leave it!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Let's be fair and split it more evenly. This way, we both get a good amount. If you reject we both stand to gain less, especially you because of the inflation difference. I'll take a bit more since your offer was not fair",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"Alright, Bob, let's try this again. Inflation is eating away at everything. I'll take 6000, you get 4000. Final offer.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4600.0,5400.0,"Alice, inflation is really cutting into our potential gains. I'm willing to take only a bit more than half to accommodate for that. If we continue, we both lose more. Let's settle this reasonably.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Inflation is killing us. I'm now offering 5500 for me, 4500 for you. Last chance. Take it, or we both get next to nothing.",Alice,5,
