Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Let me propose a fair split that accounts for the time pressure I'm under due to inflation.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the time pressure and the value depreciation, I'm offering you $450000. This is a more balanced split, taking into account your increasing loss. Let's agree on this to avoid further depreciation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While it's not ideal, it's a reasonable compromise given that waiting another round would reduce my purchasing power by another 20%. The $450,000 I get now is worth more than potentially getting a larger nominal amount in future rounds due to the inflation penalty. It's a fair enough deal to conclude the negotiation."
