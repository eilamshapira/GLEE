"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a solid $400000. Since I lose 20% value each round, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. This is a fair split considering the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Alice's offer gives me $400,000 and she gets $600,000, I should consider whether this is a good deal for me, especially given the time pressure and the fact that the money loses value for both of us over time, but more significantly for Alice.

Given that this is the first round and I have the opportunity to make a counteroffer in the next round, I should think about whether I can get a better deal. However, Alice's point about losing 20% value each round is significant, and it does put pressure on both of us to agree sooner rather than later.

Considering these factors, my initial instinct might be to reject the offer, hoping to negotiate a better split in the next round. But, I also need to consider the risk of not reaching an agreement within the 12 rounds, which would result in both of us getting nothing.

For now, I think I will reject the offer, hoping to negotiate a more favorable split in the next round, taking into account the decreasing value of the money for Alice.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Now it's my turn to make an offer. Considering Alice loses 20% of the value each round, and I want to take advantage of this to negotiate a better deal, I'll make an offer that is somewhat favorable to me but still reasonable enough for Alice to consider, given her increasing loss.

My offer will be to give Alice $450,000 and keep $550,000 for myself. This offer is slightly more generous than Alice's initial offer to me but still reflects the advantage I have due to the value depreciation.

Here's my offer in the required format:

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, considering the time pressure and the value depreciation, I'm offering you $450,000. This is a more balanced split, taking into account your increasing loss. Let's agree on this to avoid further depreciation.""}"
