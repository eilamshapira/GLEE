600000.0,400000.0,I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to avoid the 20% inflation penalty from further rounds.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
500000.0,500000.0,I propose a 50-50 split which is perfectly fair to both of us. I rejected your first offer because the 60-40 split favored you too heavily. This even split allows us both to avoid any further inflation penalties. Let's conclude this deal now and both walk away with $500000.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,accept
