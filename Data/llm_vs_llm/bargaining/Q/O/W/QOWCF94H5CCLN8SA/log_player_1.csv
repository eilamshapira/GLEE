"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 50-50 split which is perfectly fair to both of us. I rejected your first offer because the 60-40 split favored you too heavily. This even split allows us both to avoid any further inflation penalties. Let's conclude this deal now and both walk away with $500000. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Due to 20% inflation for me, $500,000 is now only worth $400,000 in round 1 terms
2. Another round would mean even more severe inflation
3. Bob's initial rejection of my 60-40 split suggests he's willing to negotiate hard
4. A 50-50 split is objectively fair, but due to the asymmetric inflation, it's actually disadvantageous for me
5. However, risking another round could lead to an even worse outcome

{""decision"": ""accept""}

While this isn't ideal due to the inflation effect, accepting now prevents further value erosion, and Bob seems unlikely to offer better terms."
