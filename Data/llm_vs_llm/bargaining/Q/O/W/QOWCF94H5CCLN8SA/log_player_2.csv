"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to avoid the 20% inflation penalty from further rounds. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing I get $400,000 while she gets $600,000.

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation. That means the $1,000,000 total would effectively be worth $950,000 to me in the next round.

If I accept now, I get $400,000. If I reject and try to negotiate for more next round, I'd need to secure more than $421,053 (which is $400,000 รท 0.95) to come out ahead after accounting for my 5% inflation penalty.

Given that Alice has mentioned a ""20% inflation penalty"" which is incorrect (it's 5% for me), and I don't know Alice's inflation rate, I'll reject this offer and make my own proposal next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced offer that acknowledges the inflation risk while being fair to both of us.

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""I propose a 50-50 split which is perfectly fair to both of us. I rejected your first offer because the 60-40 split favored you too heavily. This even split allows us both to avoid any further inflation penalties. Let's conclude this deal now and both walk away with $500,000.""}"
