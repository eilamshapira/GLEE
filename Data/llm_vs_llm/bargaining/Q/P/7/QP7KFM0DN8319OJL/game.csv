55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest we split the money fairly with me taking $55 and you taking $45. This is fair considering the inflation rates - mine is 5% while yours is 10%. If we delay, we both lose value, so it makes sense to agree quickly. This offer gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging our different inflation rates.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"Alice, I think we can find a better split that accounts for our individual inflation rates. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, which is a more equitable reflection of our respective financial losses. Let's work together to reach a fair agreement.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
50.0,50.0,"Bob, let's be fair and split this 50/50. While I understand we have different inflation rates, a perfectly equal split is the most objectively fair solution. If we keep rejecting offers, we both lose more value - you're already down 19% from your original value and I'm down 10%. Let's not waste more time and money. This even split respects both of us equally.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
35.0,65.0,"Alice, I understand your desire for a fair split, but I'm still concerned about the disproportionate impact of inflation on my share.  I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but a 65/35 split is the best I can do while still acknowledging our differing inflation rates. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
48.0,52.0,"Bob, we need to reach an agreement soon. I'm offering you the larger share at 52% to acknowledge your higher inflation rate, which is fair. If we continue this back-and-forth, we'll both lose significantly more value - you've already lost over 34% to inflation while I've lost about 19%. This is my final reasonable offer considering our situation. Further delay only hurts us both disproportionately.",Alice,5,
