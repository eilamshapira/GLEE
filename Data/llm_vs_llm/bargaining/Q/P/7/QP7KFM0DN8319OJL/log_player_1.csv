"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest we split the money fairly with me taking $55 and you taking $45. This is fair considering the inflation rates - mine is 5% while yours is 10%. If we delay, we both lose value, so it makes sense to agree quickly. This offer gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging our different inflation rates.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I think we can find a better split that accounts for our individual inflation rates. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, which is a more equitable reflection of our respective financial losses. Let's work together to reach a fair agreement. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Bob, let's be fair and split this 50/50. While I understand we have different inflation rates, a perfectly equal split is the most objectively fair solution. If we keep rejecting offers, we both lose more value - you're already down 19% from your original value and I'm down 10%. Let's not waste more time and money. This even split respects both of us equally.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire for a fair split, but I'm still concerned about the disproportionate impact of inflation on my share.  I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but a 65/35 split is the best I can do while still acknowledging our differing inflation rates. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 48, 
""bob_gain"": 52, 
""message"": ""Bob, we need to reach an agreement soon. I'm offering you the larger share at 52% to acknowledge your higher inflation rate, which is fair. If we continue this back-and-forth, we'll both lose significantly more value - you've already lost over 34% to inflation while I've lost about 19%. This is my final reasonable offer considering our situation. Further delay only hurts us both disproportionately.""}"
