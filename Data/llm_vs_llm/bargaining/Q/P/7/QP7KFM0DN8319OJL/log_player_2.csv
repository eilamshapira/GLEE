"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest we split the money fairly with me taking $55 and you taking $45. This is fair considering the inflation rates - mine is 5% while yours is 10%. If we delay, we both lose value, so it makes sense to agree quickly. This offer gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging our different inflation rates. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, I think we can find a better split that accounts for our individual inflation rates. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, which is a more equitable reflection of our respective financial losses. Let's work together to reach a fair agreement.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be fair and split this 50/50. While I understand we have different inflation rates, a perfectly equal split is the most objectively fair solution. If we keep rejecting offers, we both lose more value - you're already down 19% from your original value and I'm down 10%. Let's not waste more time and money. This even split respects both of us equally. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50

{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your desire for a fair split, but I'm still concerned about the disproportionate impact of inflation on my share.  I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but a 65/35 split is the best I can do while still acknowledging our differing inflation rates. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we need to reach an agreement soon. I'm offering you the larger share at 52% to acknowledge your higher inflation rate, which is fair. If we continue this back-and-forth, we'll both lose significantly more value - you've already lost over 34% to inflation while I've lost about 19%. This is my final reasonable offer considering our situation. Further delay only hurts us both disproportionately. 
# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48
