Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I propose a fair split with a slight advantage for me as the first mover. This way we both get a substantial amount without risking inflation losses.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was tempting, but let's be realistic. I'm proposing a slightly better deal for me to reflect the risk I'm taking by letting the money depreciate.  This way we both still get a significant sum. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While it's slightly less favorable than my initial proposal, the 5% inflation makes it wise to secure the deal now rather than risk further depreciation. Getting $475,000 now is better than potentially getting less in future rounds or nothing at all if we can't reach an agreement within the 12 rounds."
