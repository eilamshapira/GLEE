Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but the instructions state that inflation is 0% for me, so I'm not affected by it. Let's start with an equal 50-50 split which is fair for both of us. This way we can conclude the negotiation quickly and both benefit equally.

# Bob gain: 500000
