"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer. I take a bit more considering the inflation risk. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer from Alice.

Alice is proposing a 600,000/400,000 split in her favor, justifying it with ""inflation risk."" However, the instructions state that inflation doesn't affect me (0% inflation for Bob), so I shouldn't be overly concerned about that factor.

Since this is the first round and I have the opportunity to make a counter-offer if I reject, I believe I can propose a more favorable split for myself. As we progress through rounds, we might need to compromise, but starting with accepting a 40% share when inflation doesn't affect me doesn't seem optimal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more balanced while acknowledging Alice's concerns.

```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but the instructions state that inflation is 0% for me, so I'm not affected by it. Let's start with an equal 50-50 split which is fair for both of us. This way we can conclude the negotiation quickly and both benefit equally.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the offer, but I need a bit more security upfront due to the inflation working against me.  This offer still gets us a good split. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Alice has rejected my 50-50 split and is now revealing that inflation is affecting her significantly - her money is worth 36% less than in round 1. This provides important context I didn't have before.

Alice is now offering me 450,000 while taking 550,000. Considering that:
1. Inflation doesn't affect me (still 0%)
2. Inflation is affecting Alice (36% less value in round 3)
3. We have 9 more rounds left, but inflation will continue to affect Alice
4. Alice's current offer gives me 45% of the total, which is better than her first offer

This seems like a reasonable compromise given the asymmetric inflation effects. If I reject, inflation will hurt Alice even more in the next round, which might lead to a worse overall outcome for both of us.
