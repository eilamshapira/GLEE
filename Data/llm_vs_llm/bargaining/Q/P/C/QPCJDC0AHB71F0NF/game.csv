600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, in order to avoid any potential losses from inflation as rounds pass, I'm proposing an immediate split: you get $400000 and I keep $600000. I believe this is a fair offer given the time-sensitivity of the game, and I hope you'll accept to help us both secure our share as soon as possible.",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your concern about inflation, but I think your initial offer was a bit one-sided. Considering we both want to avoid losses, I'm proposing a more balanced split. Let's divide the money in a way that gives me $550000 and you $450000. This way, we both get a significant share, and we can end the game before inflation takes its toll.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your effort, but I'm going to reject this offer. Given that my share doesn't depreciate while yours does, I believe that waiting a round will allow me to propose a division that reflects these dynamics more fairly. Let's continue, and I look forward to our next round of proposals.",Alice,2,reject
700000.0,300000.0,"Hi Bob, I understand you weren’t satisfied with the previous splits. In this round, consider that any delay further will cost you even more due to inflation – your share loses 20% of its value now if we agree today, and even more in later rounds. With this in mind, I propose a split where I receive $700000 and you receive $300000. While this may look uneven nominally, your $300000 in round 3 effectively amounts to $240000 in first–round value. If you wait to propose in round 4, you risk an even steeper devaluation. I believe this offer, though it favors me, gives you a better chance than risking future rounds where the inflation penalty on your share will only worsen. Let’s settle now before further losses accumulate.",Alice,3,

420000.0,580000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your candor about the inflation impact, but I still think your offer is too skewed in your favor. Given the situation, I'm willing to take a risk and propose a split that gives me $580000 and you $420000. Considering the inflation, my actual gain will be lower, but I believe this is a more reasonable division. Let's settle on this before further losses accumulate.",Bob,4,
,,"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. When translating your proposal into first‐round equivalent values, your $580000 effectively equates to about $423000 due to the 27.1% inflation penalty, while my share remains $420000. This nearly balanced outcome, under the current conditions, minimizes further risk from inflation. I accept your offer.",Alice,4,accept
