"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in order to avoid any potential losses from inflation as rounds pass, I'm proposing an immediate split: you get $400000 and I keep $600000. I believe this is a fair offer given the time-sensitivity of the game, and I hope you'll accept to help us both secure our share as soon as possible. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your concern about inflation, but I think your initial offer was a bit one-sided. Considering we both want to avoid losses, I'm proposing a more balanced split. Let's divide the money in a way that gives me $550,000 and you $450,000. This way, we both get a significant share, and we can end the game before inflation takes its toll.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you weren’t satisfied with the previous splits. In this round, consider that any delay further will cost you even more due to inflation – your share loses 20% of its value now if we agree today, and even more in later rounds. With this in mind, I propose a split where I receive $700000 and you receive $300000. While this may look uneven nominally, your $300000 in round 3 effectively amounts to $240000 in first–round value. If you wait to propose in round 4, you risk an even steeper devaluation. I believe this offer, though it favors me, gives you a better chance than risking future rounds where the inflation penalty on your share will only worsen. Let’s settle now before further losses accumulate. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 580000, 
""alice_gain"": 420000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your candor about the inflation impact, but I still think your offer is too skewed in your favor. Given the situation, I'm willing to take a risk and propose a split that gives me $580,000 and you $420,000. Considering the inflation, my actual gain will be lower, but I believe this is a more reasonable division. Let's settle on this before further losses accumulate.""}"
