"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose an equal split of $10000 - $5000 each. Let's settle now to avoid any delay and additional inflation effects. I look forward to your agreement! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split ($5000 each)
2. If I reject, I'll get to make a counter-offer, but:
   - The money will be worth 5% less to me (only $9500 total value)
   - My maximum potential gain would be less than $9500
3. A $5000 gain now is fair and reasonable
4. Rejecting would mean risking value due to inflation with no guarantee of a better outcome
