"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the first round's proposal and the impending inflation, I suggest a 55-45 split in my favor. This is a fair compromise considering the reduced value of the total sum. Let's settle this quickly to minimize our losses. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The reason I accept is that due to inflation, if we continue to the next round, the money will be worth another 20% less. Bob's offer of 4500 now is better than trying to get more in the next round when everything will be worth less. This is a reasonable compromise and it's best to conclude the negotiation now."
