0.0,10000.0,"Hi Bob, here's my honest offer. I’m aware that as rounds progress my share will shrink by 20% per round while your money keeps its value. To avoid any delay—and since you can secure the full $10000 by waiting—I propose we settle immediately: you get $10000 and I take nothing. I hope you recognize that accepting now is just as good for you as holding out later.",Alice,1,

1000.0,9000.0,"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm not interested in taking all the money. I think it's fair to offer you some of the money, especially since your share depreciates more quickly than mine. This offer is a good starting point, let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",Bob,2,
