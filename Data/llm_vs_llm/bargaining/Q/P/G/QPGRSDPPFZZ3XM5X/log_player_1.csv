"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 0, ""bob_gain"": 10000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my honest offer. I’m aware that as rounds progress my share will shrink by 20% per round while your money keeps its value. To avoid any delay—and since you can secure the full $10,000 by waiting—I propose we settle immediately: you get $10,000 and I take nothing. I hope you recognize that accepting now is just as good for you as holding out later.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm not interested in taking all the money. I think it's fair to offer you some of the money, especially since your share depreciates more quickly than mine. This offer is a good starting point, let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
