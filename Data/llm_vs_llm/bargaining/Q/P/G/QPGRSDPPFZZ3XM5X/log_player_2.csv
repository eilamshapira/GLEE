"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my honest offer. I’m aware that as rounds progress my share will shrink by 20% per round while your money keeps its value. To avoid any delay—and since you can secure the full $10000 by waiting—I propose we settle immediately: you get $10000 and I take nothing. I hope you recognize that accepting now is just as good for you as holding out later. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 9000, ""alice_gain"": 1000, ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm not interested in taking all the money. I think it's fair to offer you some of the money, especially since your share depreciates more quickly than mine. This offer is a good starting point, let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.""}
