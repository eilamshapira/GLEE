"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to make a strategic offer that accounts for the differing inflation rates that Alice and Bob face. Since my money devalues faster (10% per round vs Bob's 5%), I have a stronger incentive to reach an agreement quickly.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose that I receive $550,000 and Bob receives $450,000. This is slightly in my favor but still gives Bob a substantial portion. Given that my inflation rate is higher than Bob's, this early offer is quite reasonable, as waiting would hurt me more than it hurts him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 310000 
# Bob gain: 690000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer since it's heavily skewed in Bob's favor. While I do face higher inflation (10% vs 5%), this division gives Bob more than twice what I would receive, which is too unbalanced given we're only in round 2."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to adjust my offer to be more enticing while still securing a fair share, considering our different inflation rates.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose an even 50-50 split of the $1,000,000. This is a completely fair division that acknowledges we both deserve an equal share. Since my inflation rate is higher (10% vs 5%), I'm showing good faith with this balanced proposal while also recognizing we should reach an agreement soon before more value is lost to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 144400 
# Bob gain: 855600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer. Bob's proposal is extremely unfair, offering me only about 14.4% of the total amount while taking over 85% for himself. Even accounting for the different inflation rates, this division is too imbalanced to accept. We still have several rounds remaining to reach a more equitable agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to be more strategic considering we're now in round 5 and the inflation rates are significantly impacting both of us, though more severely for me.

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}

I propose that I receive $450,000 and Bob receives $550,000. This acknowledges the advantage Bob has with the lower inflation rate while still ensuring I receive a significant portion. We're now approaching the midpoint of our negotiation, and it's becoming increasingly important to reach an agreement before inflation further erodes our potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 116100 
# Bob gain: 883900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer. Despite the increasing inflation pressure, Bob's proposal of only $116,100 for me (less than 12% of the total) while taking $883,900 for himself is still extremely unfair. The difference in our inflation rates doesn't justify such a severely imbalanced division. We still have several rounds remaining to find a more equitable solution."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to make a more conciliatory offer given we're now in round 7 and the inflation is seriously affecting both of our potential gains.

{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}

I propose that I receive $400,000 and Bob receives $600,000. This offer acknowledges Bob's stronger position due to the lower inflation rate he faces, while still ensuring I receive a reasonable share. At this point, we've passed the halfway mark of our negotiation window, and reaching an agreement soon is becoming critical before inflation further diminishes our potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 83475 
# Bob gain: 916525 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer. Even with the significant inflation impact, Bob's proposal giving me only around 8.3% of the total amount is unreasonably low. While I understand my bargaining position weakens with each round due to our different inflation rates, this division is still far too skewed. We still have 4 rounds remaining to find a more reasonable compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given we're now in round 9 with only a few rounds remaining and significant inflation has already occurred, I need to make a more substantial concession.

{""alice_gain"": 350000, ""bob_gain"": 650000}

I propose that I receive $350,000 and Bob receives $650,000. This offer acknowledges Bob's increasingly stronger position due to our different inflation rates while still securing a meaningful portion for myself. With just a few rounds left and the threat of both of us receiving nothing, I'm making this substantial concession to encourage an agreement before time runs out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 36.98% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45000 
# Bob gain: 955000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer. Despite the significant inflation impact and only two rounds remaining, Bob's proposal giving me just 4.5% of the total amount is still extremely unfair. Even accounting for our different inflation rates, this division doesn't represent a reasonable compromise. I'll take my chances with the remaining rounds to reach a more equitable solution."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","We're now in the penultimate round with significant inflation already affecting both of us. I need to make a final strategic offer that has a real chance of being accepted.

{""alice_gain"": 250000, ""bob_gain"": 750000}

I propose that I receive $250,000 and Bob receives $750,000. This offer significantly favors Bob, acknowledging the stronger position he has due to our different inflation rates and the fact that we're almost out of negotiation time. With only one round remaining after this, I'm making this substantial concession to avoid the scenario where we both get nothing. This division still gives me a meaningful amount while giving Bob an excellent deal that would be risky to reject with just one round left."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 68.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 43.12% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer. While we're in the final round and face the prospect of getting nothing, Bob's offer of just $1 to me is essentially the same as getting nothing. This is an insulting proposal that doesn't represent any meaningful attempt at compromise. Since we've reached the last round without agreement, we'll both receive nothing, but I cannot accept such an extremely unfair division on principle."
