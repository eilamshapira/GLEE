"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, considering the inflation risk for me. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
1. She's offering me $4,500 out of $10,000
2. She's asking for $5,500, citing inflation risk on her side
3. While this isn't a 50-50 split, it's reasonably close (45-55)
4. I know inflation won't affect my share, but I don't know how it affects Alice
5. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer, but that delays the resolution
6. There's a risk of getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds

Given that this is a decent offer in the first round and there's no inflation risk for me, I'll accept it. Getting $4,500 for sure is better than risking a longer negotiation that might lead to nothing.
