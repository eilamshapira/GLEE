"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a slightly favorable split for myself since I'm making the first offer, but still fair enough that Bob might accept to avoid inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose you (Bob) get $450,000, and I get $550,000. This is a reasonable split that gives us both substantial amounts, and accepting now means avoiding the 5% inflation penalty in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept now, I get $450,000 Ã— 0.95 = $427,500 in effective value
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer, any amount I get will be worth another 5% less
3. Given that Bob didn't accept my first reasonable offer and now wants more, it's unlikely they'll accept a better offer from me in the next round
4. $427,500 is still a significant amount, and continuing the game risks further value loss
