"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice offered me $40 out of $100, keeping $60 for herself. If I reject this:
- I can make a counter-offer in the next round
- For me, the money will still be worth the same ($100)
- For Alice, the money will be worth 20% less ($80)

This means in the next round, if I offer Alice $50, it would be worth $40 to her (due to the 20% devaluation), and I could keep $50 for myself. This would be better than accepting $40 now, and Alice would likely accept since it's equivalent to what she'd get now after accounting for inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that the money is now worth 20% less to Alice but the same to me, I can make a strategic offer that's better for me while still being acceptable to Alice.

I'll offer:

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

This division is fair in real value terms because:
- For me: I get $50 at full value
- For Alice: She gets $50, but due to 20% devaluation it's worth $40 to her
This is equivalent to her previous offer's real value to her, so she should accept it, while I get a better deal than her initial offer."
