"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make my first offer to Bob, considering the game dynamics and the inflation rates.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that slightly favors me as the first mover. If you reject, remember that inflation will reduce the total value by 10% for me and 5% for you, meaning we both lose in absolute terms. This offer gives you a substantial portion while recognizing my first-mover position.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation impact is heavier on you, I propose a split that slightly favors me but still gives you a significant share. This offer reflects a fair adjustment given our different inflation rates. Let's settle this round to avoid further value loss. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze Bob's offer considering the inflation rates.

If I reject, we move to round 3 where I can make an offer, but the money will be worth 20% less to me and 10% less to Bob compared to round 1.

Bob is offering me $475,000, which after 10% inflation is worth $427,500 in round 1 terms to me. If I reject and we continue, any future agreement would be on money that's worth even less.

This is actually a reasonable offer given the inflation asymmetry. If I reject, I'd need to secure significantly more in the next round to overcome the additional 10% inflation I'll face.
