"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that slightly favors me as the first mover. If you reject, remember that inflation will reduce the total value by 10% for me and 5% for you, meaning we both lose in absolute terms. This offer gives you a substantial portion while recognizing my first-mover position. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
