"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer to divide the $100. Since I'm considering the 5% inflation for myself each round, I'll aim for a fair but slightly advantageous split for me.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose this split because it's reasonably balanced while giving me a slight advantage. If Bob rejects and we move to the next round, my money will be worth less due to inflation, so I'm incentivized to reach an agreement sooner rather than later."
