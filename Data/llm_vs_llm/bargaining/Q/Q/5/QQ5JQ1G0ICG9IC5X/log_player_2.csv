"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully, especially given the 20% inflation penalty per round.

Alice is offering me $45 out of $100, keeping $55 for herself. This is close to an even split.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation. So even if I managed to get more dollars in the next round, I'd need to secure at least $56.25 to beat the current $45 offer's value ($45 รท 0.8 = $56.25).

Given that the offer is reasonably fair and the inflation penalty is significant, I'll accept.
