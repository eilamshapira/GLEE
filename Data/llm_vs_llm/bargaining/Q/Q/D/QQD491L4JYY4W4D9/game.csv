550000.0,450000.0,Let's make this fair and efficient. I'm offering you a generous 45% to avoid lengthy negotiations that would reduce the money's value for me due to inflation.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Since inflation affects you but not me, you should consider accepting this offer now. If we continue negotiating, each round will reduce the real value of your share by 5%. This is a fair offer considering our different positions.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
520000.0,480000.0,"Let's be reasonable. I'm offering you a slightly better deal than my first proposal to show good faith. With inflation affecting my share, we should conclude this quickly. This is a fair 52-48 split that benefits us both.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
425000.0,575000.0,"I've reduced my previous demand from 600k to 575k as a sign of compromise. Consider that your 425k now is worth more than a potentially larger amount later due to your 5% inflation per round. If we continue for just 2 more rounds, you'll lose another 10% value. This is a fair offer given our positions, and we should conclude quickly.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"I'm now offering a perfectly equal 50-50 split. This is my most reasonable offer yet, taking into account both the inflation pressure on my side and the principle of fairness. Further delays will hurt both of us - let's conclude this now with a balanced agreement.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"I appreciate your move toward a 50-50 split, and I'm responding with a more moderate proposal than my previous ones. Your 450k now is worth significantly more than a larger amount later, as you've already lost 18.55% to inflation. If we continue for just two more rounds, you'll lose another 10%. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances, and it's time to conclude.",Bob,6,
