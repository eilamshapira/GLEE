"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's make this fair and efficient. I'm offering you a generous 45% to avoid lengthy negotiations that would reduce the money's value for me due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since inflation affects you but not me, you should consider accepting this offer now. If we continue negotiating, each round will reduce the real value of your share by 5%. This is a fair offer considering our different positions. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is too low. Even with the 5% inflation penalty, I can still get a better deal in the next round. Bob is trying to use the inflation pressure to his advantage, but 40% is not fair given that we started with equal negotiating positions."

Round 3

I'm offering you a slightly better deal than my first proposal to show good faith. With inflation affecting my share, we should conclude this quickly. This is a fair 52-48 split that benefits us both.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've reduced my previous demand from 600k to 575k as a sign of compromise. Consider that your 425k now is worth more than a potentially larger amount later due to your 5% inflation per round. If we continue for just 2 more rounds, you'll lose another 10% value. This is a fair offer given our positions, and we should conclude quickly. 
# Alice gain: 425000 
# Bob gain: 575000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

While Bob is showing some movement in the right direction, this offer is still too low. Even with the inflation penalty increasing, I can still propose a better deal in the next round. The threat of inflation is real, but Bob's offer doesn't reflect a fair split given our starting positions."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""I'm now offering a perfectly equal 50-50 split. This is my most reasonable offer yet, taking into account both the inflation pressure on my side and the principle of fairness. Further delays will hurt both of us - let's conclude this now with a balanced agreement.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your move toward a 50-50 split, and I'm responding with a more moderate proposal than my previous ones. Your 450k now is worth significantly more than a larger amount later, as you've already lost 18.55% to inflation. If we continue for just two more rounds, you'll lose another 10%. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances, and it's time to conclude. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. Bob has moved to a more reasonable position, and with the increasing inflation penalty (22.62% already lost), continuing to negotiate would significantly reduce the real value of my share. A $450,000 share now is better than risking further erosion of value through additional rounds of negotiation."
