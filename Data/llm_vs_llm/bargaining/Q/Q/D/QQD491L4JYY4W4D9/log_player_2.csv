"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make this fair and efficient. I'm offering you a generous 45% to avoid lengthy negotiations that would reduce the money's value for me due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me 450,000$
2. She's right about inflation affecting her more (5% per round for her, 0% for me)
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer, but she might reject it
4. We still have 11 rounds left if I reject
5. Since inflation doesn't affect me, I can afford to negotiate for a better deal
6. 450,000$ is less than half, and I have a strong negotiating position due to the inflation difference

I believe I can get a better deal by rejecting this offer and making a counter-proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a strategic counter-offer:

{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Since inflation affects you but not me, you should consider accepting this offer now. If we continue negotiating, each round will reduce the real value of your share by 5%. This is a fair offer considering our different positions.""}

This offer is justified because:
1. I'm not affected by inflation, so I can afford to be patient
2. Alice loses 5% value each round, so she has more pressure to agree quickly
3. The 60-40 split reflects my stronger negotiating position
4. My message explains the rational basis for this division
5. It's not so extreme that it would likely trigger a prolonged negotiation"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. I'm offering you a slightly better deal than my first proposal to show good faith. With inflation affecting my share, we should conclude this quickly. This is a fair 52-48 split that benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this updated offer:

1. Alice has increased her offer from 450,000$ to 480,000$ for me
2. The inflation has already reduced her real value by 9.75%
3. Her 520,000$ is actually worth about 469,300$ to her now
4. We still have 9 rounds left, but each round costs her 5% more
5. She's showing willingness to negotiate and move in my direction
6. However, given my stronger position (no inflation), I can still push for more

While this is a better offer, my position grows stronger with each round, and I believe I can still get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 575000,
""alice_gain"": 425000,
""message"": ""I've reduced my previous demand from 600k to 575k as a sign of compromise. Consider that your 425k now is worth more than a potentially larger amount later due to your 5% inflation per round. If we continue for just 2 more rounds, you'll lose another 10% value. This is a fair offer given our positions, and we should conclude quickly.""}

My reasoning:
1. I've moved down from my previous 600k demand to show willingness to compromise
2. The 575k-425k split is still advantageous to me but more reasonable than my last offer
3. The message emphasizes the time pressure on Alice due to inflation
4. Alice's 425k now is worth more than 520k several rounds later due to compound inflation
5. This offer balances between leveraging my stronger position and maintaining constructive negotiation
6. It's a reasonable middle ground that gives Alice a strong incentive to accept"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm now offering a perfectly equal 50-50 split. This is my most reasonable offer yet, taking into account both the inflation pressure on my side and the principle of fairness. Further delays will hurt both of us - let's conclude this now with a balanced agreement. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this 50-50 offer:

1. Alice has increased her offer to 500,000$ for me, up from 480,000$
2. Her 500,000$ is now worth only about 407,250$ to her due to 18.55% inflation
3. She's made significant concessions from her initial 45-55 split
4. We still have 7 rounds left, but each round costs her another 5%
5. A 50-50 split would typically be considered fair in most circumstances
6. However, given the asymmetric inflation effect, I still have a stronger position

While this is a very reasonable offer in absolute terms, the inflation asymmetry means I can still potentially get a better deal. The risk of continued negotiation is entirely on her side.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I appreciate your move toward a 50-50 split, and I'm responding with a more moderate proposal than my previous ones. Your 450k now is worth significantly more than a larger amount later, as you've already lost 18.55% to inflation. If we continue for just two more rounds, you'll lose another 10%. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances, and it's time to conclude.""}

My reasoning:
1. I've moderated my demand from 575k to 550k to show continued willingness to compromise
2. The offer acknowledges Alice's movement toward the middle and responds constructively
3. 450k for Alice now is worth more than 500k would be after several more rounds of 5% inflation
4. We're moving closer to a mutually acceptable number
5. The message emphasizes both cooperation and the practical reality of inflation
6. This 55-45 split reflects both the inflation asymmetry and a desire to reach agreement

This offer balances my strong negotiating position with the need to move toward a conclusion. It's a reasonable step that should be attractive given Alice's inflation pressure."
