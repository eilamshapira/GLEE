"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically.

Alice is offering me $400,000 (40%) while keeping $600,000 (60%) for herself. 

Considerations:
1. This is a decent amount of money
2. Inflation doesn't affect me, so my $400,000 maintains its value
3. I don't know how inflation affects Alice
4. We have 11 more rounds if I reject
5. I could counter with a better offer next round

While $400,000 is substantial, I believe I can negotiate for a better split since I'm not affected by inflation and have multiple rounds to negotiate. I'll reject this offer to propose a more favorable split in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer, but still slightly in my favor since I'm not affected by inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I propose a 55-45 split in my favor, which still leaves Alice with a substantial amount while giving me a better deal than her initial offer. This is a fair middle ground that acknowledges both parties' need for a significant share while being more equitable than the first proposal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is offering a 50-50 split ($500,000 each)
2. I'm not affected by inflation, so my $500,000 maintains full value
3. Alice's portion is affected by 36% inflation, so her $500,000 is actually worth only $320,000 to her
4. Alice is clearly feeling pressure from the inflation
5. We still have 9 rounds left, but the inflation is significantly impacting Alice's position

While I could potentially negotiate for an even better deal given Alice's weakening position due to inflation, this offer is already quite favorable to me:
- I get $500,000 at full value
- Alice gets $500,000 at reduced value
- This is better than her first offer ($400,000)
- The absolute amount is good

Given these factors, I'll accept this offer. It's a fair nominal split that actually advantages me due to the inflation dynamics.
