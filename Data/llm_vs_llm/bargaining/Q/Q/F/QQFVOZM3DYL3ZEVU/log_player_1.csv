"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be realistic, Alice. I'm feeling generous today, take this deal while you can. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept this offer, my $30 would be worth 20% less than its original value, which is $24.

I think I can do better than that. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each round, and 5% less for Bob, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself while still being reasonable.

In Round 1, the value was 100%.
In Round 2, the value for me was 80%, and for Bob, it was 95%.
In Round 3, the value for me will be 64% (80% * 0.8), and for Bob, it will be 90.25% (95% * 0.95).

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 40, 
""bob_gain"": 60, 
""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground before inflation eats away too much!""}"
