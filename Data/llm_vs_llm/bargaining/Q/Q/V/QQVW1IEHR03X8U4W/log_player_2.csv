"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me after the first round, the total amount I consider is $10,000 * 0.95 = $9,500. 

To make a fair offer, I'll consider a 50-50 split of the $9,500.
My gain: $9,500 * 0.5 = $4,750
Alice's gain: $9,500 * 0.5 = $4,750

However, since the original amount was $10,000, I need to scale it back to that.
My gain: $4,750 / 0.95 = $5,000
Alice's gain: $10,000 - $5,000 = $5,000

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""My turn, fair 50-50 split""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle of 60-40 and 50-50 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is worth 5% less after the first round and another 5% less after the second round, which is a total of 10% less. However, I'm given that it's 9.75% less than in the first round. 

So, if I accept Alice's offer, my $4200 is actually worth $4200 / 0.9225 = $4551.42 in the original value.

Given this, I'll consider the offer.
