"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 50-50 split, I would get $50. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me, meaning the maximum I could get would be worth $80 (100% - 20% = 80% of original value).

While I could try to negotiate for more, a 50-50 split is quite fair, and the risk of losing value due to inflation makes accepting now more attractive than trying to get more in subsequent rounds.
