Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, the value of the money decreases. 
For me (Alice), the money is worth 10% less in each round, so in round 3, it's worth 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 of the original value.
For Bob, the money is worth 5% less in each round, so in round 3, it's worth 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025 of the original value.

To make a fair offer, I'll consider these values.
