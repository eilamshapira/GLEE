"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. Alice is offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance. However, I know that:

1. If I reject, I can make my own offer next round
2. Alice's money loses value faster than mine (10% vs 5% per round)
3. This means Alice has more incentive to accept an offer quickly

Given these factors, I believe I can get a better deal by rejecting this offer and proposing a split more favorable to me in the next round. Alice will be more likely to accept due to her higher depreciation rate.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice faces a higher depreciation rate (10% vs my 5%), I'll propose a split slightly in my favor. If she rejects, her next round value will depreciate more than mine, so she has an incentive to accept a reasonable offer now.

I'll propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which is enough of an improvement for me while still being acceptable to Alice given the depreciation pressure she faces.

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

Let me also add a brief explanation to Alice: ""Given the different depreciation rates we face, this split is fair and beneficial to both of us to accept now rather than continue negotiating."""
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has increased her offer to me from 50 to 55
2. Current depreciation:
   * My value loss: 9.75%
   * Alice's value loss: 19%
3. If I reject:
   * Next round my value loss will be ~14.75%
   * Alice's value loss will be ~29%
   * That's a significant loss for both of us

Given that:
- Alice has moved significantly from her initial position (50 â†’ 55)
- The next round would mean substantial value loss for both of us
- The offer is now in my favor
- Further negotiation might lead to more value destruction

This is a reasonable offer that I should accept.
