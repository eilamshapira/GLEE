"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split, let's end this quickly before inflation hits 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $400,000 and keeping $600,000
2. This is a 60-40 split in Alice's favor
3. She's right about inflation - if I reject, next round will only have $950,000 real value
4. However, this first offer seems a bit unfair - why should Alice get a larger share?
5. I can propose next round and might get a better deal, even accounting for 5% inflation

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split while acknowledging the inflation pressure:

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Let's do a fair split that's slightly in my favor since I'm making the offer. If you reject, we both lose due to 5% inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer, slightly in my favor. Inflation is eating away, let's settle 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is offering me $430,000, which due to 9.75% inflation is actually worth about $388,100
2. If I reject, next round will have even more inflation (14.5% from original value)
3. Alice has moved from her original 60-40 split to a 57-43 split, showing willingness to negotiate
4. The real value of money is decreasing quickly, and further negotiations might hurt both of us
5. This is a reasonable improvement from her first offer, and the inflation risk is significant
