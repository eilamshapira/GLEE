"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to decide whether to accept or reject Alice's offer of $400,000 for me and $600,000 for her.

While I could get a decent amount ($400,000), I'm in a strong position as I can make the next offer if I reject. The split is somewhat favorable to Alice, and we have many rounds remaining to negotiate.

I'll reject this offer to propose a more balanced split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced division while still being respectful and reasonable.

""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""I think a 50-50 split is the fairest approach. We both walk away with equal shares, which seems most equitable given our equal positions in this negotiation.""}"
