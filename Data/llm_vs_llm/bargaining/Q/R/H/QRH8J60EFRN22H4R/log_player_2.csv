"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this carefully. Alice is offering me 4000$ out of 10,000$, which is a 40% share. While this isn't an equal split, it's a reasonable starting offer. Since there's no inflation penalty for me in future rounds, I could reject and counter-offer, but there's also the risk that Alice might make a worse offer in response to a rejection.

Given that 4000$ is a substantial amount and there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in future rounds, I'll accept this offer.
