50.0,50.0,"Hi Bob, I propose a fair split of $100 with $50 for each of us. Let's settle this round to avoid any loss from delay. Looking forward to your acceptance!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I think I can provide more value in this collaboration.  How about a 60/40 split in my favor?  We can settle it now and both walk away with something.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your proposal but I'll hold out for a division that reflects the fairness from round one. My counter-proposal is coming in the next round.",Alice,2,reject
52.0,48.0,"Hi Bob, I’m proposing we settle now. With your share losing an extra 5% in value this round (making it 10% below round 1’s value), waiting will only hurt you further. I’m offering you $48 while I take $52. This way, you secure an immediate effective payoff of about $43.20, which should compare favorably with what you might get if we delay any further. Let’s close this round and avoid more inflation-induced losses!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
45.0,55.0,"Alice, it seems like we both want to finalize this quickly. Let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 55/45 split.  It's a fair offer considering the time pressure and the fact that we both lose if this drags on.",Bob,4,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate that you're trying to move us closer to a final agreement. However, I feel that the 55/45 split doesn't properly reflect the relative positions we’re in. While you’re accepting a heavier inflation hit on your share, I’m not, and the balance seems off to me. I’d like to hold out a bit longer and propose a new division in the next round that more equitably considers the value depreciation you're facing. Let’s work together toward a fair resolution.",Alice,4,reject
54.0,46.0,"Hi Bob, with each additional round your share loses more value and we both risk ending up with even less. I'm offering you $46 and keeping $54 for myself. Settling now secures you a better effective value than any future round might, especially with the accelerating inflation on your share. Let's close this round and finalize our split for our mutual benefit.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
48.0,52.0,"Alice, let's stop wasting time and settle this. I understand your position, so I'm willing to compromise. 52/48 is my final offer.  It's a fair deal, and if we don't agree now, we both risk losing out. ",Bob,6,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but your final offer gives me only $48 when I could secure a better deal by making the next proposal. Given that my share isn’t affected by inflation while yours is, I believe there's still room for us to improve the division for both our sakes. Let's move to the next round and finalize a division that better reflects the current value dynamics.",Alice,6,reject
56.0,44.0,"Hi Bob, with every round your share loses more value—by now it's roughly 30% lower in real terms. To avoid further depreciation, I'm offering you $44 and keeping $56. This deal gives you an immediate effective payoff of about $30.8, which is better than the risk of even steeper devaluation if we delay further. Let's settle now for our mutual benefit.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
50.0,50.0,"Alice, this back and forth is helping neither of us.  We both lose if this drags on. I'm offering a straightforward 50/50 split. Take it or leave it. This is my final offer.",Bob,8,
,,"Hi Bob, I agree. A 50/50 split now secures us both a fair share before any further devaluation occurs. Let's settle on this and move forward.",Alice,8,accept
