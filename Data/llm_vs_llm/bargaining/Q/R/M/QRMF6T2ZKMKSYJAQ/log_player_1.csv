Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I think I can provide more value in this collaboration.  How about a 60/40 split in my favor?  We can settle it now and both walk away with something.

Round 3

With your share losing an extra 5% in value this round (making it 10% below round 1’s value), waiting will only hurt you further. I’m offering you $48 while I take $52. This way, you secure an immediate effective payoff of about $43.20, which should compare favorably with what you might get if we delay any further. Let’s close this round and avoid more inflation-induced losses!""}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems like we both want to finalize this quickly. Let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 55/45 split.  It's a fair offer considering the time pressure and the fact that we both lose if this drags on.

# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate that you're trying to move us closer to a final agreement. However, I feel that the 55/45 split doesn't properly reflect the relative positions we’re in. While you’re accepting a heavier inflation hit on your share, I’m not, and the balance seems off to me. I’d like to hold out a bit longer and propose a new division in the next round that more equitably considers the value depreciation you're facing. Let’s work together toward a fair resolution.""}"

I'm offering you $46 and keeping $54 for myself. Settling now secures you a better effective value than any future round might, especially with the accelerating inflation on your share. Let's close this round and finalize our split for our mutual benefit.""}"

Round 6

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's stop wasting time and settle this. I understand your position, so I'm willing to compromise. 52/48 is my final offer.  It's a fair deal, and if we don't agree now, we both risk losing out.  
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but your final offer gives me only $48 when I could secure a better deal by making the next proposal. Given that my share isn’t affected by inflation while yours is, I believe there's still room for us to improve the division for both our sakes. Let's move to the next round and finalize a division that better reflects the current value dynamics.""}"
