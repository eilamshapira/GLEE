"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a fair split of $100 with $50 for each of us. Let's settle this round to avoid any loss from delay. Looking forward to your acceptance!

# Alice gain: 50

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m proposing we settle now. With your share losing an extra 5% in value this round (making it 10% below round 1’s value), waiting will only hurt you further. I’m offering you $48 while I take $52. This way, you secure an immediate effective payoff of about $43.20, which should compare favorably with what you might get if we delay any further. Let’s close this round and avoid more inflation-induced losses! 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

I'm not going to panic. While Alice is right about the inflation affecting my share, she's clearly trying to use it to pressure me into a less favorable deal. I need to hold my ground a little longer and see if I can get her closer to a 55/45 split."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Alice, it seems like we both want to finalize this quickly. Let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 55/45 split.  It's a fair offer considering the time pressure and the fact that we both lose if this drags on."" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, with each additional round your share loses more value and we both risk ending up with even less. I'm offering you $46 and keeping $54 for myself. Settling now secures you a better effective value than any future round might, especially with the accelerating inflation on your share. Let's close this round and finalize our split for our mutual benefit. 
# Bob gain: 46 
# Alice gain: 54 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

This is getting tight, but I'm not giving in yet. Alice is clearly trying to use the time pressure against me.  I need to hold firm for one more round and see if I can get her to compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 52,
""alice_gain"": 48,
""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time and settle this. I understand your position, so I'm willing to compromise. 52/48 is my final offer.  It's a fair deal, and if we don't agree now, we both risk losing out. "" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, with every round your share loses more value—by now it's roughly 30% lower in real terms. To avoid further depreciation, I'm offering you $44 and keeping $56. This deal gives you an immediate effective payoff of about $30.8, which is better than the risk of even steeper devaluation if we delay further. Let's settle now for our mutual benefit. 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

This is getting dangerous, but I still think I can get a better deal. Alice is clearly trying to scare me with the inflation rate, but I'm willing to gamble that she doesn't want to walk away with nothing."

{
""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Alice, this back and forth is helping neither of us.  We both lose if this drags on. I'm offering a straightforward 50/50 split. Take it or leave it. This is my final offer.""
