"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer gives me $100,000 while she takes $900,000, which is only 10% of the total for me. This is quite inequitable given that we're supposed to be dividing the money between us. I believe I can propose a more balanced division in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more balanced division of the money.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I believe a 50-50 split is the most fair approach to dividing the money. We both deserve an equal share, and this way we both come away with a substantial amount that can make a meaningful difference in our lives."
