550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob. Since every round delays our deal and reduces my share’s value by 20%, I propose we settle now with a near‐fair split: I receive $550000 and you get $450000. This way, we both get a substantial amount without any further loss from delay. What do you think?",Alice,1,

520000.0,480000.0,"Hi Alice. Your previous offer was close, but considering my inflation rate, I'd like to propose a slightly adjusted split. I receive $480000 and you get $520000. This gives you a majority while recognizing the value loss on my side. Let's make a deal!",Bob,2,
