"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob. Since every round delays our deal and reduces my share’s value by 20%, I propose we settle now with a near‐fair split: I receive $550,000 and you get $450,000. This way, we both get a substantial amount without any further loss from delay. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice. Your previous offer was close, but considering my inflation rate, I'd like to propose a slightly adjusted split. I receive $480000 and you get $520000. This gives you a majority while recognizing the value loss on my side. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
