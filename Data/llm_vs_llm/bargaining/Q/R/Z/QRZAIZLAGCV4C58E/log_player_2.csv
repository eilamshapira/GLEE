"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob. Since every round delays our deal and reduces my share’s value by 20%, I propose we settle now with a near‐fair split: I receive $550000 and you get $450000. This way, we both get a substantial amount without any further loss from delay. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice. Your previous offer was close, but considering my inflation rate, I'd like to propose a slightly adjusted split. I receive $480,000 and you get $520,000. This gives you a majority while recognizing the value loss on my side. Let's make a deal!""}"
