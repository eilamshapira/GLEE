Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's try this again. I'm offering a slightly better split this time, 55/45.  This is a good deal, especially with inflation eating away at the value. Take it! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
