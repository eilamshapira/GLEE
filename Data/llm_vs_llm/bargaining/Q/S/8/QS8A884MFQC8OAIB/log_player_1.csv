"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'd like to offer a fair split considering the inflation effect on my side.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm offering you $400,000 Bob, which is a substantial amount. I'm asking for slightly more because I know that any delay will cost me 20% of the value due to inflation, so I need to account for that risk in my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to find a more agreeable compromise considering the inflation effect.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

Bob, I'm offering you $450,000, which is more than my first offer. Since the money loses 20% of its value for me each round, we both benefit from reaching an agreement now rather than continuing negotiations. This split is fair given the inflation constraints I'm facing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
