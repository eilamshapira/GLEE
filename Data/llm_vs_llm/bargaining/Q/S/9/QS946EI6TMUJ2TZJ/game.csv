7143.0,2857.0,"Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $7143 and you receive $2857. This split reflects our differing rates of discounting: with each extra round, my money loses 10% of its value while yours loses 20%. Accepting now secures both of us a better outcome than waiting. I hope you agree to this fair division and letâ€™s conclude the deal promptly.",Alice,1,

5500.0,4500.0,"Alice, I understand your point about the different discount rates, but your initial split was too extreme. I'm proposing a more balanced 45-55 split that still favors you while being fairer to both of us. Remember, if you reject, both of us will lose more value (10% for you, 20% for me) in the next round, making us both worse off than accepting this reasonable offer now.",Bob,2,
