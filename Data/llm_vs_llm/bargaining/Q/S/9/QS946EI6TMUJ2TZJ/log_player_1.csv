"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7143, ""bob_gain"": 2857, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $7,143 and you receive $2,857. This split reflects our differing rates of discounting: with each extra round, my money loses 10% of its value while yours loses 20%. Accepting now secures both of us a better outcome than waiting. I hope you agree to this fair division and letâ€™s conclude the deal promptly.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your point about the different discount rates, but your initial split was too extreme. I'm proposing a more balanced 45-55 split that still favors you while being fairer to both of us. Remember, if you reject, both of us will lose more value (10% for you, 20% for me) in the next round, making us both worse off than accepting this reasonable offer now. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
