"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $7143 and you receive $2857. This split reflects our differing rates of discounting: with each extra round, my money loses 10% of its value while yours loses 20%. Accepting now secures both of us a better outcome than waiting. I hope you agree to this fair division and letâ€™s conclude the deal promptly. 
# Bob gain: 2857 
# Alice gain: 7143 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Current offer: $2,857 for me, $7,143 for Alice

2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
- The total value will depreciate
- My money will be worth 20% less
- Alice's money will be worth 10% less
- Even if I propose a better split for myself, the absolute value I receive might be lower due to the steep 20% depreciation

3. Alice's reasoning about the different discount rates is valid, but the proposed split seems too favorable to her. Even with different discount rates, this 71.4%/28.6% split appears excessive.

4. If I reject, I could propose a more balanced split next round, but I need to weigh this against the 20% depreciation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll take my chances with making a counter-offer next round, as this split is too uneven, even accounting for the different discount rates."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me propose a more balanced split while acknowledging our different discount rates:

{""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your point about the different discount rates, but your initial split was too extreme. I'm proposing a more balanced 45-55 split that still favors you while being fairer to both of us. Remember, if you reject, both of us will lose more value (10% for you, 20% for me) in the next round, making us both worse off than accepting this reasonable offer now.""}

This offer is strategic because:
1. It acknowledges the discount rate difference by still giving Alice more
2. It's much more balanced than her initial 71/29 split
3. The message emphasizes our mutual interest in avoiding further depreciation
4. It's a significant improvement for me while still being attractive enough for Alice to consider accepting"
