"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's divide the money fairlyâ€”50$ each. Concluding the game now avoids the inflation penalty on my end. I hope you agree to this quick and fair resolution! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair on the surface. However, I need to consider the inflation effect on my end. If I reject this offer, the money will be worth 20% less to me in the next round, meaning I'd need to get at least 62.5$ in the next round to match what 50$ is worth now.

Given that I'll have the opportunity to make a counteroffer in the next round, but will face that 20% inflation penalty, I think it's reasonable to accept this fair initial offer rather than risk getting less value later.
