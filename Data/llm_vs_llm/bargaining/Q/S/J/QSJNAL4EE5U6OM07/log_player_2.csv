"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60/40 split. Let's get this over with! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's proposal carefully. She's offering a 60/40 split, with her getting 60% and me getting 40% of the $100. 

However, I should be mindful of the inflation aspect of this game. If I reject and we move to the next round, the money will be worth 10% less to me, while it maintains full value for Alice. This gives her a strategic advantage in later rounds.

If I accept now, I get $40 at full value. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, even if I asked for more, the value would be decreased by 10% for me.

Given the inflation penalty that affects only me, accepting this initial offer might be reasonable.
