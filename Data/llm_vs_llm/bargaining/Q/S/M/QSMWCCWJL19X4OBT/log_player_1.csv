"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair and reasonable split with a slight advantage for me since I'm making the first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split to ensure both of us get a substantial amount, with a small premium for me as the first mover. This is a fair offer that leaves both parties with a good outcome."
