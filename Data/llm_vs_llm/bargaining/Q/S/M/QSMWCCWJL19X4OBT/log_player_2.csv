"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's proposal carefully.

She's offering me $4500 out of the $10,000, which is 45% of the total. While this isn't an equal 50/50 split, it's reasonably close and represents a substantial amount of money.

I could reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, but there's no guarantee Alice would accept a more favorable proposal from me. Since $4500 is a significant portion of the total and not far from an even split, I'll accept this offer.
