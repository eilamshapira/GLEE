"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. Alice is proposing a perfectly equal split of $50 each, which is fair. If I reject, we move to the next round where I can make an offer, but the total amount will be worth 10% less ($90 total). Even if I try to get a larger share in the next round, the decreased total value means I might end up with less than $50.

Therefore, I'll accept this fair offer.
