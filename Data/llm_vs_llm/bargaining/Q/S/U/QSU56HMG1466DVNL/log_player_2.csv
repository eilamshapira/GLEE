"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject this offer as it's clearly unfair. Since Alice faces a 10% depreciation per round and I don't face any depreciation, I have a stronger negotiating position. I should be able to get a much better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice faces 10% depreciation per round and I don't, I can offer her a smaller portion while still making it attractive compared to waiting another round. If she rejects this offer, her potential gains in the next round will be worth 10% less to her.

{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}

I propose this split because:
1. It's much better for me than her initial lowball offer
2. If Alice rejects, her next round's money will be worth 10% less to her
3. It still gives her a significant amount that she might accept rather than risk further depreciation"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject this offer. Even though Alice offered me more than her first offer, it's still not a good deal for me. With Alice facing 19% depreciation already and another 10% if we go to the next round, I have a strong negotiating position. I can get a better deal in the next round, as her urgency to settle should be increasing due to the depreciation she faces.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that Alice is now facing significant depreciation (her next round would be at 29% depreciation), I can make a stronger offer in my favor. She should be more inclined to accept now to avoid further value loss.

{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000}

I propose this split because:
1. If Alice rejects, her money in the next round will be worth 29% less to her
2. She's shown more flexibility by increasing her offer to me from 100k to 200k
3. The 200k I'm offering her now is worth more to her than a larger amount in future rounds due to her depreciation
4. I maintain a strong negotiating position as I face no depreciation"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject this offer. Even though Alice keeps increasing her offers to me, the fact that she's now facing 34.39% depreciation and would face another 10% in the next round puts me in an even stronger position. Her money is rapidly losing value while mine maintains its worth, so I can continue to negotiate for a better split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that Alice is now facing severe depreciation (her next round would be at 44.39% depreciation), and she's shown a pattern of gradually increasing offers, I'll maintain a strong position but offer slightly less than my previous offer to show some willingness to compromise.

{""bob_gain"": 750000, ""alice_gain"": 250000}

I propose this split because:
1. Alice's next round would face 44.39% depreciation, making any future gains significantly less valuable for her
2. I've reduced my demand slightly from 800k to 750k to show some flexibility
3. The 250k I'm offering her now is worth significantly more to her than waiting for future rounds
4. She's demonstrated willingness to negotiate by gradually increasing her offers
5. I still maintain leverage as I face no depreciation"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject this offer. Although Alice continues to increase her offers (now at 400k), she's facing extremely high depreciation at 46.86% and would face another 10% next round. This means her 600k would be worth only about 320k in real value to her now, and even less next round. My negotiating position remains very strong as my money maintains its full value.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With Alice now facing severe depreciation (her next round would be at 56.86% depreciation), and given her pattern of steadily increasing offers, I'll maintain a strong position but offer slightly more than my last offer to encourage acceptance.

{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}

I propose this split because:
1. Alice's money is now worth less than half its original value, and would lose another 10% if she rejects
2. I've reduced my demand from 750k to 700k to show more flexibility
3. The 300k I'm offering her now is worth significantly more than a larger amount in future rounds due to her severe depreciation
4. She's shown consistent willingness to negotiate by increasing her offers (from 100k to 400k for me)
5. This offer gives her a more substantial amount while still maintaining my advantageous position
6. If she rejects, her money will be worth less than 45% of its original value in the next round"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept this offer. While I could theoretically continue negotiating for more, there are several reasons to accept now:

1. Alice has finally offered an equal split (500k/500k)
2. Due to the 56.95% depreciation Alice faces, her 500k is actually only worth about 215k to her in real value, while my 500k maintains full value
3. Alice has shown consistent willingness to improve her offers
4. There's always a risk in pushing too hard that negotiations could break down
5. This is a fair outcome given the depreciation effects
