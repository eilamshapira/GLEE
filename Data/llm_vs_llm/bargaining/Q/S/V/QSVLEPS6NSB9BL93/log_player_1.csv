"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm taking the initiative to make the first offer. This is a fair proposal that gives us both a substantial amount.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think 60-40 is a bit biased. How about we do a 55-45 split? This way, we both get a good amount, and it's more balanced. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Reasoning (not part of response): Since Bob's money is affected by 5% inflation, his $5500 is actually worth $5225 to him. I can try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round, knowing that further inflation will affect his portion while mine stays stable. I'll make a counter-offer that takes this into account."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Bob, considering the time pressure and inflation effects, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This is more balanced than my initial offer and gives you a solid $4500. Let's not risk further delays that could reduce the value for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the adjustment in your offer, but I still think we can do better. Considering the inflation effect on my end, I propose a 52.5-47.5 split. This is a more even compromise, and I'm willing to settle for this to avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Reasoning (not part of response): This is a reasonable offer to accept because:
1. With 14.26% inflation on Bob's end, his $5250 is actually worth about $4501 to him
2. My $4750 maintains its full value
3. We're already in round 4, and with 12 rounds total, prolonging the negotiation risks getting nothing if we can't reach an agreement
4. The split is relatively fair considering all factors
5. Further negotiations might not yield significantly better results given the inflation pressure on Bob's side"
