"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm taking the initiative to make the first offer. This is a fair proposal that gives us both a substantial amount.

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I think 60-40 is a bit biased. How about we do a 55-45 split? This way, we both get a good amount, and it's more balanced.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering the time pressure and inflation effects, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This is more balanced than my initial offer and gives you a solid $4500. Let's not risk further delays that could reduce the value for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

""alice_gain"": 4750, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the adjustment in your offer, but I still think we can do better. Considering the inflation effect on my end, I propose a 52.5-47.5 split. This is a more even compromise, and I'm willing to settle for this to avoid further losses.""}"
