"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's start with a fair split where I get a bit more to account for potential future inflation affecting me more. This gives us both a good starting point. Accept and we both win! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice is offering me $4,500 out of $10,000
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 5% less next round
3. Next round I could propose, but Alice might reject
4. $4,500 now is better than $4,750 (half of $9,500) next round
5. Fair opening offer considering inflation uncertainty
