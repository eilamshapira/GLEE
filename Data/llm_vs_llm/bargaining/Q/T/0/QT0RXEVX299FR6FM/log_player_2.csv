"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share, let's end the game 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000
2. This is a 40-60 split in Alice's favor
3. If I reject, I can make my own proposal in the next round
4. While $400,000 is a substantial amount, it's not quite fair

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a counter-proposal in the next round, aiming for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a fair 50-50 split, which is the most equitable solution:

{
    ""bob_gain"": 500000,
    ""alice_gain"": 500000,
    ""message"": ""Let's split it equally - this is the fairest solution for both of us""
}"
