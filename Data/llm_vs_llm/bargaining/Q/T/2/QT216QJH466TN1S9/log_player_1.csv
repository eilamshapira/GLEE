"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 20, ""bob_gain"": 80, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that I take $20 and you get $80. Since you'll lose 20% of the value if we continue to later rounds, this offer gives you the full payoff you could secure in your turn at the next step. I hope you find this fair and efficient.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but I think we can find something more equitable. Let's split 60/40, recognizing the time pressure we both face. This way we both benefit substantially from reaching an agreement now. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
