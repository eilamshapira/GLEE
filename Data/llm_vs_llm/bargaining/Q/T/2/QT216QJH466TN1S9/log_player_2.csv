Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I take $20 and you get $80. Since you'll lose 20% of the value if we continue to later rounds, this offer gives you the full payoff you could secure in your turn at the next step. I hope you find this fair and efficient. 
# Bob gain: 80 
# Alice gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
