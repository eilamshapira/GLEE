"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, for our first round I propose a 50-50 split of the $100. Given that waiting costs me with inflation—and since future rounds only add uncertainty—I believe an even split is fair and beneficial for both of us. I hope you agree and we can settle this promptly. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
