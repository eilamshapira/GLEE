100.0,0.0,"Bob, here's the deal: I take all $100 and you get $0. Given that every subsequent round devalues your share by 20%, there's no benefit waiting. Accept now!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
15.0,85.0,"Alice, I understand the time pressure, but your initial offer was too extreme.  Let's be reasonable: I'll take $85, leaving you with a respectable $15.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
33.33,66.67,"Bob, here's my proposal for round 3: I get $33.33 and you get $66.67. At this point, your $66.67 is worth 60% of its nominal value (i.e. about $40), and if we delay further you’ll only see that number drop. Accepting now maximizes your effective payoff compared to waiting until round 4, where as proposer you’d face even steeper inflation on your funds.",Alice,3,
