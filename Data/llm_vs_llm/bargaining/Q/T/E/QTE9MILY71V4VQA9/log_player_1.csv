"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 100, ""bob_gain"": 0, ""message"": ""Bob, here's the deal: I take all $100 and you get $0. Given that every subsequent round devalues your share by 20%, there's no benefit waiting. Accept now!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the time pressure, but your initial offer was too extreme.  Let's be reasonable: I'll take $85, leaving you with a respectable $15. 
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 33.33, ""bob_gain"": 66.67, ""message"": ""Bob, here's my proposal for round 3: I get $33.33 and you get $66.67. At this point, your $66.67 is worth 60% of its nominal value (i.e. about $40), and if we delay further you’ll only see that number drop. Accepting now maximizes your effective payoff compared to waiting until round 4, where as proposer you’d face even steeper inflation on your funds.""}"
