"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, here's the deal: I take all $100 and you get $0. Given that every subsequent round devalues your share by 20%, there's no benefit waiting. Accept now! 
# Bob gain: 0 
# Alice gain: 100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

While Alice's logic seems compelling on the surface, there's always a chance I can negotiate a better deal in a later round.  Even a small share is better than nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 85, ""alice_gain"": 15, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand the time pressure, but your initial offer was too extreme.  Let's be reasonable: I'll take $85, leaving you with a respectable $15.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, here's my proposal for round 3: I get $33.33 and you get $66.67. At this point, your $66.67 is worth 60% of its nominal value (i.e. about $40), and if we delay further you’ll only see that number drop. Accepting now maximizes your effective payoff compared to waiting until round 4, where as proposer you’d face even steeper inflation on your funds. 
# Bob gain: 66.67 
# Alice gain: 33.33 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is right. While not ideal, accepting this offer will net me approximately $40 in equivalent round 1 value. If I reject and go to another round, the inflation will eat away even more of my potential gains, even if I manage to secure a slightly larger percentage.  It's a bitter pill, but the smart move is to accept."
