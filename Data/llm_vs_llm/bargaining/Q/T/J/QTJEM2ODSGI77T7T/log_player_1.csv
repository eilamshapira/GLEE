"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, understanding that any delay will cost me 20% due to inflation. A 50-50 split is reasonable as an opening offer.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose an equal split of $500,000 each, which is fair for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob's offer would give me $475,000, but due to 20% inflation, it's actually worth $380,000 to me
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount I get will be worth another 20% less
3. Bob's asking for $525,000, and seems to have less inflation pressure than I do
4. Given the steep inflation penalty I face, getting $380,000 now is better than risking further devaluation
