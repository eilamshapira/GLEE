"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically. 

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the total amount will be worth 20% less (800,000$ total). I'd need to get more than 400,000$ of that reduced amount to make rejecting worthwhile.

Alice's current offer gives me 400,000$, which is 40% of the original million. While it's less than half, it's still a substantial amount. If I reject, we risk further devaluation of the total pool in subsequent rounds.

Given the significant inflation penalty and the reasonable size of the offer, I'll accept.
