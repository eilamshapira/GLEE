"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a fair 50-50 split is reasonable for both of us. This way we both get $5000, which is much better than the previous offer. With inflation affecting you more than me (20% vs 10%), it's in your interest to accept this fair deal now rather than prolonging negotiations. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
