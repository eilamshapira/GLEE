"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make this quick and easy. I'll take the majority, but you still get a nice chunk. We both win! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice's offer would give me $1000, which is better than nothing, it's heavily weighted in her favor. Since I have the advantage of a lower inflation rate (10% vs her 20%), I can afford to go to another round with less impact on my potential earnings.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""I think a fair 50-50 split is reasonable for both of us. This way we both get $5000, which is much better than the previous offer. With inflation affecting you more than me (20% vs 10%), it's in your interest to accept this fair deal now rather than prolonging negotiations.""}"
