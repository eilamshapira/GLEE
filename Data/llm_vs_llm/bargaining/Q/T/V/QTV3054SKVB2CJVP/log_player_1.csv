Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer of a 50-50 split. Even with the 20% inflation from round 1, this is still a fair deal and better than risking further inflation in subsequent rounds. With this split, I'll receive $50 (worth $40 after inflation), which is a reasonable outcome."
