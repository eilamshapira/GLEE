"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Split it evenly, fair deal""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight adjustment, still keeping it fair considering the inflation for Alice. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, the $45 offered to me is actually worth $45 * 0.9 = $40.5 to me.

Given this, I think I can try to negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less in each round, I need to make a more favorable offer to myself to compensate for the inflation.

In Round 2, the money I gain was worth 10% less, so in Round 3, it's worth another 10% less, which means it's worth 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 of the original value.

With that in mind, here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 52, 
""bob_gain"": 48, 
""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a fair deal for me""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is affecting Alice more. This offer reflects that, but it's still a good deal for her considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of the offer considering the inflation.

Since the money I gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, the $40 offered to me is actually worth $40 * (1 - 0.271) = $40 * 0.729 = $29.16 to me.

Given this, I think the offer is not very favorable to me, but I should consider that the inflation will continue to decrease the value of the money for me in the next rounds.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less in each round, and it was already worth 27.1% less in Round 4, in Round 5, it's worth another 10% less, which means it's worth 0.9 * 0.729 = 0.6561 of the original value.

With that in mind, I need to make an offer that compensates for this significant decrease in value. Here's my offer for Round 5:

{""alice_gain"": 58, 
""bob_gain"": 42, 
""message"": ""Last chance for a reasonable deal, considering the inflation""}"
