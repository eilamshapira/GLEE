,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, I appreciate your fair spirit. However, with each round, the value for me drops by 20%, which pressures us both to settle quickly. I propose a 60-40 split in my favor—600K for me and 400K for you—to secure today's full value. Accepting this now avoids further losses and ensures we both walk away with significant amounts.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, I understand your concern about the value drop, but a 60-40 split seems a bit too steep given we started with a 50-50 proposal. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'll make my next offer soon.",Alice,2,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Bob, considering your concerns about the value drop and my desire for fairness, how about a 45-55 split? This way, you get more than half, but it's closer to our initial 50-50 proposal. Let's settle this soon.",Alice,3,
