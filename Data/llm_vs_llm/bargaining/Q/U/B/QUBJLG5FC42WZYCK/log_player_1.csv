Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your fair spirit. However, with each round, the value for me drops by 20%, which pressures us both to settle quickly. I propose a 60-40 split in my favor—600K for me and 400K for you—to secure today's full value. Accepting this now avoids further losses and ensures we both walk away with significant amounts. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Bob, I understand your concern about the value drop, but a 60-40 split seems a bit too steep given we started with a 50-50 proposal. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'll make my next offer soon.""

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{

  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
