Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, Bob. 50-50 split. What do you say?

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your fair spirit. However, with each round, the value for me drops by 20%, which pressures us both to settle quickly. I propose a 60-40 split in my favor—600K for me and 400K for you—to secure today's full value. Accepting this now avoids further losses and ensures we both walk away with significant amounts.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering your concerns about the value drop and my desire for fairness, how about a 45-55 split? This way, you get more than half, but it's closer to our initial 50-50 proposal. Let's settle this soon. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
