"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer.

Alice is offering me $4,500 out of $10,000, which is 45% of the total amount. If I reject, the money will be worth 10% less in the next round, meaning the total value for me will be $9,000. 

If I make a counter-offer in the next round, I could try to get more than $4,500. However, Alice might reject, and we'd lose another 10% value. Also, there's a risk of getting nothing if we can't agree within 12 rounds.

$4,500 is a decent offer considering:
1. It's close to a 50-50 split
2. Avoiding inflation risk
3. Securing a guaranteed amount rather than risking further negotiations
