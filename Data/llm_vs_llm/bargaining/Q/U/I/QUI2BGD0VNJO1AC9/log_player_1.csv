"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's make it an even split. 50-50 seems fair for both of us! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 5% inflation, $50 is now worth $47.50 to me. While this is less than my initial proposal would have given me, rejecting would mean facing another 5% inflation in the next round. Even if I could get a better split in round 3, it would be worth even less due to compounding inflation.

Additionally, a 50-50 split is objectively fair, and there's no guarantee I could get a better deal in future rounds.
