35.71,64.29,"Hi Bob, I propose that I take $35.71 and you get $64.29. Considering that if we delay the deal our money loses value—20% for me each round and 10% for you—this split reflects our differing discount factors. I believe this is a fair starting point for us both. What do you say?",Alice,1,

30.0,70.0,"I think your offer was a bit generous, Alice.  Let's try a split closer to 70/30, reflecting our respective discount rates. I'll take 70, and you get 30. What do you think?",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, I understand your proposal. Given how rapidly my share loses value with each round, I’d rather secure the current offer. I accept the 70/30 split.",Alice,2,accept
