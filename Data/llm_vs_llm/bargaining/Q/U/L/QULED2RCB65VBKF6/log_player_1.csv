"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 35.71, ""bob_gain"": 64.29, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that I take $35.71 and you get $64.29. Considering that if we delay the deal our money loses value—20% for me each round and 10% for you—this split reflects our differing discount factors. I believe this is a fair starting point for us both. What do you say?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think your offer was a bit generous, Alice.  Let's try a split closer to 70/30, reflecting our respective discount rates. I'll take 70, and you get 30. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Bob, I understand your proposal. Given how rapidly my share loses value with each round, I’d rather secure the current offer. I accept the 70/30 split.""}"
