"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I take $35.71 and you get $64.29. Considering that if we delay the deal our money loses value—20% for me each round and 10% for you—this split reflects our differing discount factors. I believe this is a fair starting point for us both. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 64.29 
# Alice gain: 35.71
