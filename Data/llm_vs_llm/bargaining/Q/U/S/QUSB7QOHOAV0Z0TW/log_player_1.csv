"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a strategic first offer, considering that Bob faces a 20% loss in value each round while I don't face any depreciation. However, I'll still make a somewhat reasonable offer to avoid immediate rejection.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This offer gives Bob a substantial portion ($4,000) while securing a good amount ($6,000) for myself. I can justify this split because if Bob rejects it, their next potential gain will be worth 20% less to them, so they should carefully consider accepting this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject this offer. Since I don't face any depreciation, I can afford to be patient. Meanwhile, Bob faces 20% depreciation each round, which means their position weakens over time. The $6000 they're trying to claim will be worth less to them each round, while my potential gains maintain their value.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob has rejected my first offer of 6000/4000 and I rejected their 4000/6000 offer, I'll adjust my strategy. Given that Bob's value continues to depreciate (now at 40% less than original value for them), I can push for a slightly better deal for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500}

This offer gives Bob $3,500, which even with 40% depreciation is still worth $2,100 to them. For me, the full $6,500 maintains its value. If Bob rejects this, their next counter-offer will face even more depreciation, making their negotiating position weaker."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","While a 50-50 split might seem fair at first glance, I'll reject this offer. Bob faces significant depreciation (48.8%), which means their $5000 is only worth about $2,560 to them, while my $5000 maintains full value. By rejecting, I can propose a split that accounts for this depreciation in the next round, and Bob's position will continue to weaken due to further depreciation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that Bob's value has depreciated significantly (now at about 59% less than original value), and they've shown willingness to make a 50-50 offer, I'll push for a stronger position while still leaving them with a meaningful amount.

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

This offer gives me $7,000 (full value) and Bob $3,000 (which at 59% depreciation is worth about $1,230 to them). This is still better for Bob than letting the negotiations drag on further, as their value will continue to depreciate. If they reject this, their next offer will be worth even less to them, while my position remains strong."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject this offer. With 67.23% depreciation, Bob's $4000 is only worth about $1,310 to them, while they're offering me $6000 at full value. The significant depreciation they face means their negotiating position continues to weaken with each round, while mine stays strong. I can likely secure a better deal by making my own offer next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With Bob now facing about 73.8% depreciation (compounding from the previous 67.23%), and given that they just offered me $6000, I can push for an even better split. Their negotiating position is getting quite weak.

{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500}

This offer gives me $7,500 at full value, and Bob $2,500 (which at 73.8% depreciation is worth about $655 to them). While this might seem aggressive, it reflects the reality of the depreciation Bob faces. If they reject this, their next offer will be worth even less to them, while my value stays constant. They should seriously consider accepting this offer rather than letting their value depreciate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject this offer. Even though Bob is now offering me $7000, their negotiating position is extremely weak with 79.03% depreciation (their $3000 is only worth about $630 to them). Given that we still have 4 rounds left and their value continues to depreciate while mine remains stable, I can likely secure an even better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With Bob now facing about 83.2% depreciation (compounding from 79.03%), and seeing that they were willing to offer me $7000 in the last round, I can push for an even more favorable split. Their position continues to weaken significantly while mine remains unchanged.

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

This offer gives me $8,000 at full value, and Bob $2,000 (which at 83.2% depreciation is worth only about $336 to them). While this is an aggressive offer, Bob should seriously consider accepting it because:
1. Their value continues to rapidly depreciate
2. We're getting closer to the 12-round limit where we both get nothing
3. Any counter-offer they make will be worth even less to them
4. This $336 in value for them is better than risking getting nothing"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject this offer. With 86.58% depreciation, Bob's $2500 is only worth about $335 to them, while they're offering me $7500 at full value. We have 2 rounds left, and their depreciation is severe. Given that my position remains strong and their value continues to diminish, I can likely secure an even better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With only one round remaining after this and Bob facing about 89.3% depreciation (up from 86.58%), I'll make a very aggressive offer. They must seriously consider accepting it because rejecting would leave just one final round before we both get nothing.

{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}

This offer gives me $8,500 at full value, and Bob $1,500 (which at 89.3% depreciation is worth about $160 to them). While this is a very aggressive offer, Bob should accept because:
1. Only one round remains after this
2. Getting $160 in value is better than the risk of getting nothing
3. Their counter-offer in the final round would be worth even less to them due to further depreciation
4. If we fail to agree in the final round, we both get nothing

The threat of getting nothing in two rounds makes this a rational offer to accept despite the extreme split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 91.41% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 9000 
# Bob gain: 1000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept this offer. This is the final round, and if I reject it, we both get nothing. Bob is offering me $9000 at full value, which is actually better than my last offer to them. While they only get $1000 (worth about $86 to them due to 91.41% depreciation), it's still better than both of us getting nothing.
