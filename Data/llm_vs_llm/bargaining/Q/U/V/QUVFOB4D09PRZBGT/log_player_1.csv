"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll play as Alice and make an offer for dividing $1,000,000 with Bob.

I need to be mindful that with each round, the money is worth 5% less to me due to inflation, so there's an incentive to reach agreement earlier rather than later.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I suggest we split the money with me getting $550,000 and you getting $450,000. This is a reasonable first offer that gives both of us a substantial amount, while acknowledging that I need to account for potential inflation if negotiations continue."
