"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Alice is offering me $450,000 out of $1,000,000, which is 45% of the total amount. 

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but due to 20% inflation, the money will be worth less to me. My $450,000 would effectively become worth $360,000 if I wait one round.

Since this is a pretty fair initial offer (close to 50-50), and considering the inflation penalty I face, I should accept this offer rather than risk getting less in future rounds.
