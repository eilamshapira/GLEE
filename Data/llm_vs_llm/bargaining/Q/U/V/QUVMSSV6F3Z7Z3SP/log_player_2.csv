"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 8000 
# Alice gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
- Alice is offering me $8,000 (80%) and taking $2,000 (20%)
- This is actually a very generous first offer
- If I reject, in the next round the money will be worth 20% less to me
- So $8,000 now is better than potentially getting more in future rounds
- There's also risk in rejecting since we only have 12 rounds

Given the generous split and the risk of value depreciation for me, I should accept this offer.
