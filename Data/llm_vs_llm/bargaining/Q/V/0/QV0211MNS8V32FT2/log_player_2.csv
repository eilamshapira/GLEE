"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer doesn't seem fair to me. She's proposing to take 90% of the money while only giving me 10%. Since the money only decreases by 10% each round, I still have a good chance to propose a more equitable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more equitable division, slightly favoring myself since I'm making the offer now. I'll aim for fairness while accounting for the 10% decrease in value.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I suggest we divide the money more fairly than your initial proposal. This way we both get a substantial amount, and we avoid further rounds where the total value decreases. With this offer, you'd still receive $4,500, which is much better than risking another round and losing additional value."
