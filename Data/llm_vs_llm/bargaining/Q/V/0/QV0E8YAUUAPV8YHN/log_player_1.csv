"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'm Alice, and I'll make the first offer in this game. Given that I'm dealing with 10% inflation per round, I should make a reasonable proposal that Bob would accept to avoid further rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose we split the million dollars with me getting $550,000 and Bob getting $450,000. This is a fair offer that gives me a slight advantage as the first mover, while still offering Bob a substantial portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I see that Bob is offering a similar split to what I proposed initially, but reversed in his favor. Let me make a more balanced offer since the money is now worth less to me due to inflation (20% less value to me after two rounds).

{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000}

I propose a slightly more balanced split where I get $520,000 and Bob gets $480,000. This acknowledges the inflation effect on my side while still trying to secure a reasonable portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 460000 
# Bob gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I notice that Bob is gradually increasing his offers to me, but not by much. With the inflation now at 34.39% for me (after 4 rounds of 10% compounding inflation), I need to be more strategic. Let me make an offer that acknowledges this growing inflation pressure.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose a perfectly equal 50-50 split where I get $500,000 and Bob gets $500,000. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the inflation effect on my side, and should be more acceptable to Bob."
