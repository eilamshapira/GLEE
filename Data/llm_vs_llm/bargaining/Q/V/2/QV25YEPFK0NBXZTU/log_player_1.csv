"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me propose a fair split, considering that any delay will hurt my earnings due to the 20% inflation penalty per round.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I suggest I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000. This is a reasonable 60-40 split that accounts for the time pressure I'm under due to inflation. If Bob rejects this, in the next round the money will be worth 20% less to me, but not to him, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer because even with the 20% inflation penalty on my share, I can still aim for a better deal in the next round. With the current offer, I would only get $320,000 in effective value (due to the 20% inflation), while Bob gets $600,000. Let me make a new proposal in the next round that's more balanced."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me propose a new split, considering that my share is now worth 40% less due to inflation after two rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

I'm proposing $700,000 for me and $300,000 for Bob. Due to the 40% inflation penalty, my $700,000 is effectively worth $420,000 to me, while Bob's $300,000 maintains its full value. This creates a more balanced effective outcome, and it's important to reach an agreement soon before inflation further reduces the value of my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept this offer because with the 48.8% inflation penalty, my $450,000 would be worth effectively $230,400, and if I reject and continue to future rounds, the inflation penalty will become even more severe. While this isn't ideal, the risk of getting an even worse deal or potentially nothing (if we reach round 12 without agreement) makes this a reasonable compromise to accept now."
