"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Split it evenly, no need to wait""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly, minimizing the effect of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's make a deal. I take a bit more, you avoid the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $400,000, which is worth 5% less than its original value, so I'll effectively get 400,000 * 0.95 = $380,000.

If I reject the offer, the money will be worth even less in the next round. Since the inflation rate for me is 5%, in the next round, I'll lose another 5% of the value.

Given that Bob's offer gives me a significant amount, and considering the risk of further inflation, I think it's a reasonable deal.

My response:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
