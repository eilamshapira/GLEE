Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 42

This offer is still heavily skewed in Alice's favor, even considering the inflation.  I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal."

The inflation is starting to hurt, but this offer is still not acceptable.  Alice needs to realize she is losing negotiating power much faster than I am."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35} 

It's getting late in the game, I need to push a bit harder, but I still think there's room for Alice to accept and get something."

This is getting ridiculous.  While the inflation is hurting me, it's clear Alice is being far more affected and she needs to start making realistic offers."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30}

This is my final offer.  Alice needs to understand the gravity of the situation with the rapidly increasing inflation."

This is cutting it close, but with only a few rounds left and inflation rapidly eating at the value, it's better to take something than risk ending up with nothing."
