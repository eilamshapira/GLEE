"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. I'm Alice, and I need to make an offer to Bob, keeping in mind the inflation that affects me.

Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

Rationale:

*   I'm starting with an offer that gives me a slightly larger share. This is because I'm factoring in the potential for future inflation eroding the value of my gains if we go to further rounds.
*   I believe this is a reasonable offer that Bob might accept, as he still gets a significant portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the new information.

Here's my decision for Round 2:

```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Rationale:

*   Bob's offer is a 50/50 split.
*   Due to inflation, the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. This means $50 is worth $45 of original money.
*   Due to inflation, the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. This means $50 is worth $40 of original money.
*   Accepting ensures I get $45 of the original money. Rejecting risks further inflation and potentially a worse offer in the next round. This risk is high given the two rounds we already passed."
