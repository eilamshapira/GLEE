"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Alice's first offer carefully. She's proposing I get $400,000 while she takes $600,000. This is a 40/60 split in her favor.

Since we're only in the first round and have plenty of rounds remaining, I believe I can make a counter-offer that would be more favorable to me. If I reject, I'll be able to make my own proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a slightly more balanced offer to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

This is a fair 50/50 split of the money, which would give us both an equal share. It's a reasonable counter-offer that respects both of our interests."
