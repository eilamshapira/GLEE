"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a strategic first offer. Since Bob faces a steeper discount rate (10% vs my 5%), he has more incentive to accept an early offer. However, I don't want to be too aggressive and risk rejection.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, taking into account our different discount rates. This gives Bob a significant portion while acknowledging my advantage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. My $500,000 is now worth $475,000 (5% less)
2. Bob's $500,000 is now worth $450,000 (10% less)
3. If I reject, I can make a new offer next round, but:
   - The money will be worth even less for both of us
   - Bob might reject again, leading to further devaluation

This is actually a reasonable offer. While I got less than my initial proposal, waiting longer will only reduce the value further for both of us. The 50-50 split is fair, and considering the inflation penalties, it's better to accept now than risk further devaluation.
