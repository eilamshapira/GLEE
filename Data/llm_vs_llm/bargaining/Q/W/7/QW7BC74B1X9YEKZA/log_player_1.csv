"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split that accounts for the higher inflation penalty I face. Since I lose 10% value per round compared to Bob's 5%, I should ask for a bit more to offset potential future depreciation.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable first offer that gives both of us a substantial portion while slightly favoring me to account for my higher inflation risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Bob is offering a 50-50 split
2. Due to inflation, my $50 is now worth $45 (10% less)
3. Bob's $50 is worth $47.50 (5% less)
4. If I reject, we go to round 3 where values will decrease further
5. In round 3, my money would be worth 20% less and Bob's 10% less
6. Even if I make a better proposal in round 3, the inflation will eat into the gains

Given these factors, I should accept this offer. While not ideal, getting $45 in real value now is better than risking further depreciation.
