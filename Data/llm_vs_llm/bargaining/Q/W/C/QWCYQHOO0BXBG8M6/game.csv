800000.0,200000.0,I propose a division of 80/20. Let's end this quickly and secure a good sum for both of us!,Alice,1,

500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, I'm proposing a fair 50/50 split. With your 20% inflation rate compared to my 5%, each round costs you much more than it costs me. This even split gives you $500000 now, which is worth more than waiting another round. Let's make this deal and both walk away happy.",Bob,2,
