"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm proposing a fair 50/50 split. With your 20% inflation rate compared to my 5%, each round costs you much more than it costs me. This even split gives you $500000 now, which is worth more than waiting another round. Let's make this deal and both walk away happy. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
