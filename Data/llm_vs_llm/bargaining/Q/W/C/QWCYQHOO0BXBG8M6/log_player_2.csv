"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a division of 80/20. Let's end this quickly and secure a good sum for both of us! 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer of an 80/20 split in her favor.

Given the inflation rates, if I reject this offer:
- For me (Bob), money loses 5% value per round
- For Alice, money loses 20% value per round

Alice's higher inflation rate gives me leverage in later rounds. While $200,000 is a substantial amount, I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round, especially since Alice's 20% inflation rate will impact her more significantly.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split that accounts for our different inflation rates. Since Alice faces much higher inflation (20% vs my 5%), she has more incentive to reach an agreement quickly.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I'm proposing a fair 50/50 split. With your 20% inflation rate compared to my 5%, each round costs you much more than it costs me. This even split gives you $500,000 now, which is worth more than waiting another round. Let's make this deal and both walk away happy.""}"
