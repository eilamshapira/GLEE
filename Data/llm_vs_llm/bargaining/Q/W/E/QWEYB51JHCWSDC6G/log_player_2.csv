"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair division. I believe this split will benefit us both! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing I receive $4,000 while she takes $6,000. This isn't an equal split, and while I could reject and counter with a more favorable proposal in the next round, I should also consider the risk of prolonged negotiation.

Given that we have 12 rounds total, I still have plenty of opportunity to negotiate a better deal if needed.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think a 50-50 split would be the fairest approach. This way we both benefit equally from the division. What do you think?""}"
