"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer. We both want to maximize our gains, and this offer gives us both more than your last proposal.  Let's not waste time with further rounds. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While it's not ideal compared to my initial proposal, the 5% inflation penalty means waiting longer will reduce the real value of any future gains. A $45 share now is better than risking further rounds with diminishing returns."
