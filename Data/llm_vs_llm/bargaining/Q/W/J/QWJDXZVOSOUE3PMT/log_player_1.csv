"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to propose a split of $10,000, keeping in mind the diminishing value of the money for me due to inflation, while Bob's value remains constant. To start, I'll offer a split that is slightly in my favor, but still fair enough to encourage Bob to accept.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob's offer gives me $4000, but that $4000 is worth 10% less than it would have been in Round 1. That means it's worth $3600 to me now. Bob gets $6000.

To decide, I need to consider how much the money will be worth in future rounds and the risk of getting nothing if we reach round 13. I will reject and try to get a better offer next round.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's my turn to propose again. This time, I need to factor in that my money is now worth 20% less than in the first round. I'll propose a split that gives me a slightly larger share to compensate for the inflation, but still attractive enough for Bob to accept.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6200,
  ""bob_gain"": 3800
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Alright, Bob is driving a hard bargain. He's offering me $3500, but that's worth 27.1% less to me now. So, $3500 * (1 - 0.271) = $2551.50 in initial value. He gets $6500.

I'm getting significantly less, and inflation continues to eat away at my potential earnings. I need to weigh the risk of getting nothing against accepting this offer. I'm still going to reject and try to get a better offer next round, since accepting this offer is too detrimental.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, this is getting risky. My money is losing value fast. I'll try to make a more compelling offer to Bob, while still trying to get a reasonable amount for myself. The inflation is now 34.39%.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6800,
  ""bob_gain"": 3200
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob is really pushing for a bigger share. He's offering me $3000, but with 40.95% inflation, that's worth only $3000 * (1 - 0.4095) = $1771.50 in initial value. He gets $7000.

This is a terrible offer for me, considering the initial value. But we're halfway through the rounds, and the risk of getting nothing is increasing. I'm going to reject and propose a fairer split.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Alright, this is getting critical. I'm losing value rapidly due to inflation, now at 46.86%. I need to make a much more enticing offer to Bob while ensuring I still get something worthwhile. I will offer a near 50-50 split adjusted for the inflation I've suffered so far.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7200,
  ""bob_gain"": 2800
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","This is an extremely unfavorable offer. Bob is offering me $2500, which, with 52.17% inflation, is worth only $2500 * (1 - 0.5217) = $1195.75 in initial value. Meanwhile, he gets $7500.

With only 4 rounds left, and the significant loss I'm incurring due to inflation, the risk of getting nothing is becoming very real. However, $1195.75 is a very low return. I will reject, but I will aim for a much safer proposal next round, if it is given to me.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I'm in a very tough spot. Inflation is at 56.95%. I need to make an offer that Bob will *definitely* accept, even if it means I get relatively little. I will now offer a very large amount to Bob.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
