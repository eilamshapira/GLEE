"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: I get $50, Alice gets $50
2. If I reject:
   * Next round: I can make an offer
   * But money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Alice
   * My $50 would become worth $45
   * Alice's $50 would become worth $40

Since this is a fair split and waiting would reduce the value for both of us (with Alice losing even more value), this seems like a reasonable offer to accept. While I could try to negotiate for more in the next round, the depreciation in value makes this current 50-50 split attractive.
