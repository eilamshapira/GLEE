"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share, let's agree 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is proposing that I get $40 while she gets $60, which isn't an equal split. While she calls it a ""fair share,"" I think we can reach a more equitable arrangement, especially since I'll be making the next proposal if I reject. With 10% inflation per round, the total value will be $90 in the next round, but I can propose a better distribution for myself.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split while acknowledging the inflation factor.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""I propose an equal 50-50 split, which is fair for both of us. If we go to another round, we'll both lose due to 10% inflation.""}"
