Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a fair 50-50 split for both of us. Let's agree quickly to avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 10% inflation, $5000 is now worth $4500 to me. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, any amount I get will be worth 20% less due to inflation. So even if I managed to get $6000 in the next round, it would only be worth $4800 to me.

Since Bob's offering me $5000 (worth $4500 with current inflation), and there's risk of further losses if we continue negotiating, I should accept this offer.
