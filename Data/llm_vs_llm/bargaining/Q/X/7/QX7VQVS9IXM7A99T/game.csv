600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Since we both face decreasing value with each round (20% for me, and possibly for you too), it's best to agree quickly. This is fair considering we both want to maximize our share while avoiding delays that reduce the overall value.",Alice,1,
