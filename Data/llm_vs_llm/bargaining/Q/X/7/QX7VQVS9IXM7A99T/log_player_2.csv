"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Since we both face decreasing value with each round (20% for me, and possibly for you too), it's best to agree quickly. This is fair considering we both want to maximize our share while avoiding delays that reduce the overall value. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Current split offered: 400,000$ for me, 600,000$ for Alice (40-60 split)
2. If I reject, next round I can make a counter-offer, but:
   - The money will be worth 5% less to me
   - 400,000$ now is better than potentially getting more that's worth less
   - The inflation rate for Alice is unknown, could be different
3. A 40% share is substantial, and avoiding inflation is important
4. The risk of negotiating further might not be worth the potential gain

Given the certainty of getting 400,000$ now versus the risk of getting less value in future rounds due to inflation, I should accept this offer.
