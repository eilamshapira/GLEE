"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a fair offer considering our different inflation penalties.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and you get $45. This is a reasonable split since you face higher inflation (10%) than I do (5%) if we delay. A quick agreement benefits us both, but especially you."
