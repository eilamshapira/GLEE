"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. I'm being offered $45 while Alice takes $55
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer, but:
   - The money will be worth 10% less to me (so $100 becomes worth $90)
   - For Alice, it will only be worth 5% less ($95)
3. A fairly even split early in the game might be better than trying to negotiate for more while losing value

While I could try to negotiate for a 50-50 split, the cost of delay (10% for me vs 5% for Alice) puts me at a disadvantage in prolonged negotiations. $45 is a reasonable offer in round 1, considering these factors.
