"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly down the middle, Bob. 500000 for each of us. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether accepting this offer is the best decision.

Alice is offering a 50-50 split, which gives me $500,000. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation, making the total effectively worth $900,000 to me in the next round.

If I reject and counter-offer in the next round, even if I ask for more (say $600,000), Alice might reject, and we'd go to a third round with 20% total inflation for me, further reducing the value.

A fair split now seems better than risking further rounds with increasing inflation.
