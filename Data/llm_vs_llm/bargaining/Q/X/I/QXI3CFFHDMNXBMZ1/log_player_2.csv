"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose an even 50-50 split of the $100. By finalizing now, we both secure our share without risking any potential inflation effects. Letâ€™s agree and wrap this up quickly! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering a 50-50 split ($50 each)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, $50 in the next round would be worth $47.50 to me
4. If I try to get more in the next round, Alice might reject, leading to even more inflation losses
5. A fair split now is better than risking losses from inflation

The 50-50 split is fair, and the inflation penalty makes waiting risky.
