"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40. A fair deal for both of us, considering the circumstances. Accept now! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $4,000 (40%) while keeping $6,000 (60%)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 20% inflation, any amount I get next round will be worth 20% less to me
4. If I got $5,000 next round (50%), it would only be worth $4,000 to me due to inflation
5. This means Alice's current offer of $4,000 is actually quite reasonable

Given that inflation will reduce the value of any future gains, and this is a decent first offer, I should accept.
