"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my first offer to divide the $10,000. Since I'm affected by inflation with each round, I should be mindful of that when making my proposal.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose a 50-50 split, which I believe is fair for both of us. This way we can both walk away with a significant amount rather than risk inflation reducing our gains in future rounds."
