"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically:

1. It's a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
2. However, if I reject now, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. The 5% inflation means my $5000 would be worth $4750 next round
4. If I try to negotiate for more, Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to further inflation losses
5. Given we have 12 rounds maximum, the risk of prolonged negotiation could significantly reduce the value
6. A 50-50 split in the first round avoids any inflation loss

Given these factors, especially that it's a fair split with no inflation loss, I'll accept.
