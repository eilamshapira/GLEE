Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Let's calculate the actual value of the offer due to inflation:

Original value of the offer: $150,000
Inflation after 4 rounds: 1 - 0.05^4 = 0.8145 (or 18.55% less)

Actual value of the offer after inflation: 150000 * 0.8145 = $122,175

Since the value of the money I gain is decreasing with each round due to inflation, it makes sense to reject the offer and hope for a better deal in the next round. However, I should be aware that the value of the money will continue to decrease with each round, so I should be prepared to accept a reasonable offer soon."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

Justification: Given the impact of inflation, it's crucial to secure a higher amount sooner rather than later. Offering Alice $400,000 might be reasonable enough for her to accept, considering the decreasing value of money over rounds."
