"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $400,000 while she gets $600,000.

Given that:
1. This is just the first round, so I have many opportunities to counter
2. The split (40/60) isn't terribly unfair, but I believe I can get better
3. There's no inflation effect for me, so I don't lose value by waiting
4. I have bargaining power with 11 more rounds available

I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the offer.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

This is a reasonable counteroffer that gives me a bit more than half while still leaving Alice with a substantial amount. It's not so extreme that it should trigger an automatic rejection, and it leaves room for negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze Alice's new offer:

1. She's offering me $450,000, which is better than her first offer of $400,000
2. She wants $550,000, but due to inflation, it's actually worth 19% less to her (effectively about $445,500)
3. There's no inflation impact on my side, so I would get the full $450,000
4. We still have 9 rounds left, but the inflation is significantly impacting Alice's position
5. This is actually a pretty fair offer considering the inflation effect

Given that the real value split is now almost equal (slightly in my favor due to inflation on her side), and that continuing might lead to more value destruction for Alice without benefiting me, I'll accept this offer.
