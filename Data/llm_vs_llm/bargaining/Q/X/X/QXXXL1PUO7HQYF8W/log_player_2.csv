"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, I need to push for a better split.  Alice's offer is getting closer to reasonable, but the inflation is working against me more strongly than her.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to try and secure a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my desired share slightly. This signals that I'm serious about getting a larger portion due to the inflation disadvantage, but it's still within a range that might be tempting for Alice to accept rather than risk further devaluation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 58 
# Alice gain: 42 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This offer is now within an acceptable range considering the inflation working against me.  While I'd prefer a higher split, waiting longer risks a worse outcome as the money continues to devalue more significantly for me."
