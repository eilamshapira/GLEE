  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's split the money fairly. I'm proposing a 55/45 split, giving me $5500 and you $4500. This is a generous offer and ensures we both walk away with a good amount before inflation hits. What do you say?""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way for both of us. This way, we both get an equal share before inflation affects the total amount. Let's make this a win-win situation! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
