Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split the money fairly. I'm proposing a 55/45 split, giving me $5500 and you $4500. This is a generous offer and ensures we both walk away with a good amount before inflation hits. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
