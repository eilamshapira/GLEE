20.95,79.05,"Hi Bob, let’s settle now. In round 1 the full $100 is available. I’m offering you $79.05—if you wait another round your share would effectively be worth about $79.05 anyway because of the 5% discount—and I get $20.95. Accepting now avoids further loss in value for both of us. What do you say?",Alice,1,
