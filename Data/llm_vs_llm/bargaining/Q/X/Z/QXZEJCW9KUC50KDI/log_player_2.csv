"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically. 

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the total amount will be worth 5% less (950,000$). To come out ahead, I would need to secure significantly more than $400,000 of that reduced amount, and Alice would need to accept.

The current offer gives me $400,000, which is 40% of the total. While not an even split, it's still a substantial amount, and accepting now avoids the risk of further devaluation.

Given the inflation penalty and the uncertainty of Alice accepting a more favorable counter-offer, I'll accept this offer.
