"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since Bob has the power to accept/reject.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable first offer that gives both of us a substantial portion while accounting for the fact that Bob can counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. The money I would get ($45) is worth 5% less due to inflation, so it's effectively worth $42.75 to me
2. If I reject, I can make a new offer next round, but that money will be worth even less (10% less than original)
3. Bob might continue to be tough in negotiations, and we only have 10 rounds left
4. The split is not terribly unfair, and getting something is better than risking getting nothing

Given these factors, I'll accept this offer.
