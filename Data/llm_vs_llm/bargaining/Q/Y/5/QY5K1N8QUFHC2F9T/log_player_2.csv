"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start strong, Bob! I think this is a fair split to get us started. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me 4000$ while taking 6000$ for herself. 

If I reject, the money will be worth 10% less for me next round (but 20% less for her). However, I'll get to make the next proposal.

Given that:
1. This is a 40/60 split, which isn't terrible but could be better
2. Alice will lose more value (20%) than me (10%) if we go to the next round
3. I'll have the advantage of making the next proposal
4. We still have plenty of rounds left

I think I can get a better deal by rejecting this and making my own proposal next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice will lose 20% value per round compared to my 10%, I'll propose a more balanced split while emphasizing our mutual interest in reaching an agreement soon.
