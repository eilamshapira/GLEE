5200.0,4800.0,"Hi Bob, to avoid any potential downsides from waiting (and possible inflation effects on your side), I propose we settle now. I'll take $5200 and you receive $4800. I believe this division fairly reflects our shared interests in concluding the game swiftly. Let me know your thoughts!",Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think I deserve a bit more. Considering the potential inflation effect on my side, I'd like to propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This way, we both still get a significant amount, and I'll be more comfortable with the division.",Bob,2,

9900.0,100.0,"Hi Bob, I understand you’re keen on getting the best deal possible, but with every round the impact of inflation on your share only compounds. By settling now, you ensure you get something rather than risking a much smaller value later on. With that in mind, I propose that I receive $9900 and you receive $100. I know it may look lopsided, but if you wait any longer, the effective value of what you get will drop even further—making it hard to argue for a better outcome down the line. I hope you agree that closing the deal now is in both our best interests.",Alice,3,

4000.0,6000.0,"Hi Alice, I see what you're trying to do, but I'm not ready to give up yet. Your offer is extremely one-sided, and I'm willing to take the risk of further inflation to get a better deal. I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a more reasonable division, considering the impact of inflation on my side. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
6800.0,3200.0,"Hi Bob, I know you’re aiming to secure a larger piece, but we both must consider what waiting does—further inflation will only erode the value of your share. In this round, I'm offering you $3200, which, though it may seem lower than previous proposals, is a strong guarantee against further devaluation. Accepting now means you lock in a definite value, whereas delaying exposes you to even steeper losses. I believe this offer reflects the practical reality of our situation and is in both our interests. Let’s wrap this up now before circumstances worsen.",Alice,5,

3500.0,6500.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your concern for the impact of inflation on my share, but I still believe I can get a better deal. Considering the significant difference in the value of our shares due to inflation, I'm willing to take a risk and propose a 65-35 split in my favor. This may seem aggressive, but I'm trying to compensate for the loss of value on my side. Let's see if we can find a mutually acceptable solution.",Bob,6,

3000.0,7000.0,"Hi Bob, I understand you’re aiming for a high nominal share, but we both know that each additional round only worsens the effective value of your portion. In light of that, I’m offering you $7000 now and keeping $3000 for myself. While I know this might seem close to your previous expectations in nominal terms, locking in this deal today protects you from further inflation-induced losses. I believe this is a fair compromise given our situation, so let’s wrap this up now.",Alice,7,
