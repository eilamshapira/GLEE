Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think I deserve a bit more. Considering the potential inflation effect on my side, I'd like to propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This way, we both still get a significant amount, and I'll be more comfortable with the division.

# Bob gain: 5500

Round 3

By settling now, you ensure you get something rather than risking a much smaller value later on. With that in mind, I propose that I receive $9,900 and you receive $100. I know it may look lopsided, but if you wait any longer, the effective value of what you get will drop even further—making it hard to argue for a better outcome down the line. I hope you agree that closing the deal now is in both our best interests.""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I see what you're trying to do, but I'm not ready to give up yet. Your offer is extremely one-sided, and I'm willing to take the risk of further inflation to get a better deal. I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a more reasonable division, considering the impact of inflation on my side. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.

In this round, I'm offering you $3,200, which, though it may seem lower than previous proposals, is a strong guarantee against further devaluation. Accepting now means you lock in a definite value, whereas delaying exposes you to even steeper losses. I believe this offer reflects the practical reality of our situation and is in both our interests. Let’s wrap this up now before circumstances worsen.""}"

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your concern for the impact of inflation on my share, but I still believe I can get a better deal. Considering the significant difference in the value of our shares due to inflation, I'm willing to take a risk and propose a 65-35 split in my favor. This may seem aggressive, but I'm trying to compensate for the loss of value on my side. Let's see if we can find a mutually acceptable solution.

While I know this might seem close to your previous expectations in nominal terms, locking in this deal today protects you from further inflation-induced losses. I believe this is a fair compromise given our situation, so let’s wrap this up now.""}"
