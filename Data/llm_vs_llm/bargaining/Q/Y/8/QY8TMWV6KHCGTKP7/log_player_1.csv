Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you wanted a bit more, but considering the inflation affects you more, let's meet in the middle. This is a fair split given the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
