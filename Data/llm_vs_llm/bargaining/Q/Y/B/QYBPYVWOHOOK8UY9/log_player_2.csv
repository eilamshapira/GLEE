"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer gives her more than half of the money. However, I need to consider that her money is worth 20% less each round. If I reject and the game continues, the total value for her decreases, which gives me some leverage.

Let me analyze this offer:
- I would get $400,000 (40% of the total)
- Alice would get $600,000 (60% of the total)

This isn't a very balanced split. Since inflation doesn't affect me but impacts Alice significantly, I should reject this and make a counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer considering the inflation factor for Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is fair to both of us. This gives you $500,000 and me $500,000. Since you face 20% inflation each round, it's in your interest to accept this balanced offer now rather than continue to later rounds where your share would be worth less to you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has improved her offer, now giving me $450,000 (45%) while keeping $550,000 (55%) for herself. I need to consider that:

1. Alice is now feeling the effects of inflation (36% less value for her)
2. She moved from offering me 40% to 45% of the total
3. If I reject, we move to round 4, where inflation will affect her even more
4. I still have no inflation penalty

Her offer is better, but still gives her more than half. Given the inflation pressure on her side and that I can make another counteroffer next round with even more leverage, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more favorable offer for myself while still giving Alice enough incentive to accept, considering the inflation she faces.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering you $450,000 and keeping $550,000 for myself. This is a mirror of your last offer, but now the roles are reversed. Since you're facing significant inflation (already 36% and increasing with each round), accepting this offer now preserves more value for you than waiting for future rounds. This is a reasonable compromise that acknowledges the inflation pressure you're under."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has improved her offer again, now giving me $480,000 (48%) while keeping $520,000 (52%) for herself. Let me analyze the current situation:

1. Alice is now facing severe inflation (59.04% less value for her)
2. She moved from offering me 45% to now 48% of the total
3. If I reject, we move to round 6, where inflation will affect her even more drastically
4. I still have no inflation penalty

Her offer is getting closer to equal, but she's still keeping more despite facing significant inflation. The inflation pressure on her is mounting quickly, which gives me even more leverage for the next round. I'll reject this offer and counter.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer that takes advantage of the significant inflation pressure Alice is facing while still giving her enough incentive to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I'm offering you $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. With the severe inflation you're facing (already nearly 60% and increasing with each round), the actual value you'll receive from this $400,000 is diminishing rapidly. If we continue to later rounds, your share will be worth even less to you due to the 20% compounding inflation per round. This offer gives you a significant portion while acknowledging the strategic reality of our situation. It would be rational to accept now rather than continuing to later rounds where any amount will be worth substantially less to you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 495000 
# Alice gain: 505000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has improved her offer yet again, now giving me $495,000 (49.5%) while keeping $505,000 (50.5%) for herself. Let me assess the current situation:

1. Alice is now facing extreme inflation (73.79% less value for her)
2. She's moved from offering me 48% to now 49.5% of the total
3. Her offer is very close to an even split
4. She's clearly feeling the pressure of inflation
5. I still have no inflation penalty

While this is quite close to an even split, I still have significant leverage because of Alice's inflation problem. At this point, Alice's $505,000 is only worth about $132,050 in original value to her (505,000 Ã— (1-0.7379)).

I'm going to reject this offer one more time to see if I can get an even better deal, knowing that her inflation will approach 80% in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer that strongly leverages the extreme inflation pressure Alice is facing while still giving her enough incentive to accept rather than continuing further.

{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000}

I'm offering you $350,000 and keeping $650,000 for myself. With the extreme inflation you're facing (almost 74% and climbing rapidly), this $350,000 is already significantly diminished in value for you. If we continue to later rounds, your purchasing power will erode even further due to the compounding 20% inflation per round.

At this point, a quick resolution benefits you substantially. Even though my offer gives you a smaller nominal amount, accepting now preserves what value remains. Further negotiations would only decrease the real value of any amount you eventually receive. This offer represents a realistic assessment of our negotiating positions given the severe asymmetric inflation pressure."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 510000 
# Alice gain: 490000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has now offered me $510,000 (51%) while asking for $490,000 (49%) for herself. This is a significant development - she's now offering me more than half of the total.

Let me assess this situation carefully:

1. Alice is facing devastating inflation (83.22% less value for her)
2. She's now moved to giving me the majority share (51%)
3. Her $490,000 is only worth about $82,300 in original value to her due to inflation
4. I still have no inflation penalty
5. We've completed 9 rounds, with only 3 more to go before we both get nothing

This is the first offer where I'm getting more than Alice, which is a strong indication of how the inflation is affecting her decision-making. While I could potentially get an even better deal in the next round, there's also the risk of ending up with nothing if we can't agree within the remaining rounds.

Given that I'm now being offered the majority share, I'll accept this offer.
