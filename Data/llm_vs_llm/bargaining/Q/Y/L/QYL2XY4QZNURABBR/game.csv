7000.0,3000.0,"Hi Bob! Given the 20% inflation per round for you, it's best we agree now. I'm offering you 3000$ which is more valuable than a larger sum in future rounds. If we go to the next round, the maximum value for you would be less due to inflation. This is a fair deal considering the circumstances.",Alice,1,

4000.0,6000.0,"Considering the inflation, I'd rather we settle now with a more even split. This way, we both get a decent amount, and I minimize my losses due to inflation.",Bob,2,

6000.0,4000.0,"Bob, let's be practical about this. Due to inflation, your 4000$ now is worth more than 5000$ would be in the next round (that would only be worth 4000$ to you after 20% inflation). This is a fair compromise from my previous offer, giving you more while recognizing the time pressure you face. Let's conclude this deal now so we both benefit.",Alice,3,
