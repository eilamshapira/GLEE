"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob! Given the 20% inflation per round for you, it's best we agree now. I'm offering you 3000$ which is more valuable than a larger sum in future rounds. If we go to the next round, the maximum value for you would be less due to inflation. This is a fair deal considering the circumstances.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I'd rather we settle now with a more even split. This way, we both get a decent amount, and I minimize my losses due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical about this. Due to inflation, your 4000$ now is worth more than 5000$ would be in the next round (that would only be worth 4000$ to you after 20% inflation). This is a fair compromise from my previous offer, giving you more while recognizing the time pressure you face. Let's conclude this deal now so we both benefit.""}"
