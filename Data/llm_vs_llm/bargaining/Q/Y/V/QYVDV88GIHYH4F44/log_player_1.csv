"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since this is the first round, I'll make a reasonable offer to avoid prolonging the game and minimize the effect of inflation. I'll offer a 50-50 split, which is a fair division.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly and avoid inflation losses.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's consider my proposal: $60 for me and $40 for you. It's still a good split for both of us! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $40 I would gain is actually worth $40 * 0.9 = $36 to me.

Since Bob's offer gives me less than half of the original amount (and even less considering the inflation), I think I can try to get a better deal in the next round.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 10% less than in the previous round, so it's worth 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 of the original value.

To make a competitive offer, I'll give Bob a bit less than he offered me in the previous round. I'll offer him $55 and keep $45 for myself.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground before inflation eats away more value.""
}
```"
