"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. This gives us both $5000, which is the most equitable division. If we delay, we both lose value due to inflation, with me losing more (20%) than you (10%) each round. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
