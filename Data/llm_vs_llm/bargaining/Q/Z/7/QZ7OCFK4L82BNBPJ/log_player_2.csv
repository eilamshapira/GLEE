"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable and end this quickly.  This offer gives me a slight advantage while still leaving you with a significant sum. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer gives me $350,000 and Alice $650,000
2. If I reject, the next round will have 10% inflation for me, meaning the total pot is effectively worth $900,000 to me
3. I would need to offer something that Alice would accept, but I could potentially get more than $350,000
4. However, if negotiations drag on, inflation will significantly reduce my share
5. This first offer is quite uneven (65-35 split)

Given that we have multiple rounds available and the initial offer is significantly in Alice's favor, I believe I can get a better deal even accounting for one round of inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split while acknowledging the time pressure we both face:

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. This is equitable for both of us, and we can avoid the risks of prolonged negotiation and inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer in the last round, but it's important to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. This offer ensures a larger share for me, acknowledging the risk I'm taking with inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Due to 19% inflation on my side, $400,000 would be worth about $324,000 to me now
2. Alice's previous rejection of a 50-50 split and current offer of 60-40 suggests she's willing to negotiate but wants a larger share
3. If I reject, the next round will have even more inflation (around 27% for me)
4. Alice is also experiencing significant inflation (36%), which might make her more eager to conclude
5. The offer has improved from the initial 65-35 split to 60-40
6. Further negotiations might result in diminishing returns due to increasing inflation

Given the improving terms, significant inflation already in effect, and the risk of further value loss, this seems like a reasonable compromise.
