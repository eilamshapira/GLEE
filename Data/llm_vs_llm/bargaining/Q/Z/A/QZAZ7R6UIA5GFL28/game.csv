55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I’m proposing that I get $55 and you get $45. Settling now avoids any delays or inflation issues for me, and it gives you a good share too. Let’s agree and wrap this up swiftly!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"Hi Alice, considering the inflation affecting my share, I propose $60 for me and $40 for you. This way, we both get a fair deal before the value drops further. Let's settle this round!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, in round 3 I'm proposing that I receive $55 and you get $45. While nominally this might seem close to a 50-50 split, remember that each round delays payment for you and further erodes the effective value of your share due to inflation. Right now, your $45 is effectively worth about $40.50, and any further delay will only worsen that situation. I believe this is a fair compromise given the circumstances, so let’s settle now before the inflation bites any deeper.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
35.0,65.0,"Hi Alice, given the significant impact of inflation on my share, now at nearly 10% less value, I'm proposing $65 for me and $35 for you. This offer reflects the urgency to settle before my share loses even more value. Let's agree on this and end the game.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
30.0,70.0,"Hi Bob, I understand that with every round your share loses more of its value. If we delay any further, the inflation will hit you even harder. By agreeing now with you receiving $70 and me $30, you're locking in an effective value that—assuming your share continues to devalue further—is likely better than what you'll get in later rounds. Let’s settle now and avoid further losses for you.",Alice,5,
