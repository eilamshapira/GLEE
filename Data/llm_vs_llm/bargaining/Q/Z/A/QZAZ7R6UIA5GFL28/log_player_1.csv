"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I’m proposing that I get $55 and you get $45. Settling now avoids any delays or inflation issues for me, and it gives you a good share too. Let’s agree and wrap this up swiftly!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation affecting my share, I propose $60 for me and $40 for you. This way, we both get a fair deal before the value drops further. Let's settle this round! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, in round 3 I'm proposing that I receive $55 and you get $45. While nominally this might seem close to a 50-50 split, remember that each round delays payment for you and further erodes the effective value of your share due to inflation. Right now, your $45 is effectively worth about $40.50, and any further delay will only worsen that situation. I believe this is a fair compromise given the circumstances, so let’s settle now before the inflation bites any deeper.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, given the significant impact of inflation on my share, now at nearly 10% less value, I'm proposing $65 for me and $35 for you. This offer reflects the urgency to settle before my share loses even more value. Let's agree on this and end the game. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 30, ""bob_gain"": 70, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand that with every round your share loses more of its value. If we delay any further, the inflation will hit you even harder. By agreeing now with you receiving $70 and me $30, you're locking in an effective value that—assuming your share continues to devalue further—is likely better than what you'll get in later rounds. Let’s settle now and avoid further losses for you.""}"
