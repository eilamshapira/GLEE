"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing I get $450,000 while she gets $550,000. 

While this isn't an even split, I should remember that inflation affects Alice's value by 10% each round, but doesn't affect me. If I reject and we go to the next round, Alice will value any amount 10% less.

Since this is the first round and we have 11 more potential rounds, I could propose a more favorable split for myself. The inflation pressure will increase on Alice with each round, potentially giving me more leverage.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more favorable to me while still being reasonable for Alice, considering the inflation affects her but not me.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing a fair division where I receive $550,000 and Alice receives $450,000. Since Alice faces 10% inflation per round, it's in her interest to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. This offer gives her a substantial amount while improving my position from her initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 505000 
# Alice gain: 495000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has improved her offer to me, now proposing I get $505,000 while she gets $495,000. This is a significant improvement from her initial offer of $450,000 to me.

I notice she's feeling the effects of inflation - if she had accepted my previous offer, her $450,000 would have been worth more than her current $495,000 (which is devalued by 19% inflation).

This offer is quite reasonable. I'm getting more than half, and if I reject it to push for even more, I risk Alice making a less favorable offer in future rounds or potentially reaching the 12-round limit where we both get nothing.
