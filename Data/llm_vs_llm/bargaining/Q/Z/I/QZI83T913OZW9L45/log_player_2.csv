"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. 

The offer gives me $4,000 out of $10,000, which is 40% of the total. If I reject, the value will decrease by 10% next round, but I'll get to make a counter-offer.

With 10% inflation, in the next round the total value for me would be $9,000. Even if I could get a larger share, I need to consider if it's worth the loss in value.

While the offer isn't exactly equal, $4,000 is still a significant amount. Given the inflation risk and that we have limited rounds, I shouldn't be too greedy.
