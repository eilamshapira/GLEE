Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm offering Bob a tiny amount, hoping he'll be greedy and reject, giving me the chance to make a more reasonable proposal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
It's a fair deal, and accepting it guarantees me at least something.  The risk of getting nothing in the future rounds is too high."
