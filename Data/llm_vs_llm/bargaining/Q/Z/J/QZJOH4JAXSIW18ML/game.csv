16.82,83.18,"Hi Bob – here’s my first proposal. Given that every round we wait costs me 20% of the value while you lose only 5%, I want to avoid further devaluation. Based on a backward‐induction reasoning over our 12 rounds (with the final round leaving the proposer almost all of what’s left), I believe a fair equilibrium split now would have you getting about $83.18 and me $16.82. Please accept so that we both avoid the harsher losses of delay.",Alice,1,

20.83,79.17,"Alice, as we move into round 2 the discounts start biting hard. With your 20% per round and my 5%, any delay is costly—for you especially. Based on our continuing game, if you reject this offer you’d get to propose in round 3, but even then you’d face another round of devaluation. My offer gives you a nominal $20.83, which translates into an effective value of about $16.67 for you today—exactly what you’d expect to pocket later if we follow equilibrium strategies. Let’s avoid more loss in value and settle now.",Bob,2,
