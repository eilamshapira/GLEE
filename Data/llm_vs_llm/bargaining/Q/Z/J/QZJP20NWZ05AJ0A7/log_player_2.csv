Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try to meet in the middle. This is still a reasonable split for both of us, considering the time constraints. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

I'm rejecting this offer. While it's closer to the middle ground, the inflation is hitting Alice harder than me. I think I can get a better deal in the next round."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's agree on an even split. The inflation is hurting us both. This is the fairest way to avoid further losses.

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is better than risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
