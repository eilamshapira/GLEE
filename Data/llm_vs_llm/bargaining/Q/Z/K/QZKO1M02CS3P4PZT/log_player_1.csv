Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is the last reasonable offer before I start demanding the lion's share. With inflation eroding my gains, I need a larger cut to make this worthwhile. Take it now, or regret it later. 
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is a tough decision, and it hinges on my read of Bob. He's getting increasingly desperate, but his offers haven't become drastically better. There's a chance he panics and offers a more even split as we get closer to the deadline. I'm willing to gamble that he'll crack before I do."

""message"": ""Bob, it seems like we both want to reach an agreement. I'm willing to adjust my offer slightly to account for the inflation you're experiencing. Let's close this deal.""
}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show Bob I'm flexible and willing to negotiate. This might be enough to get him to accept, considering the increasing pressure from the inflation and the approaching deadline."

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the value of the money is plummeting for me. This is the point of no return. Accept this, or we both walk away empty-handed. Choose wisely. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is getting very risky, but Bob's demands are still unreasonable. He's clearly feeling the pressure, but his offer isn't much better than his previous ones. I'm betting that he'll become more rational as we approach the final rounds."

}
```

It's time to lay my cards on the table.  I'm significantly lowering my demand, but making it clear this is non-negotiable. Bob is running out of time and will hopefully see the value in taking a reasonable deal."

# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is incredibly frustrating, but I have to hold my ground. Accepting this offer would mean getting almost nothing. There's a tiny chance Bob panics and offers a more reasonable split in the remaining rounds.  I have to gamble on that."

}

I'm softening my stance slightly, offering a bit more than last time, but keeping my tone firm. This close to the deadline, a sense of urgency and a small compromise might be what it takes to get Bob on board."

I'm going down with the ship.  Bob has shown he's unwilling to negotiate fairly.  I'd rather both of us lose than accept a deal this lopsided."
