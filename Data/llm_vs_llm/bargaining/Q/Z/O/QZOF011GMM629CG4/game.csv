600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering inflation affects me more severely (20% vs your 10%). If we delay, both of us lose value, but I lose more. Let's make a deal now that benefits us both rather than having our money devalue through multiple rounds.",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, while your inflation rate is higher, I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share than a 50-50 split. This ensures we both get more than we would if we keep rejecting offers and our money devalues. Let's end this round and split the money.",Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I appreciate your attempt at a compromise, but the split needs to account for my higher inflation rate. Let me propose 55-45 in my favor. If we continue to the next round, my money will lose 20% more value while yours only loses 10% more. This offer is more equitable considering our different inflation rates, and ensures we both walk away with substantial value before further devaluation occurs.",Alice,3,
