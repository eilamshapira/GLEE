"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob for the division of $1,000,000, taking into account the different inflation rates we face.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering inflation affects me more severely (20% vs your 10%). If we delay, both of us lose value, but I lose more. Let's make a deal now that benefits us both rather than having our money devalue through multiple rounds.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while your inflation rate is higher, I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share than a 50-50 split. This ensures we both get more than we would if we keep rejecting offers and our money devalues. Let's end this round and split the money. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your attempt at a compromise, but the split needs to account for my higher inflation rate. Let me propose 55-45 in my favor. If we continue to the next round, my money will lose 20% more value while yours only loses 10% more. This offer is more equitable considering our different inflation rates, and ensures we both walk away with substantial value before further devaluation occurs.""}"
