"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","For the first round, I'll make a reasonable offer. Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob with each passing round, it's in both of our interests to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. Considering this, I'll propose a split that slightly favors me but is still fair, hoping Bob will accept to avoid further devaluation.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, the $5000 offered to me is actually worth $5000 * 0.9 = $4500 in real value.

For Bob, the money he gains is worth 20% less, so his $5000 is actually worth $5000 * 0.8 = $4000 in real value.

Considering this, the offer seems somewhat fair, but since I'm the one who has to decide, I'll think about the potential future rounds and the further devaluation of the money.

However, since the difference in real value isn't drastically in my favor, and considering the risk of further rounds leading to even more devaluation, I'll decide to accept this offer to ensure I get a significant amount.
