"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering we both want to avoid value loss from inflation in future rounds.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the $10000 evenly. This way, we both avoid further losses from inflation and walk away with an equal share. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think through this:

1. Current offer: $5000 for me, $5000 for Bob
2. Due to 5% inflation, my $5000 is actually worth $4750 to me
3. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round:
   - I'll face another 5% inflation
   - I could propose a better split, but Bob might reject again
   - Further delays risk more value loss
4. The first offer I made was rejected, suggesting Bob is firm about wanting a more equal split
5. Current offer is reasonable and avoiding further inflation is important
