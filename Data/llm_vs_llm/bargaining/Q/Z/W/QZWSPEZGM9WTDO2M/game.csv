600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, to kick things off on a fair and efficient note given the inflation penalty each round, I propose we split the million as $600000 for me and $400000 for you. By accepting now, we both secure more value before the money devalues further. Looking forward to your response.",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Alice, considering the inflation and the value we both lose with each round, I propose a split of $550000 for me and $450000 for you. This is a fair compromise given that we're now in round 2 and the money is worth less. Let's settle this quickly to maximize our gains.",Bob,2,
