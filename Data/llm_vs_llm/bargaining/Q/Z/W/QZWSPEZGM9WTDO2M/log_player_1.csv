"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, to kick things off on a fair and efficient note given the inflation penalty each round, I propose we split the million as $600,000 for me and $400,000 for you. By accepting now, we both secure more value before the money devalues further. Looking forward to your response.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation and the value we both lose with each round, I propose a split of $550000 for me and $450000 for you. This is a fair compromise given that we're now in round 2 and the money is worth less. Let's settle this quickly to maximize our gains. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
