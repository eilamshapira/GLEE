Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to kick things off on a fair and efficient note given the inflation penalty each round, I propose we split the million as $600000 for me and $400000 for you. By accepting now, we both secure more value before the money devalues further. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000

  ""bob_gain"": 550000,

  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering the inflation and the value we both lose with each round, I propose a split of $550,000 for me and $450,000 for you. This is a fair compromise given that we're now in round 2 and the money is worth less. Let's settle this quickly to maximize our gains.""
