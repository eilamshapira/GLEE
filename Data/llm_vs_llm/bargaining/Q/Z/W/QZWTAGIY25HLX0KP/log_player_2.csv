"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer is somewhat in her favor, as she's proposing to take $5,500 while giving me $4,500. If I reject, I'll get to make a counter-offer in the next round, but the total amount will be worth 10% less (so only $9,000 total). 

Since I'd need to offer Alice at least around $4,000 in the next round to be fair (and she might still reject), my potential gain by rejecting is limited and risky. The current offer gives me $4,500, which is a substantial amount even if not perfectly equal.
