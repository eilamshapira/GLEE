"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's first offer carefully. She is offering me $400,000 while taking $600,000 for herself. 

If I reject this offer, I can make a counter-proposal in the next round, but I have to consider that the money will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation. So the full $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $950,000 to me in the next round.

Since I'd be getting $400,000 now, versus potentially more in the next round but subject to 5% inflation, I'll make my decision.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that's fair but accounts for the inflation I'm experiencing.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing an equal split of the money. Since I'm experiencing 5% inflation per round, this equal division is reasonable and fair to both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Alice has now offered an equal split of $500,000 each. I also learn that Alice is experiencing much higher inflation than I am - her money is worth 36% less than in round 1, while mine is only worth 9.75% less.

Given this information, accepting this offer makes sense for me. If I reject and we go to another round, my inflation will continue, and I might not get a better offer considering Alice's severe inflation pressure.
