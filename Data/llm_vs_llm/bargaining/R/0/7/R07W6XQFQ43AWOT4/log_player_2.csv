"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This seems like a fair deal at face value. However, since I don't know how inflation affects Alice, there's a chance I could get a better deal in a later round. It's a risk to reject, but the potential reward seems worth it at this stage."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I'm aiming for a slightly better split in my favor. Let's see how Alice responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is slightly better for me than her last one, but the inflation is starting to hurt. However, it also seems like Alice is less affected by inflation than I am. I need to push for a more significant advantage while I still have some leverage."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35}

I'm increasing my demand to try and make up for the inflation losses. Let's see if Alice is willing to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

While not ideal, the effects of inflation are becoming too significant to ignore. Accepting this offer guarantees me something, whereas continuing to hold out carries the risk of getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement."
