"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1, taking into consideration the inflation affecting me:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

My reasoning is that I'm proposing first, and I need to account for the potential inflation if Bob rejects the offer. I'm aiming for a deal that's beneficial to me but also reasonable enough for Bob to accept, avoiding a potentially worse outcome for both of us due to the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to carefully consider this offer, taking into account the inflation that has impacted both me and Bob.

Here's the breakdown:

*   **Original Amount:** $10,000

*   **Value of Money for Me (Alice):** Worth 5% less than Round 1.

*   **Value of Money for Bob:** Worth 10% less than Round 1.

Bob is offering me $4500. Let's analyze:

*   Accepting means I get $4500 now, which is worth 5% less than what $4500 was worth in Round 1.
*   Rejecting means I get to make an offer in Round 3, but the money will be worth even less due to further inflation.

Given that inflation is affecting both of us, and Bob's offer is relatively close to a 50/50 split (considering the inflation impact on Bob), I will accept the offer to avoid further losses.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
