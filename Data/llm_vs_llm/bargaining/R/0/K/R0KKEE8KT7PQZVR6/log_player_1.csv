"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make my first offer to Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose that I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a fair division that gives me a slight advantage as the first mover, but still leaves Bob with a significant portion. Given the 20% inflation penalty per round, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's fair 50-50 split. Even with the 20% inflation penalty for me, getting $50 now (worth $40 to me after inflation) is better than continuing to negotiate while the value continues to decrease. This is a reasonable compromise that allows us both to walk away with a fair share."
