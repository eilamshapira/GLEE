"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a split that accounts for the different inflation rates affecting both players. Since Bob's money loses value faster (20% per round) compared to my 5% loss, I should offer a reasonable amount to encourage early acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I suggest this 60-40 split because:
1. It's a fair offer that gives Bob a significant portion
2. If Bob rejects, his share will be worth 20% less next round
3. It's better for both of us to reach an agreement quickly due to inflation"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept Bob's offer now:
   * I get $4000 at 95% value = $3800 effective value
   * Bob gets $6000 at 80% value = $4800 effective value

2. If I reject and make a new offer next round:
   * Values will decrease further (mine by 5%, Bob's by 20%)
   * I could propose a different split, but Bob might reject again
   * Another round of rejection would significantly reduce the total value for both of us

Given that:
- The effective values are relatively balanced ($3800 vs $4800)
- Further delays will reduce value for both of us
- I have no guarantee of getting a better deal in future rounds
