"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer to divide the $1,000,000, keeping in mind that with each passing round, the money becomes 20% less valuable to me due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose that I receive $600,000 and Bob receives $400,000. This is a 60/40 split that gives both of us a substantial amount while acknowledging that I need to secure a good deal now since inflation will reduce the value of my share if we continue to further rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer, considering that we're now in round 3 and the inflation effect has increased (the money is worth 40% less to me than in round 1).

{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}

I propose I receive $650,000 and Bob receives $350,000. I need to increase my share to compensate for the inflation effect I'm experiencing. This is still a reasonable split that gives Bob a significant portion while accounting for the fact that each round makes the money less valuable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
