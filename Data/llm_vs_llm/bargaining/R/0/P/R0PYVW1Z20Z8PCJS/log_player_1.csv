"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer to divide $1,000,000 with Bob.

Given that each round makes the money worth 20% less to me due to inflation, I should offer a fair division that Bob would likely accept, rather than risk moving to another round.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose an even 50-50 split which I think is fair and should be acceptable to Bob."
