"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer gives me 4,000$ and Alice 6,000$ of the total 10,000$. While it's less than half, I need to consider if it's worth rejecting and making a counter-offer, especially since inflation doesn't affect my value (0% mentioned in the rules).

I'll make a counter-offer in the next round, hoping for a more equitable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more balanced division that still acknowledges Alice's initial position.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I propose an equal 50-50 split of the $10,000, where we each receive $5,000. This is a fair division that maximizes our combined welfare."
