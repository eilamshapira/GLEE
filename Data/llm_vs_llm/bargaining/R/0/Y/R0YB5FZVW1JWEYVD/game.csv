5500.0,4500.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a slightly higher share for me because I'm affected by 10% inflation each round. If we both aim for fairness, we can resolve this quickly. This is a reasonable split that acknowledges our situation.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Let's be fair and split it equally. This way, we both get the same amount, and we can avoid further rounds and potential losses due to inflation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5800.0,4200.0,"Bob, I need to reject equal splits because of the 10% inflation that affects only my side each round. My $5000 from your offer would actually be worth only $4500 to me after inflation. This new proposal accounts for the inflation disadvantage I face. Let's resolve this now before inflation erodes more value.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I need to ensure I get a fair share as well. Let's settle this before the rounds run out. This offer gives you more than what you would have gained in the first round after 4 rounds of inflation.",Bob,4,

6100.0,3900.0,"Bob, the inflation is really hurting my position. With each round, I lose 10% of my value. By round 5, I'm already facing over 30% total loss. If we continue, I'll need increasingly larger nominal amounts just to maintain actual value. This offer gives me $6100, which after inflation is worth about $4200 to me - less than half the total real value. Please consider accepting so we can both walk away with something substantial.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"Alice, I'm willing to give you the 6000$ you asked for in the previous round. Considering 5 rounds of inflation 34.39%, the actual value is $4226.46. This way, we can both walk away with a fair share before the rounds run out.",Bob,6,
