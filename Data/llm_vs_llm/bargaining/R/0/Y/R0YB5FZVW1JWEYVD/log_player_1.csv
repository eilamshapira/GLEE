""bob_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Bob, I need to reject equal splits because of the 10% inflation that affects only my side each round. My $5000 from your offer would actually be worth only $4500 to me after inflation. This new proposal accounts for the inflation disadvantage I face. Let's resolve this now before inflation erodes more value.""}"

If we continue, I'll need increasingly larger nominal amounts just to maintain actual value. This offer gives me $6100, which after inflation is worth about $4200 to me - less than half the total real value. Please consider accepting so we can both walk away with something substantial.""}"
