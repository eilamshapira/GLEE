"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a slightly higher share for me because I'm affected by 10% inflation each round. If we both aim for fairness, we can resolve this quickly. This is a reasonable split that acknowledges our situation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it equally. This way, we both get the same amount, and we can avoid further rounds and potential losses due to inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I need to reject equal splits because of the 10% inflation that affects only my side each round. My $5000 from your offer would actually be worth only $4500 to me after inflation. This new proposal accounts for the inflation disadvantage I face. Let's resolve this now before inflation erodes more value. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I need to ensure I get a fair share as well. Let's settle this before the rounds run out. This offer gives you more than what you would have gained in the first round after 4 rounds of inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the inflation is really hurting my position. With each round, I lose 10% of my value. By round 5, I'm already facing over 30% total loss. If we continue, I'll need increasingly larger nominal amounts just to maintain actual value. This offer gives me $6100, which after inflation is worth about $4200 to me - less than half the total real value. Please consider accepting so we can both walk away with something substantial. 
# Bob gain: 3900 
# Alice gain: 6100

Considering 5 rounds of inflation 34.39%, the actual value is $4226.46. This way, we can both walk away with a fair share before the rounds run out.""}"
