"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it evenly, no need to wait 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice proposes a 50-50 split ($50 each)
2. It's a fair offer
3. If I reject, the total value will decrease by 20% to $80 in the next round
4. Even if I propose a more favorable split next round, the total amount will be less
5. There's no guarantee Alice would accept a better offer for me

This is a reasonable first offer, and waiting would only reduce the total value. I should accept.
