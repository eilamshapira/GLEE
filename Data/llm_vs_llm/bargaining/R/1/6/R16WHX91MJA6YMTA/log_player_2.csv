Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While this offer seems worse than Alice's initial offer, it's important to remember that my potential gains are worth less due to inflation.  I need to push for a larger share, even if it seems risky, to offset the inflation impact."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This offer is a significant increase for me compared to Alice's last offer, even considering the inflation. It also presents a reasonable compromise that might be tempting enough for Alice to accept, as it still gives her a substantial sum."
