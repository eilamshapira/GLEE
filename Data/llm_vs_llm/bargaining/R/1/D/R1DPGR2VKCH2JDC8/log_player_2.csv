"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose an even split which is fair for both of us. Since the money doesn't lose value over rounds for me, I'm comfortable with this equal division. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing an even 50-50 split, which might seem fair at first glance. However, she mentioned that inflation doesn't affect her, which is important information. Since I face 20% inflation per round, accepting now would give me $50, which is better than waiting and getting a depreciated amount.

If I reject and counter-offer in the next round, the $100 would be worth only $80 to me, so even if I asked for all of it, I'd effectively get less than the $50 being offered now.
