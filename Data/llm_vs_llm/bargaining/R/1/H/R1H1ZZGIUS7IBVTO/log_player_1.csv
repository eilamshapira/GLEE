"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to think strategically here. Since I'm facing inflation of 20% each round, I want to reach an agreement quickly. However, I also want a fair share. If Bob rejects my offer, the $100 will be worth only $80 to me in the next round.

I'll start with a slightly favorable offer for myself, but not too extreme to increase chances of acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40}

I suggest this split because it gives both of us a substantial portion, with a slight advantage to me as the first mover. Bob, if we can agree now, we'll both walk away with a good amount rather than risk further inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 52 
# Bob gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Bob's offer.

If I accept Bob's offer now, I'll get $52, but due to 20% inflation for me, it's only worth $52 Ã— 0.8 = $41.6 in round 1 terms.

If I reject and make a counteroffer in round 3, the money will face another 20% inflation for me (worth 64% of original value). Even if I could get a higher nominal amount, the inflation would significantly reduce its value.

Since Bob's offer of $52 (worth $41.6 to me now) is fairly reasonable considering the inflation penalty I'm facing, and rejecting would reduce the value further, I should accept.
