Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, consider that waiting another round will cost you 5% off your dollars, whereas accepting now locks in their full value. I’m offering you $1—which, while obviously a token, is the minimum to guarantee you something rather than a devalued outcome in the next round. Please accept this offer so we can conclude promptly. 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every additional round chips away at the purchasing power of your dollars—by now, your share would be discounted by over 14%. If you reject this offer, you'll face an even harsher outcome when it's your turn to propose next, and you'll end up conceding almost everything to me in order to get Bob to agree. Accepting $10000 now, even after the discount, is far better than risking a near zero outcome later. Let's settle and move on. 
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, time is painfully against you now. With your dollars devalued to about 77% of their original worth (a 22.6% loss) by this round, any further delay will only erode your gains even more. I’m offering you a nominal $350000—an effective value of roughly $270000 in round‐1 terms—which is the best you can secure given the steep discount you'll incur if we prolong the negotiations. Accept this offer and let’s conclude on these realistic terms. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough decision, and I'm unhappy with how much Bob is getting. However, waiting any longer will likely result in an even worse outcome for me. Bob is clearly exploiting the inflation to his advantage, and I need to cut my losses. Accepting $350,000 now is better than risking an even lower offer in the future."
