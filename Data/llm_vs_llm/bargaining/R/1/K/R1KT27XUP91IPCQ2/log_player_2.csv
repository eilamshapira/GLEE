"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money almost evenly, considering the inflation. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 999999, ""alice_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Alice, consider that waiting another round will cost you 5% off your dollars, whereas accepting now locks in their full value. I’m offering you $1—which, while obviously a token, is the minimum to guarantee you something rather than a devalued outcome in the next round. Please accept this offer so we can conclude promptly.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the time pressure, but your last offer was exploitative. This is my final offer, and it's more than fair considering the inflation. Let's close this out. 
# Bob gain: 510000 
# Alice gain: 490000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 990000, ""alice_gain"": 10000, ""message"": ""Alice, every additional round chips away at the purchasing power of your dollars—by now, your share would be discounted by over 14%. If you reject this offer, you'll face an even harsher outcome when it's your turn to propose next, and you'll end up conceding almost everything to me in order to get Bob to agree. Accepting $10,000 now, even after the discount, is far better than risking a near zero outcome later. Let's settle and move on.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear you're trying to pressure me, but I'm not giving in. This is my final offer. It's a significant amount of money, even with the inflation. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Alice, time is painfully against you now. With your dollars devalued to about 77% of their original worth (a 22.6% loss) by this round, any further delay will only erode your gains even more. I’m offering you a nominal $350,000—an effective value of roughly $270,000 in round‐1 terms—which is the best you can secure given the steep discount you'll incur if we prolong the negotiations. Accept this offer and let’s conclude on these realistic terms.""}"
