"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll offer a division that takes into account the inflation factor affecting Bob over time.

{""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Hi Bob! Since we both lose if we don't reach an agreement, and your money loses 10% value each round, this is a fair split considering the time pressure. You'd get less in future rounds due to inflation, so this is a good deal for both of us.""}"
