"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split where I get $550k and you get $450k. Note that inflation will reduce our money's value by 5% each round, so we both benefit from reaching an agreement soon. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $450,000, which is slightly less than half.
2. If I reject and wait for next round, my money will be worth 20% less, meaning:
   - If I get $500,000 next round, it would only be worth $400,000 to me
3. $450,000 now is better than potentially getting more in future rounds due to the inflation penalty
4. The offer is reasonably fair, and starting a back-and-forth negotiation could lead to both of us losing value
