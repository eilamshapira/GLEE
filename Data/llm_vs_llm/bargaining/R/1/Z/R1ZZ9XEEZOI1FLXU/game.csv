450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we settle the division in round 1 to avoid the 20% inflation hit I'll face in later rounds. I suggest 450K for me and 550K for you—giving you a slight edge for being patient if needed. Let’s finish this quickly and fairly; I hope you agree.",Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, considering the inflation impact on you, I think a 60-40 split in my favor would be more appropriate. This way, we can still conclude the deal quickly, and you can secure a significant amount before the money loses more value for you.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer. Given that every round further devalues my share by 20%, accepting 400K now is a pragmatic choice to secure a solid amount. Let's conclude the division here.",Alice,2,accept
