"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we settle the division in round 1 to avoid the 20% inflation hit I'll face in later rounds. I suggest 450K for me and 550K for you—giving you a slight edge for being patient if needed. Let’s finish this quickly and fairly; I hope you agree.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, considering the inflation impact on you, I think a 60-40 split in my favor would be more appropriate. This way, we can still conclude the deal quickly, and you can secure a significant amount before the money loses more value for you. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer. Given that every round further devalues my share by 20%, accepting 400K now is a pragmatic choice to secure a solid amount. Let's conclude the division here.""}"
