"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we settle the division in round 1 to avoid the 20% inflation hit I'll face in later rounds. I suggest 450K for me and 550K for you—giving you a slight edge for being patient if needed. Let’s finish this quickly and fairly; I hope you agree. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Let's see if Alice can provide a better offer. Since there is no inflation on my side, I can negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, considering the inflation impact on you, I think a 60-40 split in my favor would be more appropriate. This way, we can still conclude the deal quickly, and you can secure a significant amount before the money loses more value for you.""}"
