"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, taking inflation into account, I need to offer Bob enough to be worthwhile, considering his 20% loss per round. I also need to secure a reasonable amount for myself, given my 5% loss per round. I'll try to be more generous this time.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is becoming less appealing. My worth is 14.26% less and Bob's is 48.8% less. However, if I reject this, my potential gain in the next round will be even less. Let me calculate the actual values.

Alice's gain worth: 35 * (1 - 0.1426) = 35 * 0.8574 = 29.999
Bob's gain worth: 65 * (1 - 0.488) = 65 * 0.512 = 33.28

I think that I can do better in round 5, so I'll reject it and make him a better offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, time to make a decision.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's calculate the worth of the current offer, taking inflation into account:

Alice's gain worth: 30 * (1 - 0.2262) = 30 * 0.7738 = 23.214
Bob's gain worth: 70 * (1 - 0.6723) = 70 * 0.3277 = 22.939

If I reject, my money will worth 5% less, so in total 26.5% less than in the first round.
Let's accept this, it's getting dangerous.
