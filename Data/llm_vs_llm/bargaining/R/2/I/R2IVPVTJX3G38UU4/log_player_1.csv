"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a strategic first offer, considering that both players face inflation penalties but Bob's penalty is higher (20% vs 5% per round). Since Bob faces steeper inflation, he has more incentive to accept an early offer.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This is a reasonable first offer where I get 60% and Bob gets 40%. I'm offering Bob a substantial portion while still maintaining an advantage for myself. If Bob rejects this, the money will be worth less for both of us in the next round, especially for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

If I accept Bob's offer:
- I get $4000, but with 5% inflation, it's worth $3800
- Bob gets $6000, but with 20% inflation, it's worth $4800

If I reject and make a new offer next round:
- Further inflation will apply (I'll lose another 5%, Bob another 20%)
- I could propose a better split, but Bob might reject again
- After multiple rounds, the total value could decrease significantly for both

Since Bob's offer gives me a reasonable amount and the inflation penalties are increasing, it's better to secure a deal now rather than risk further devaluation.
