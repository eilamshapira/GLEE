"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","This seems like a fair offer from Alice. She's proposing an equal split of the $10,000, with each of us getting $5,000. Since there's no penalty for me from inflation (it's stated that the money is worth 0% less for me with each passing round), there's no strategic advantage to rejecting and making a counter-offer.
