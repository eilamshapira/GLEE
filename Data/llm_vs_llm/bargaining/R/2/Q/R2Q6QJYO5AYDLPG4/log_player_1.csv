Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair.  Let's be reasonable and get this done. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer is worth 5% less to him in each round, and this is the third round, the total amount he's willing to accept should be decreasing. Considering this, I'll make a new offer.
