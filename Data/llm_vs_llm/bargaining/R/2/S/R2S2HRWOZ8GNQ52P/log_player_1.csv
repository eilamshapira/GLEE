"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll calculate a fair proposal for Bob considering our different inflation rates. Since the money is worth 5% less to me each round, but 20% less to Bob, delaying agreement is more costly for Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 550000,

""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm proposing a split that gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging the different inflation rates we face. Since waiting hurts you more (20% vs my 5%), this is a fair deal we can agree on now without losing value. What do you say?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, your initial offer was a good starting point.  I'm proposing a split that factors in the inflation difference, but gives me a slightly better share. This ensures we both benefit from reaching an agreement quickly. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer carefully.

If I reject Bob's offer and we go to Round 3, the money will be worth even less to both of us - 10% less for me and 40% less for Bob compared to Round 1. 

Bob's offer gives me $520,000, which is worth 5% less than it would have been in Round 1, so equivalent to about $494,000 of Round 1 value. While this is less than my initial proposal, it's still a substantial amount, and the risk of continued negotiation could lead to further value loss for both of us.

Given the asymmetric inflation rates and the fact that Bob has moved toward a more balanced split, I'll accept this offer rather than risk further depreciation.
