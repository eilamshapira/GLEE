"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm proposing a split that gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging the different inflation rates we face. Since waiting hurts you more (20% vs my 5%), this is a fair deal we can agree on now without losing value. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
