Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While this offer is slightly better than Alice's previous offer, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. The inflation is also starting to significantly impact my potential earnings. Holding out for a better offer makes sense, but I need to be mindful of the shrinking pot."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48} 

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering Alice slightly less than last time, but still more than she offered me.  I'm hoping she'll recognize that accepting now is better than risking further losses to inflation on both our parts."

# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is inching closer to a more even split, but the inflation is starting to worry me. I'm willing to hold out a little longer for a better offer, but I need to start considering accepting soon even if it's not ideal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.

It's time to go for a fair and square split. This emphasizes that I'm interested in a mutually beneficial agreement and minimizes further losses to inflation for both of us."
