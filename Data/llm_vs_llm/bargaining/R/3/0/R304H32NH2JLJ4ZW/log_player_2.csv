"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether this 50-50 split is fair given the inflation effect that reduces the value by 5% each round.

If I reject and propose in round 2, the total value will be worth 5% less to me, meaning the $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $950,000 from my perspective. Even if I then got a better percentage split, I'd need to get significantly more than 50% to overcome this inflation penalty.

A 50-50 split giving me $500,000 now is better than risking getting a slightly higher percentage of a diminished pot in the next round.
