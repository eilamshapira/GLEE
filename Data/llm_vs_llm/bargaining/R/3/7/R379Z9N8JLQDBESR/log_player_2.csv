"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of the $10,000, while she takes $6,000.

If I reject this offer, I can make a counteroffer in the next round. However, due to inflation, the money will be worth 20% less to me in the next round, meaning the $10,000 would effectively be worth only $8,000 to me.

If I accept now, I get $4,000. If I reject and make a counteroffer, even if I asked for the entire $10,000 and Alice accepted (which is unlikely), it would only be worth $8,000 to me. Since $4,000 is 50% of $8,000, I would need to get more than 50% of the money in the next round to do better than accepting this offer.

Given the inflation penalty and the uncertainty of Alice accepting my counteroffer, I'll accept this offer.
