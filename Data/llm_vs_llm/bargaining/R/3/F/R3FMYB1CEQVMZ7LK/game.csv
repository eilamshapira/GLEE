5500.0,4500.0,"Let's split it reasonably! I'm offering $5500 for me, $4500 for you. This gives you a good deal upfront, and avoids the risk of inflation eating away at both our shares if we keep bargaining. Accept and we both win!",Alice,1,

5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, my money is now worth 20% less than before. I'm offering $5200 for me and $4800 for you. This is a better offer than last round considering inflation for me and a bit less for you, but we still both win if we take it. Let's not risk losing everything.",Alice,3,
