"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is a fairer reflection of our respective contributions.  Let's end this quickly and avoid the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000
