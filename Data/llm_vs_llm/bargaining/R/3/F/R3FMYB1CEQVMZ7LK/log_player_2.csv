"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it reasonably! I'm offering $5500 for me, $4500 for you. This gives you a good deal upfront, and avoids the risk of inflation eating away at both our shares if we keep bargaining. Accept and we both win! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my money is now worth 20% less than before. I'm offering $5200 for me and $4800 for you. This is a better offer than last round considering inflation for me and a bit less for you, but we still both win if we take it. Let's not risk losing everything. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
