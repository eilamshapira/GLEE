"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split the $100 as $60 for me and $40 for you. This way we both gain, and we can avoid the hassle of inflation in future rounds. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's split it 55/45. I think it's a fairer split given the potential for inflation and ensures we both walk away with a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 54, ""bob_gain"": 46, ""message"": ""Hey Bob, let's try $54 for me and $46 for you this time. It gives us both a fair share, considering inflation is impacting my gains more each round. Hope this works for you!""}"
