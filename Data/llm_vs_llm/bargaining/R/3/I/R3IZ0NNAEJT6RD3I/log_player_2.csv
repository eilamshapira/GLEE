"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the $100 as $60 for me and $40 for you. This way we both gain, and we can avoid the hassle of inflation in future rounds. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Alice, let's split it 55/45. I think it's a fairer split given the potential for inflation and ensures we both walk away with a decent amount.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, let's try $54 for me and $46 for you this time. It gives us both a fair share, considering inflation is impacting my gains more each round. Hope this works for you! 
# Bob gain: 46 
# Alice gain: 54
