"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to avoid any further delay (which would only hurt my share due to the discounting), I'm proposing that you take the full $100 right now. Let's settle immediately and move on! 
# Bob gain: 100 
# Alice gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me the entire $100
2. She's correct that delay hurts her more (10% per round) while it doesn't affect me (0%)
3. This is the maximum amount I could possibly get
4. There's no strategic advantage in rejecting this offer

This is actually the best possible outcome for me, and there's no way I could get more than $100 by continuing to negotiate. It's a rational first move from Alice given her time pressure.
