"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me propose a fair initial split while considering the 20% inflation penalty for each round if my offer is rejected.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split because:
1. It's close to a 50-50 split, which is generally seen as fair
2. I'm taking slightly more (55%) since Bob has the power to reject and make a counter-offer
3. If Bob rejects, my next possible gain will be worth 20% less, so I need to account for that risk"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Bob is offering me $4000, but due to 20% inflation, it's only worth $3200 to me
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, any amount I receive will be worth another 20% less
3. The risk of further negotiation and inflation could lead to even worse outcomes for me
4. Bob is clearly taking advantage of the inflation penalty that affects only me

Despite the unfavorable split, accepting now is better than risking further devaluation of my share.
