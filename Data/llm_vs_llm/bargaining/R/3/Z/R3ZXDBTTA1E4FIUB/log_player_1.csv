"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer to Bob, keeping in mind that time carries a cost for me due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing a fair split with a slight advantage for me. This gives Bob a substantial amount while allowing me to secure more than half, accounting for the inflation risk I face if we continue to further rounds. This is a good deal for both of us to settle now."
