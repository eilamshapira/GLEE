"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
* Alice is offering me $450,000 (45%) and keeping $550,000 (55%)
* If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
* However, due to 10% inflation, the money will be worth less next round
* $450,000 now is better than potentially getting more later but with 10% less value
* This is a reasonable first offer - not too far from 50/50
