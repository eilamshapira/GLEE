"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $400,000 while she gets $600,000 of the $1,000,000. 

If I reject, I'll make a counteroffer next round, but due to 10% inflation, the money will be worth less to me. Each round reduces the value by 10%, so waiting has a real cost for me.

Let me evaluate: $400,000 now is better than potentially getting more in future rounds after inflation reduces its value. If I reject and negotiations drag on, we both risk getting nothing after 12 rounds.
