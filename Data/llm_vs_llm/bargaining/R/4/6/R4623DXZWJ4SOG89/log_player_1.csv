Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a fair 50-50 split. This way we both benefit equally, and we can avoid losing value to inflation by concluding quickly. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
