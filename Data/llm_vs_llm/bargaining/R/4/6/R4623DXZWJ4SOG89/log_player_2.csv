"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take the bigger share, but I'm offering you something too. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is quite unfair, giving me only 10% of the total amount. While I need to consider the 5% inflation penalty per round, I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. This way we both benefit equally, and we can avoid losing value to inflation by concluding quickly.""}"
