"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make the first offer. I should acknowledge that as the game progresses, inflation reduces the value of money for me by 10% each round, so there's an incentive to reach an agreement sooner rather than later.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This gives both of us a substantial portion while acknowledging that I face inflation pressure in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
