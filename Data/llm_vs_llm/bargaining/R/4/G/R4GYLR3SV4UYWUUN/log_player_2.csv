"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal for Round 1: I'll take $5 and you get $95. If you reject and wait for Round 2, you'll be in controlâ€”but remember, every round that passes takes a 5% bite out of your share's real value. I believe it's in both our best interests to settle now before any discount applies further. 
# Bob gain: 95 
# Alice gain: 5 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
