"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly and avoid inflation losses 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice proposes a 50-50 split ($5000 each)
2. It's a fair offer that avoids any losses from inflation
3. Being the first round, I have many opportunities to counter if I reject
4. However, a 50-50 split is considered very fair in these situations
5. Since inflation doesn't affect me (0%), I'm not losing value by negotiating further
6. But there's always the risk of getting a worse deal or ending up with nothing if we can't agree in 12 rounds

Even though I could try to negotiate for more, a 50-50 split is fair and reasonable. Getting $5000 guaranteed now is better than risking it for potentially less later.
