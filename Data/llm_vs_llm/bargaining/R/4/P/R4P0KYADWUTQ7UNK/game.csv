6897.0,3103.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we settle right away with a division that reflects our differing time values: I get $6897 and you get $3103. Your money loses value faster (10% per round) than mine (5% per round), so by accepting now you secure $3103 at full strength rather than risking further discounting. I believe this is a fair split based on our future prospects. What do you say?",Alice,1,

5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I believe a fair split should be equal. Let's divide the money equally. This way, we both get $5000. Considering the inflation, this is a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I believe that waiting until the next round to make a proposal will work better for me given our differing inflation rates. I’d like to propose a different division in the next round. Let’s continue the discussion.",Alice,2,reject
4375.0,5625.0,"Hi Bob, as we enter round 3, the inflationary gap widens—my share is now worth 90% of its face value while yours is at 80%. To keep things fair and ensure you get no less than what your previous equal offer would have given you (in effective terms), I propose that I receive $4375 and you receive $5625. This way, your effective value remains approximately 0.8 × 5625 = $4500, matching the value of an equal split in round 2, while we both avoid further loss. I believe this is a balanced proposal given our respective discount rates. What do you say?",Alice,3,
