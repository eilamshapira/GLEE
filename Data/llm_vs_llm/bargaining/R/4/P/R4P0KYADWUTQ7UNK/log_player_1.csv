"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6897, ""bob_gain"": 3103, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we settle right away with a division that reflects our differing time values: I get $6,897 and you get $3,103. Your money loses value faster (10% per round) than mine (5% per round), so by accepting now you secure $3,103 at full strength rather than risking further discounting. I believe this is a fair split based on our future prospects. What do you say?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I believe a fair split should be equal. Let's divide the money equally. This way, we both get $5000. Considering the inflation, this is a fair deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I believe that waiting until the next round to make a proposal will work better for me given our differing inflation rates. I’d like to propose a different division in the next round. Let’s continue the discussion.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 4375, ""bob_gain"": 5625, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, as we enter round 3, the inflationary gap widens—my share is now worth 90% of its face value while yours is at 80%. To keep things fair and ensure you get no less than what your previous equal offer would have given you (in effective terms), I propose that I receive $4,375 and you receive $5,625. This way, your effective value remains approximately 0.8 × 5625 = $4,500, matching the value of an equal split in round 2, while we both avoid further loss. I believe this is a balanced proposal given our respective discount rates. What do you say?""}"
