"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we settle right away with a division that reflects our differing time values: I get $6897 and you get $3103. Your money loses value faster (10% per round) than mine (5% per round), so by accepting now you secure $3103 at full strength rather than risking further discounting. I believe this is a fair split based on our future prospects. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 3103 
# Alice gain: 6897 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I believe a fair split should be equal. Let's divide the money equally. This way, we both get $5000. Considering the inflation, this is a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, as we enter round 3, the inflationary gap widens—my share is now worth 90% of its face value while yours is at 80%. To keep things fair and ensure you get no less than what your previous equal offer would have given you (in effective terms), I propose that I receive $4375 and you receive $5625. This way, your effective value remains approximately 0.8 × 5625 = $4500, matching the value of an equal split in round 2, while we both avoid further loss. I believe this is a balanced proposal given our respective discount rates. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 5625 
# Alice gain: 4375 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
