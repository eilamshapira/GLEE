"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

Explanation: I'm offering Bob $40, leaving me with $60. I'm hoping this is a generous enough offer to be accepted right away, considering I'm going first and we both face inflation in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this offer.

*   **Bob's offer:** Alice gets $50, Bob gets $50.
*   **Inflation impact on Alice:** Alice's money is worth 5% less.
*   **Inflation impact on Bob:** Bob's money is worth 20% less.

If I reject this offer, I risk further inflation in the next round. Bob is also affected by inflation much more than I do. Therefore, I'll accept the offer.
