"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable and split the money 60/40. A fair deal for both of us to end this quickly.

# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 66.67, ""alice_gain"": 33.33, ""message"": ""Alice, considering the discounting from delay (5% for me and 10% for you each round), waiting only hurts your payoff. In round 3 you’d expect to get around $30 in value. I’m offering you $33.33 now (valued at 0.9×33.33 ≈ $30), which is as good as your continuation value. Let’s settle now and avoid further devaluation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right that waiting is costing us both. I'm proposing a 48/52 split. This recognizes the time value of money but still gives me a reasonable share. Let's close this out now. 
# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to close quickly. However, by rejecting your current offer, I can expect a better outcome in the next round. As it stands, your proposal gives me 52 (worth about $46.93 in round‑1 value), but my continuation value as the proposer in round 4 would be higher. Let's push to round 4 for an even closer deal.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 68.97, ""alice_gain"": 31.03, ""message"": ""Alice, if you reject my offer, you'll get to propose in round 5—but because further delay hurts you more (with your discount factor dropping to 0.6561), your best continuation payoff would be the equilibrium amount you could secure in round 5, which works out to an effective $22.61 in round‑1 terms. In round 4 terms that amounts to about $31.03. I'm offering you exactly that, so there's no benefit in waiting. Let's settle now and avoid additional losses from inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want to settle this now. I'm willing to be realistic, but 31 is just too low. Let's end this with a 37/63 split. It's a deal that reflects the time pressure but still gives us both something worthwhile. 
# Bob gain: 63 
# Alice gain: 37 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Alice, your offer gives me a nominal 63 in round 5, which—after the 18.55% reduction—is worth about $51.34 in round‑1 value. Based on the continuation value I’d expect by becoming the proposer in round 6 (even after further discounting), I’d secure an outcome that’s measurably better. Waiting a bit longer will allow me to claim a larger effective share, so I must reject your current proposal.""}"

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60.90, ""alice_gain"": 39.10, ""message"": ""Alice, if you reject today you'll earn the right to propose in round 7—but given the discounting, you'd secure roughly a round‐1 effective value of about $23.08. At the start of round 6, your money is worth 0.59049 of its nominal value, so $39.10 for you now gives an effective value of about $23.08 as well. There's no advantage in waiting further, so I believe this offer is fair given the time pressure. Let's settle now.""}"
