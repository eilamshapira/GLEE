"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly and avoid risk 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider this offer. Although we're splitting it evenly, I need to account for the inflation effect. If I reject and move to the next round, the money will be worth 10% less to me, so each dollar in round 2 is only worth $0.90 to me.

If I accept now, I get $50 at full value. If I reject and propose something better for me next round, Alice might reject, and we'd face more inflation in later rounds.

Given the inflation risk and the fact that 50-50 is a fair starting point, I'll accept this offer.
