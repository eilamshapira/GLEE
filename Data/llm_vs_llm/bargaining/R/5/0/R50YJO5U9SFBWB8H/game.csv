55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob! Since my inflation rate is much higher (20% vs your 5%), I'm proposing a slightly favorable split for me. This is actually fair because if we delay, the total value drops more for me than for you. Let's settle this quickly so we both get good value!",Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your inflation is higher, but your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor. Let's be reasonable - I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor to account for the difference in value loss.  We can avoid letting inflation eat away at our potential gains by settling this now.",Bob,2,

52.0,48.0,"Bob, let's find a compromise. I'm offering a 52/48 split which is more balanced than our previous offers. My inflation rate is 4 times higher than yours (20% vs 5%), which means delaying hurts me much more. We've already lost value due to two rounds of inflation. Let's agree and stop the loss for both of us.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
47.0,53.0,"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more balanced split.  However, the difference in our inflation rates is significant. I'm proposing 53/47. This split better reflects the value loss we're both facing with each passing round.  Let's close this out and avoid further losses.",Bob,4,
