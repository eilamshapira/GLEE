"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer that takes into account the different inflation rates for both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Hi Bob! Since my inflation rate is much higher (20% vs your 5%), I'm proposing a slightly favorable split for me. This is actually fair because if we delay, the total value drops more for me than for you. Let's settle this quickly so we both get good value!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your inflation is higher, but your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor. Let's be reasonable - I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor to account for the difference in value loss.  We can avoid letting inflation eat away at our potential gains by settling this now. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52,
""bob_gain"": 48,
""message"": ""Bob, let's find a compromise. I'm offering a 52/48 split which is more balanced than our previous offers. My inflation rate is 4 times higher than yours (20% vs 5%), which means delaying hurts me much more. We've already lost value due to two rounds of inflation. Let's agree and stop the loss for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more balanced split.  However, the difference in our inflation rates is significant. I'm proposing 53/47. This split better reflects the value loss we're both facing with each passing round.  Let's close this out and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 47 
# Bob gain: 53
