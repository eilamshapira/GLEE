"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Since my inflation rate is much higher (20% vs your 5%), I'm proposing a slightly favorable split for me. This is actually fair because if we delay, the total value drops more for me than for you. Let's settle this quickly so we both get good value! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your inflation is higher, but your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor. Let's be reasonable - I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor to account for the difference in value loss.  We can avoid letting inflation eat away at our potential gains by settling this now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's find a compromise. I'm offering a 52/48 split which is more balanced than our previous offers. My inflation rate is 4 times higher than yours (20% vs 5%), which means delaying hurts me much more. We've already lost value due to two rounds of inflation. Let's agree and stop the loss for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a fairer split, it still doesn't fully account for the significant difference in inflation we're experiencing.  Delaying is hurting her more than me."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 53, ""alice_gain"": 47, ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more balanced split.  However, the difference in our inflation rates is significant. I'm proposing 53/47. This split better reflects the value loss we're both facing with each passing round.  Let's close this out and avoid further losses.""}"
