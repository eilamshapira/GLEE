"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that I'm Alice and I need to consider the 20% depreciation per round for my share, I should make a strong initial offer. However, I also need to make it attractive enough for Bob to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this division because:
1. It's a 60-40 split which is favorable but not extremely greedy
2. If Bob rejects, my future gains will be worth less due to inflation
3. It's a reasonable first offer that leaves room for negotiation if needed"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer because even accounting for the 20% inflation on my share, I can still try to get a better deal. My $300,000 would only be worth $240,000 in this round due to inflation, which is too low considering the total sum. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round, aiming for a more balanced split while considering the continuing inflation effect."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since we're in round 3, my share will be worth 40% less than the original value. I need to adjust my offer accordingly while still making it attractive to Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering a more moderate 55-45 split because:
1. With 40% inflation on my share, my $550,000 would actually be worth $330,000 to me
2. This is a more balanced offer than my first one, showing willingness to compromise
3. If Bob rejects again, my future gains will be worth even less due to continued inflation
4. We need to reach an agreement soon to avoid losing value through more rounds"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer because:
1. With 48.8% inflation, my $250,000 would only be worth about $128,000 to me
2. This is still too unfavorable of a split, even considering the inflation pressure
3. While I need to be mindful of the increasing inflation, Bob's offer is too extreme
4. I still have enough rounds left to negotiate a better deal, even though time pressure is mounting

I'll make a more competitive counter-offer in the next round that better accounts for both our interests."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given we're in round 5 and my share will be worth 59% less than the original value, I need to make a more compelling offer that Bob is likely to accept, as the inflation is significantly impacting my potential gains.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split because:
1. With 59% inflation on my share, my $500,000 would actually be worth $205,000 to me
2. This is a completely fair split that should be hard for Bob to reject
3. It shows I'm willing to meet in the middle
4. We're approaching the halfway point of our rounds, and the inflation is severely impacting my potential gains
5. A balanced offer like this has a higher chance of being accepted, which is becoming increasingly important"
