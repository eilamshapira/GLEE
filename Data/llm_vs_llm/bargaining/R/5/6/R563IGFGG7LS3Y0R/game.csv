4500.0,5500.0,"Hi Bob, I propose that you get $5500 and I take $4500. Given that with each round my share loses 20% of its value, it makes sense for both of us to settle now. I hope we can agree quickly so that neither of us loses value.",Alice,1,

4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, your offer was tempting, but I think we can find a slightly more equitable split. I propose I take $6000 and you take $4000. This gives me a slight advantage, but remember the money is losing value with each round, so a quick agreement benefits us both.",Bob,2,

3990.0,6010.0,"Hi Bob, I understand the urgency to settle as delays diminish my shareâ€™s value by 20% each round. To move things forward quickly, I'm proposing that I receive $3990 and you get $6010. This gives you a bit more than your earlier proposal while helping both of us avoid further losses. I hope you agree to finalize this deal now.",Alice,3,
