"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that you get $5500 and I take $4500. Given that with each round my share loses 20% of its value, it makes sense for both of us to settle now. I hope we can agree quickly so that neither of us loses value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was tempting, but I think we can find a slightly more equitable split. I propose I take $6000 and you take $4000. This gives me a slight advantage, but remember the money is losing value with each round, so a quick agreement benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 3990, ""bob_gain"": 6010, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand the urgency to settle as delays diminish my shareâ€™s value by 20% each round. To move things forward quickly, I'm proposing that I receive $3990 and you get $6010. This gives you a bit more than your earlier proposal while helping both of us avoid further losses. I hope you agree to finalize this deal now.""}"
