"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob! How about a 60/40 split? I believe this is fair considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me. So my $400,000 would effectively become worth $320,000 if we wait.

While a 50/50 split might seem more ""fair"" in general, given that I face a 20% penalty per round while Alice doesn't, accepting 40% now is actually better than trying to negotiate for more and losing value due to inflation.

$400,000 now is better than potentially getting a larger percentage of a depreciated sum later.
