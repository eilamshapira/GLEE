"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair division. I believe this is a good starting point for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer gives me only 30% of the total amount, which is not fair enough. Since this is just the first round and the inflation impact is still minimal, I'll make a counter-proposal in the next round aiming for a more equitable distribution."

Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I propose a more balanced split that's closer to 50-50. This way, we both get a substantial amount, and we can avoid the inflation penalty by agreeing early.""}"
