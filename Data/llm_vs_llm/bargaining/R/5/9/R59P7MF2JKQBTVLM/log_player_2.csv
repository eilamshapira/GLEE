"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. Alice has offered a 50-50 split, which is generally considered fair. However, I need to consider that if I reject and move to the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me.

If I reject:
- Next round the $100 will only be worth $80 to me
- I could propose a higher split in my favor, but Alice might reject
- We'd risk further devaluation and potentially getting nothing

The current offer gives me $50, which is better than a potentially higher percentage of a depreciated amount in future rounds. Also, this fair split increases the likelihood of acceptance.
