600000.0,400000.0,Hi Bob! I'm offering a slightly favorable split to get this done quickly. Let's split it this way and get on with our day!,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
480000.0,520000.0,"Alice, let's finalize this quickly. Since my share loses 20% in value this round, I’m offering a nearly equal split with a slight edge for me to cover that loss. I believe this is fair for both of us—let's avoid further delays and settle the deal now!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Alright Bob, I'm adjusting my offer. I think this is a more reasonable split now, considering we're losing value with each round. Let's make this work!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, every extra round costs me significantly, and I'm sure you wouldn’t want to risk our overall gains either. I’m proposing a fair 50-50 split now—while I do lose some value due to inflation, delaying further will hurt us both. Let's settle this issue immediately and avoid the risk of ending up with much less later.",Bob,4,
