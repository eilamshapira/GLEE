Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's finalize this quickly. Since my share loses 20% in value this round, I’m offering a nearly equal split with a slight edge for me to cover that loss. I believe this is fair for both of us—let's avoid further delays and settle the deal now! 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every extra round costs me significantly, and I'm sure you wouldn’t want to risk our overall gains either. I’m proposing a fair 50-50 split now—while I do lose some value due to inflation, delaying further will hurt us both. Let's settle this issue immediately and avoid the risk of ending up with much less later.
