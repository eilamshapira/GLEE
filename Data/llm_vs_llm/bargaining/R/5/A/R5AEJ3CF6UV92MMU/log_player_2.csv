Since my share loses 20% in value this round, I’m offering a nearly equal split with a slight edge for me to cover that loss. I believe this is fair for both of us—let's avoid further delays and settle the deal now!""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Alright Bob, I'm adjusting my offer. I think this is a more reasonable split now, considering we're losing value with each round. Let's make this work! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, every extra round costs me significantly, and I'm sure you wouldn’t want to risk our overall gains either. I’m proposing a fair 50-50 split now—while I do lose some value due to inflation, delaying further will hurt us both. Let's settle this issue immediately and avoid the risk of ending up with much less later.""}"
