"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair initial offer, considering that I (Alice) have more to lose from delays due to higher inflation rate. I want to start with a reasonable proposal that Bob is likely to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

This offer gives me slightly more than half, acknowledging that I have more urgency to reach an agreement due to my higher inflation rate (20% vs Bob's 10%). It's fair enough that Bob should seriously consider accepting it rather than moving to the next round where both our potential gains would decrease."
