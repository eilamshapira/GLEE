"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is too unfair - 90% for Alice and only 10% for me is not a reasonable split. I'll make a counter-proposal in the next round, though I need to keep in mind that my share will be worth 20% less in purchasing power."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor to compensate for the 20% inflation penalty I'm facing. This seems fair as my $60 will effectively be worth $48 due to inflation, while Alice's $40 maintains its full value. I'm aiming for a reasonable split that Alice might accept while protecting my interests against the inflation penalty."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is still too unfavorable. With 36% inflation, my $20 would only be worth $12.80 in real value, while Alice gets $80 at full value. I'll make a more balanced counter-proposal in the next round, though I need to be mindful that the inflation penalty is increasing and we have a limited number of rounds to reach an agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35}

I'm increasing my requested share slightly to 65% because my portion is now worth significantly less due to inflation (my $65 is effectively worth only $41.60 due to the 36% inflation). This offer still leaves Alice with a substantial $35 at full value. I hope this revised offer will be more convincing while accounting for my inflation disadvantage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

With 59.04% inflation, my $30 would only be worth about $12.29 in real value, while Alice gets $70 at full value. This is still too unfavorable. However, I need to be careful as we're approaching the halfway point of our 12 rounds, and the inflation penalty is becoming severe. I'll make another counter-proposal, but we need to reach an agreement soon or we both risk getting nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 75, ""alice_gain"": 25}

I'm increasing my requested share to 75% because my portion is now severely impacted by inflation (my $75 would be worth only about $30.72 in real value due to the 59.04% inflation). Even with this higher split, Alice still gets $25 at full value, while my inflation-adjusted amount is not much higher. This offer attempts to balance the severe inflation penalty I'm facing while still giving Alice a meaningful share. We need to reach an agreement soon as the inflation penalty will only get worse in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While not ideal, with the 73.79% inflation, my $40 would be worth about $10.48 in real value. If I reject and continue negotiating, the inflation will become even more severe, and there's no guarantee Alice will offer better terms. With only 5 rounds left and the risk of getting nothing if we don't agree, it's better to accept this compromise now rather than risk further deterioration of value or complete failure to reach an agreement."
