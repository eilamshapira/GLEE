"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's make this quick. How about you take $5500 and I'll take $4500? We both leave with something nice!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since your money loses 10% value each round, this $4000 now is actually worth more to you than $4500 would be next round. Let's make this deal and both walk away happy. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
