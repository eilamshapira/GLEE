"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's make this quick. How about you take $5500 and I'll take $4500? We both leave with something nice! 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice has offered me $5500, which is more than half of the total amount. This is a decent offer, but I know that:
1. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
2. Alice's money loses 10% value each round, while mine doesn't
3. We have 11 more rounds if needed

Given that Alice's money will be worth less in the next round (only 90% of its current value), I could potentially negotiate for a better deal. However, there's also the risk of prolonged negotiation leading to both of us getting nothing if we can't agree within 12 rounds.

Still, since I have a slight advantage with the inflation factor, I'll try to negotiate for a better deal.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice's money loses 10% value each round, her initial $4500 would only be worth $4050 to her this round. I'll use this to propose a slightly better deal for myself while still being reasonable.
