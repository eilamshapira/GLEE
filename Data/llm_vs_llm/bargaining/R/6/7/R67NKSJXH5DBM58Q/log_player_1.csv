"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we secure our benefits now by dividing the $10,000 fairly given the pressure of inflation. You’d receive $5,500 and I’d take $4,500. This split reflects our mutual interest in closing the deal promptly and avoiding further devaluation. Let me know your thoughts!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but I believe a 60/40 split is more reasonable. Let's secure a deal that benefits us both fairly. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
