"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we secure our benefits now by dividing the $10000 fairly given the pressure of inflation. You’d receive $5500 and I’d take $4500. This split reflects our mutual interest in closing the deal promptly and avoiding further devaluation. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500
