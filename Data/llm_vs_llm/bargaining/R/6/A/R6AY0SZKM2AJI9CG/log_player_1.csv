"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer that recognizes both our interests while accounting for the inflation effect on Bob's side.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering you $450,000, Bob, which is a substantial portion. Since you face 10% inflation per round while I face 0%, accepting now gives you more purchasing power than waiting for later rounds. This is a fair split that benefits us both."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000}

Bob, I'm offering you $400,000. Since you're facing 10% inflation each round, this $400,000 now is worth more to you than potentially more money in future rounds. If we go to round 4, your share would lose another 10% in value. This is a reasonable compromise that acknowledges the time pressure you face due to inflation."
