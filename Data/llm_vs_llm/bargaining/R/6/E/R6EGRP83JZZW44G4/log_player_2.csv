"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it equally and end this fairly, Bob. No need to let inflation eat into our gains. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
- She's proposing a 50-50 split ($5000 each)
- It's a fair offer right from the start
- If I reject, the total amount will be worth 10% less in the next round
- Getting $5000 now is better than potentially getting slightly more later due to inflation
