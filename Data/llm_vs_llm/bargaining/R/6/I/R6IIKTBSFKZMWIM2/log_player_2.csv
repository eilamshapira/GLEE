"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. It's a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
2. However, if I reject, I can make my own offer in the next round
3. The money will be worth 5% less (9,500$ total value for me) if we go to the next round
4. There's no guarantee Alice will accept a better offer from me
5. 5,000$ now is better than risking getting less in future rounds
