"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share for both 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice's offer provides me with $40, which is less than a 50-50 split, I need to consider the inflation effect. If I reject this offer, in the next round, the money will be worth 5% less to me. This means that even if I propose a more favorable split in the next round, the total value would be reduced.

Let me analyze this: If I reject and propose a 50-50 split next round, I'd get $50, but with 5% inflation, that's effectively worth $47.50 to me. This is still better than the current $40 offer, assuming Alice accepts my counter-proposal.

Given that I don't know how inflation affects Alice, and I can make a better offer in the next round that would still benefit me more than accepting $40 now, I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split while acknowledging the inflation factor.

{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""I think a more balanced division would be fair. While I understand you wanted more in your initial offer, this split is closer to equal and beneficial for both of us. Keep in mind that further delays will reduce the value for me due to inflation, which isn't ideal for either of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation's impact on you, this is a reasonable compromise 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate this new offer. Alice is offering me $43, which is an improvement from her initial $40 offer. However, inflation has now reduced the value of my money by 9.75% compared to round 1.

The real value of Alice's current offer to me is: $43 Ã— (1 - 0.0975) = $38.81

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 4, the inflation will increase further, reducing the value of any amount I receive even more. If I propose another split, there's no guarantee Alice will accept, and we could continue this back-and-forth while my potential gain loses more value.

Alice has acknowledged the inflation's impact on me in her message, and has slightly improved her offer. While not ideal, this may be the most practical outcome given the inflation penalty I face.
