Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"":900000,""bob_gain"":100000,""message"":""I propose a generous offer where I take $900,000 and you receive $100,000. Let's agree on this to avoid the impact of inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose an equal 50-50 split. This is fair for both of us, and we should agree now because inflation will hurt both our potential gains if we continue negotiating. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
