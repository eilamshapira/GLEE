"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a generous offer where I take $900000 and you receive $100000. Let's agree on this to avoid the impact of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice's offer gives me only 10% of the total amount ($100,000), which is quite low. Even with 20% inflation per round, I can make a counter-offer in the next round where we'd both be better off. The total amount in the next round would still be worth $800,000 to me, allowing me to propose a more equitable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while acknowledging the time pressure we both face.

{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""I propose an equal 50-50 split. This is fair for both of us, and we should agree now because inflation will hurt both our potential gains if we continue negotiating.""
