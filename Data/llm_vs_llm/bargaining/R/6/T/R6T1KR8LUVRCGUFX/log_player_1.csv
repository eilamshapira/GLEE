"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a strategic first offer, considering that Bob faces a 5% depreciation per round while I don't face any depreciation.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. This is a reasonable first offer that gives Bob a significant portion while still being advantageous for me. If Bob rejects this, the money will be worth less to him in the next round due to the 5% depreciation, while maintaining its full value for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
* For me (Alice), I would get $55 at full value
* For Bob, he would get $45, but it's worth 5% less to him (effectively $42.75 in round 1 value)
* If I reject, we go to round 3 where I can make a new offer, but Bob's money will be worth even less (10% less than round 1)
* This gives me more leverage in the next round, as Bob's depreciation increases

However, $55 is still a decent offer, and there's always the risk of prolonged negotiation leading to a worse outcome. While I could potentially get more by rejecting, this is a reasonable compromise.
