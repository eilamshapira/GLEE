"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's split the money equally to avoid further losses due to inflation. This way, we both get a fair share of $5000 each. Accepting this offer now will prevent the money from losing more value in the next rounds. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I agree that a fair split now prevents further losses from inflation. I accept your offer of $5000 each. Let's finalize the deal.""}"
