"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a split that takes into account that Bob's money loses 20% value each round. Since I know Bob is rational and understands this, I'll offer a fair but strategic split.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This is a reasonable 60-40 split. My reasoning to share with Bob: ""I'm offering you $4,000 now, which is better than getting a larger nominal amount in the next round when your money will be worth 20% less. For example, even if you counter with a $6,000 offer to you next round, it would only be worth $4,800 in today's value to you."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. For me (Alice), I would get $4,500 at full value
2. For Bob, they would get $5,500, but at 20% less value due to inflation
   * Bob's real value = $5,500 * 0.8 = $4,400

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round:
- Bob's money would be worth 40% less in that round
- I could potentially get a better deal, but there's risk of further rounds

Since Bob's current offer gives them effectively less than their initial share ($4,400 vs my $4,500), and prolonging the game makes their position increasingly worse, I'll accept this offer.
