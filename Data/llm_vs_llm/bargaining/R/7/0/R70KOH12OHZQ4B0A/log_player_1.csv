"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll propose a fair split, considering that any delay will hurt me more than Bob due to the 10% inflation penalty per round.

""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I'm offering you a fair $4,500 while I take $5,500. Since inflation will reduce my share by 10% each round, it's in both our interests to agree now rather than drag this out.""
