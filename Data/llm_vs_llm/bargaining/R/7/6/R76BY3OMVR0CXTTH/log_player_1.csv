"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I'll make a proposal that considers the decreasing value of the money for both of us.

Here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

My reasoning: I'm offering Bob a significant portion, hoping he'll accept it to avoid the risk of further devaluation. I'm also securing a decent amount for myself in the early round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 595000 
# Bob gain: 405000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Let's calculate the actual worth of the offer, considering the devaluation:

*   **Alice's gain:** 595000 * (1 - 0.05) = 565250
*   **Bob's gain:** 405000 * (1 - 0.10) = 364500

This offer is better than what I proposed last round, adjusted for the inflation. I'll accept it.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
