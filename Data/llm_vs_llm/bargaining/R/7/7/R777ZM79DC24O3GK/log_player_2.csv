"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair is fair! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer of an even split of $50 each.

While this is a fair proposal, I should consider the game dynamics. If I reject, I get to make a counter-offer next round, but the total value decreases by 10% to $90. If I offer Alice $40 and keep $50 in the next round, she might accept since she'd still get almost as much as now.

However, this strategy could backfire if Alice rejects my counter-offer, leading to further devaluation and potentially worse outcomes for both of us. The even split is fair and guarantees me a solid amount without risk.
