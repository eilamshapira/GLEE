"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair split. Let's get this over with. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $4000 out of $10000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, the total amount will decrease by 10% (to $9000)
4. Alice's justification isn't very compelling - a 60-40 split in her favor isn't particularly ""fair""

Given that I can make a counter-offer next round and still have a good amount to work with ($9000), I'll reject this uneven split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer, but still giving myself a slight advantage since Alice tried to take a larger share initially:

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I propose a more balanced split that's closer to 50-50. This way we both get a good portion and don't risk losing more money to inflation.""}"
