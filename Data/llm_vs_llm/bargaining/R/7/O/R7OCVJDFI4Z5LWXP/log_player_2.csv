"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for herself
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 10% less in the next round
3. I could counter-offer in the next round, but $400,000 now is better than $450,000 in the next round (due to 10% inflation)
4. We have limited rounds, and negotiations could lead to both of us getting nothing
5. This is a reasonable first offer - I get 40% which is significant
