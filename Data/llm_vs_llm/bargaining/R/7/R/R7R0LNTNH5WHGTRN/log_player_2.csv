"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice offered me 4000$ (40%) while keeping 6000$ (60%) for herself. 

Given that:
1. Money doesn't lose value for me in future rounds
2. Money loses 10% value for Alice each round
3. I can make a counter-offer next round if I reject

If I reject, Alice's 6000$ will be worth only 5400$ to her next round. This gives me negotiating leverage, as she might be more willing to accept a better deal for me rather than risk further devaluation.

I believe I can get a better deal by rejecting this offer and making my own proposal next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice's money loses 10% value each round, I'll propose a more favorable split for me while highlighting this time pressure.

{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Given that your money loses 10% value each round, this 4000$ now is worth more than 6000$ next round. Let's conclude this efficiently.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer, slightly better split for you 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice has increased my share by 200$ from her first offer (from 4000$ to 4200$)
2. Her 5800$ is already worth only 4698$ to her (due to 19% devaluation)
3. If I reject, in the next round:
   - I can still get full value
   - Her money will be worth 29% less
   - Her 5800$ would be worth even less to her

The increase she offered is minimal, and given the strong inflation effect on her side, I can likely get a better deal by rejecting and making another offer next round when she'll be under more pressure.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that Alice's money has already lost significant value and will continue to depreciate, I'll propose a split that's more favorable to me but still gives her a significant amount that she might accept rather than risk further devaluation.

{""bob_gain"": 6500,
""alice_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""At this point, due to 29% inflation on your side, this 3500$ is worth about 2485$ to you. If you reject, next round's money will be worth even less. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances.""}"
