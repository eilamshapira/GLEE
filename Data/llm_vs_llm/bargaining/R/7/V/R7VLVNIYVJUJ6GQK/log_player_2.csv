"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40 in my favor. It's a fair start considering the inflation risk. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
1. She's offering me $40, keeping $60 for herself
2. While there's inflation risk in future rounds, it doesn't affect me (0% inflation for my side)
3. I have the power to make a counter-offer next round
4. Since inflation doesn't affect me, I can safely negotiate for a better deal

Given that I'm not affected by inflation and have 11 more rounds to negotiate, I can try to get a better split. I'll reject this offer and propose a more favorable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since inflation doesn't affect me, I'll propose a more balanced split in my favor, but with a reasonable message to encourage acceptance.

{""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering we both need to reach an agreement, and I'm willing to negotiate.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to take a bit less to reach an agreement quickly. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:
1. Alice has moved from wanting 60 to accepting 55, showing willingness to compromise
2. I'm being offered $45, up from the initial $40
3. Alice is facing significant inflation (36% less value for her)
4. I'm not affected by inflation
5. We still have 9 rounds left

Given that Alice is facing significant inflation pressure (her $55 is worth much less now) while I'm not affected, I can still negotiate for a better deal. The inflation pressure on her side gives me an advantage in future rounds.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Given that Alice is facing significant inflation pressure and has shown willingness to compromise, I'll propose a split that's more in my favor but not too aggressive, as we still need to reach an agreement.

{""bob_gain"": 65,
""alice_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Given the current inflation impact, I propose this split. You'll want to secure your value sooner rather than later, and this is still a significant amount for you.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage, and we can both walk away with a fair share. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this new situation:
1. Alice is now offering a 50-50 split, which normally would be considered very fair
2. However, Alice is facing severe inflation (59.04% less value for her)
3. I'm still not affected by inflation at all
4. We have 7 rounds remaining
5. Due to the increasing inflation pressure on Alice's side, her negotiating position is weakening

While the 50-50 split seems fair on the surface, the severe inflation affecting Alice puts me in a stronger negotiating position. Her $50 is worth much less to her now, while my potential gains maintain their value. I can likely get a better deal by continuing negotiations.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Given the significant inflation pressure on Alice's side (nearly 60% devaluation) and my unchanged position, I'll push for a more favorable split while maintaining a rational explanation.

{""bob_gain"": 70,
""alice_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""With the current inflation rate affecting your gains by almost 60%, we should reach an agreement soon. This offer gives you $30 now, which is worth more than a larger amount in future rounds. Let's conclude this negotiation.""}"
