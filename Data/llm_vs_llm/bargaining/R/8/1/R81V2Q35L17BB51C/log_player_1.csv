"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my first offer in this negotiation game.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm proposing a slight advantage for myself since I'm going first, but still offering Bob a substantial amount. This is a fair starting point given the different inflation rates we face - mine is higher at 10% compared to Bob's 5%, so I need to account for that disadvantage if we go to multiple rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this 50-50 split since inflation affects me more heavily (10%) than it affects Bob (5%), making this less favorable for me than it appears. Moving to round 3 where I can make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my new offer, taking into account the inflation rates we're both experiencing.

{""alice_gain"": 5400, ""bob_gain"": 4600}

I'm adjusting my proposal slightly to be more appealing to Bob while still accounting for my higher inflation rate. Since my money loses value faster (10% per round versus Bob's 5%), a fair split needs to consider this difference in our situations. This offer gives Bob a bit more than my initial proposal while still protecting my interests given the asymmetric inflation rates."
