600000.0,400000.0,Let's split this fairly. I think this is a good start.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
1.0,999999.0,"Alice, time is not on your side. If you reject now, you'll be the proposer in the next round—but remember that your money loses 20% of its value with each delay, and I remain unaffected. I’m offering you a token share now, which is better than nothing later. Accept and let’s end this quickly.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
200000.0,800000.0,"Alright Bob, let's try a different approach. I'm offering you a significantly larger share this time. Take it or leave it, the clock is ticking, and my share is shrinking.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
1.0,999999.0,"Alice, by rejecting my offer you’d become the proposer in round 5—but your money will be worth only about 41% of its original value then, and you’ll be forced to give me almost the entire amount to get any acceptance from me. In this round, your share is still discounted by nearly 49%, so a token amount now is infinitely better than ending up with nothing later. I urge you to accept this offer and avoid further erosion of your wealth.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
100000.0,900000.0,"Bob, this is the last offer. Take the deal before I get nothing. Consider this your last chance to get a decent share. Don't be greedy!",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
1.0,999999.0,"Alice, in round 6 your money is now worth only 32.768% of its original value. If you reject, you'll be forced into the next round as proposer, but you'll be in an even weaker position—I'll be able to claim virtually the entire pie then. This token offer is far better than the near‐zero outcome you'd face later. Accept this division and secure your minimal share before it erodes any further.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
1000.0,999000.0,"Bob, this is the absolute final offer. If you reject this, I will give you nothing, and you will also receive nothing. Consider what you'll get if you keep playing and make your choice wisely.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,accept
