Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, time is not on your side. If you reject now, you'll be the proposer in the next round—but remember that your money loses 20% of its value with each delay, and I remain unaffected. I’m offering you a token share now, which is better than nothing later. Accept and let’s end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, by rejecting my offer you’d become the proposer in round 5—but your money will be worth only about 41% of its original value then, and you’ll be forced to give me almost the entire amount to get any acceptance from me. In this round, your share is still discounted by nearly 49%, so a token amount now is infinitely better than ending up with nothing later. I urge you to accept this offer and avoid further erosion of your wealth. 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, in round 6 your money is now worth only 32.768% of its original value. If you reject, you'll be forced into the next round as proposer, but you'll be in an even weaker position—I'll be able to claim virtually the entire pie then. This token offer is far better than the near‐zero outcome you'd face later. Accept this division and secure your minimal share before it erodes any further.
