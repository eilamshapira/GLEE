Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's make a fair split considering the inflation rates. I'm offering you 450k, which is quite reasonable given that your inflation rate is much lower than mine.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the inflation disparity, but your initial offer heavily favors you.  Let's be more realistic. This offer accounts for the time pressure we both face. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The offer is too low, especially considering my higher inflation rate. I can propose a better split in the next round that better accounts for our different inflation pressures."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a perfectly equal split. Given that my inflation rate is 20% and yours is only 5%, we should reach an agreement soon. This is a fair compromise from my previous offer.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time. I'm offering a 60/40 split. This factors in the inflation differences while still giving us both a significant sum. Let's be practical and close this deal. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because:
1. The inflation is significantly impacting my potential gains (48.8% less already)
2. Further delays will reduce my value even more dramatically than Bob's
3. The 400k/600k split, while not ideal, is reasonable given our different inflation rates
4. We need to reach an agreement before both of us end up with nothing"
