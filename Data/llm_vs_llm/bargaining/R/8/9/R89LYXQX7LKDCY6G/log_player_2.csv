"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a fair split considering the inflation rates. I'm offering you 450k, which is quite reasonable given that your inflation rate is much lower than mine. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""I understand the inflation disparity, but your initial offer heavily favors you.  Let's be more realistic. This offer accounts for the time pressure we both face.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm proposing a perfectly equal split. Given that my inflation rate is 20% and yours is only 5%, we should reach an agreement soon. This is a fair compromise from my previous offer. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Alice is right that we need to reach an agreement soon, an even split still significantly disadvantages me in the long run.  I need to push for a better share before the inflation eats into my potential gains too much."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. I'm offering a 60/40 split. This factors in the inflation differences while still giving us both a significant sum. Let's be practical and close this deal.""}"
