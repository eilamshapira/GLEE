55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 55/45 split in our favor. This is fair because I face a 5% inflation penalty each round, so if we drag this on, we both lose value. Let's finish this efficiently with a reasonable division.",Alice,1,

40.0,60.0,"Alice, I understand your inflation concerns, but mine are even higher at 20% per round. To be fair and account for this significant inflation affecting me, I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This ensures I get a reasonable value for my share considering the rapidly decreasing worth of the money for me. Let's accept this and avoid further losses for both of us.",Bob,2,

50.0,50.0,"Bob, now I understand you face 20% inflation while I face 5%. Let's be completely fair with a 50/50 split. This acknowledges both our inflation challenges while being equitable. If we continue to the next round, we both lose more value - you especially with your higher inflation rate. This is a fair compromise that respects both our positions.",Alice,3,
