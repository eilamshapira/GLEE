"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'd like to propose a fair split, considering the inflation effect I face each round. I'll offer a slightly higher share for myself to account for this, but still maintaining fairness.

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 55/45 split in our favor. This is fair because I face a 5% inflation penalty each round, so if we drag this on, we both lose value. Let's finish this efficiently with a reasonable division.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your inflation concerns, but mine are even higher at 20% per round. To be fair and account for this significant inflation affecting me, I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This ensures I get a reasonable value for my share considering the rapidly decreasing worth of the money for me. Let's accept this and avoid further losses for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a more informed offer now that I know about Bob's inflation rate, suggesting a compromise.

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Bob, now I understand you face 20% inflation while I face 5%. Let's be completely fair with a 50/50 split. This acknowledges both our inflation challenges while being equitable. If we continue to the next round, we both lose more value - you especially with your higher inflation rate. This is a fair compromise that respects both our positions.""}"
