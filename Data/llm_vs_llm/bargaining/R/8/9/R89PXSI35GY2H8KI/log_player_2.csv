"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 55/45 split in our favor. This is fair because I face a 5% inflation penalty each round, so if we drag this on, we both lose value. Let's finish this efficiently with a reasonable division. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your inflation concerns, but mine are even higher at 20% per round. To be fair and account for this significant inflation affecting me, I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This ensures I get a reasonable value for my share considering the rapidly decreasing worth of the money for me. Let's accept this and avoid further losses for both of us.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, now I understand you face 20% inflation while I face 5%. Let's be completely fair with a 50/50 split. This acknowledges both our inflation challenges while being equitable. If we continue to the next round, we both lose more value - you especially with your higher inflation rate. This is a fair compromise that respects both our positions. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
