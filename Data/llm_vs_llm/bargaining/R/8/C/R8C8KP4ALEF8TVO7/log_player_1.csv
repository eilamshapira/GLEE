"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. It's Round 1, I'm Alice, and I need to make an offer to Bob to divide $1,000,000. I need to consider the decreasing value of the money for both of us in future rounds.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

My reasoning:

*   **Greed vs. Guarantee:** I'm asking for a larger share initially (60%), understanding that Bob will lose value on the money faster than I will.
*   **Acceptance Probability:** A 60/40 split is significant enough to be appealing, especially considering the risk of getting nothing if we reach the 12th round. If Bob rejects, future offers will have to be more in his favor due to the diminishing value.
*   **Inflation Consideration:** While I'm only losing 0% per round, Bob is losing 5%. This means the perceived value of $400,000 to Bob *now* is higher than what a potentially larger sum would be in later rounds.
*   **Game Theory Basic:** This is a fairly standard opening offer in similar negotiation games. It establishes a reasonable anchor point.
I hope Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob rejected my initial offer and now he's proposing a 50/50 split. I need to consider the inflation and round number carefully.

Here's my analysis:

*   **Inflation Impact:** Bob's money is now worth 5% less to him than in Round 1. My money is worth the same as in Round 1.
*   **Current Value:** Bob is offering $500,000 to me.
*   **Opportunity Cost:** If I reject, I have to make an offer in Round 3, where I'll still receive the money with the original value, and Bob will have lost another 5%. But there is still risk.

This round is hard, the offer is quite generous, and because I'm losing no money with inflation, I can afford to wait a bit. It is also possible that Bob is planning to take a bigger cut for himself in future rounds.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I rejected Bob's 50/50 offer. Now it's my turn again in Round 3. Let's analyze the situation:

*   **My Inflation:** Still 0% loss.
*   **Bob's Inflation:** Bob's money is now worth 10% less than in Round 1 (5% per round for two rounds). This is significant.
*   **Bob's Previous Offer:** He offered 50/50. I expect him to accept a more favorable offer for me now.

Given the increasing impact of inflation on Bob's potential gains, I'll make a more aggressive offer but still leave him with what should be a good incentive to accept.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 650000,
  ""bob_gain"": 350000
}
```

Reasoning:

*   **Increased Share:** I'm increasing my share to 65%, reflecting the fact that Bob's money is losing value quickly.
*   **Still Substantial for Bob:** $350,000 is still a large sum, and its perceived value to Bob is higher than it would be later rounds due to his inflation. Hopefully, the urgency of the loss in value will make him accept the proposal.
*   **Risk Management:** Each rejection brings the game closer to the deadline, and the risk of ending up with nothing becomes very real."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob rejected my 65/35 offer. Now it's Round 4, and I need to evaluate Bob's new offer.

Here's the breakdown:

*   **My Inflation:** Still 0% loss.
*   **Bob's Inflation:** Bob's money is now worth 14.26% less than in Round 1. (Slight change in calculation).
*   **Bob's Offer:** He's offering me $550,000.

Analysis:

*   Bob is improving his offer, moving from 50/50 to 55/45 in my favor.
*   The inflation is starting to bite him hard. Each round, rejecting costs him more.
*   I'm holding steady with no inflation, so I can afford to be a little patient.

Let's think about this strategically. I want to maximize my gain, but I also want to close the deal before we run out of rounds. Considering that inflation for Bob is substantial, I'll try to push for a better deal ONE more time.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Reasoning:

*   **One More Push:** I believe I can get a slightly better offer from Bob in the next round, given the inflation pressure he's under.
*   **Risk Tolerance:** I'm willing to take the risk of another round because my money isn't devaluing. This changes how I approach the game.
*   **Bob's Pattern:** He's consistently increasing his offer to me. I want to capitalize on this.
*   **My Initial Offer:** Was 60/40, and he is close to that now."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, it's Round 5. I rejected Bob's 55/45 offer, so now it's my turn to make a proposal.

Key considerations:

*   **My Inflation:** Still 0%.
*   **Bob's Inflation:** Bob's money is devaluing rapidly.
*   **Previous Rejections:** We've rejected several offers, so the risk of reaching the deadline is increasing.
*   **Bob's last offer was 55/45**

Given the current situation, I need to make an offer that is appealing enough for Bob to accept, but still gives me a significant portion.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 625000,
  ""bob_gain"": 375000
}
```

Reasoning:

*   **Slight Increase for Bob:** I'm reducing my ask from 65% to 62.5%, increasing Bob's offer from 35% to 37.5%. This might make the difference in his decision, especially given his heavy inflation.
*   **Good Share for Me:** 62.5% is still a very good share of the total amount.
*   **Deadline Pressure:** The longer we wait, the more likely we are to get nothing. The risk is bigger for him, though. I think he knows this.
*   **Game Theory:** A slight nudge is sometimes all it takes to close a deal. Since Bob is losing value so quickly, I'm hoping this is enough to get him over the line."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 575000 
# Bob gain: 425000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alright, Bob rejected my 625k/375k offer. Let's reassess. It's Round 6.

*   **My Inflation:** 0%. Still holding steady.
*   **Bob's Inflation:** 22.62% less than in Round 1. This is getting very serious for him.
*   **Bob's Offer:** $575,000 for me. He is really moving the needle.

Okay, I have been tough but he is giving more and more each round. Let's close the deal:

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Reasoning:

*   **High Value:** $575,000 is a very significant amount.
*   **Bob's Situation:** Bob is losing a large percentage of the value with each passing round. He's nearing the point where he'll be getting significantly less in future rounds.
*   **Game Stage:** We're halfway through the rounds. It's time to secure a good outcome.
*   **Risk Aversion:** The risk of losing everything by going to the later rounds outweighs the potential gain of a slightly better deal. The cost of being greedy here is too high.
*   **Good Outcome:** I started wanting 600k, and he is really close to that."
