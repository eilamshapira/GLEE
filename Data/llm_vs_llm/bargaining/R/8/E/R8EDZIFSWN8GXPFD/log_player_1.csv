"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to make a fair offer considering the 10% inflation penalty I face each round. If we go to multiple rounds, the total amount will be worth less to me, so I should aim for a reasonable split that Bob would accept.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose we split the money evenly, with each of us getting $5,000. This is a fair division that respects both of our interests."
