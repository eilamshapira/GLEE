Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I’m proposing an equal split — $500,000 for you and $500,000 for me. By agreeing now, we both avoid the 5% per round inflation penalty (I’m sure you appreciate that delaying the deal only makes things worse for at least one of us). Let’s settle quickly and both walk away with a fair share. What do you say?""}"
