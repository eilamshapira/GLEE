"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m proposing an equal split — $500000 for you and $500000 for me. By agreeing now, we both avoid the 5% per round inflation penalty (I’m sure you appreciate that delaying the deal only makes things worse for at least one of us). Let’s settle quickly and both walk away with a fair share. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
