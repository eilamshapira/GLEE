"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose to split the money with a 60-40 ratio in my favor. This way, we both get a significant amount, and we can avoid the loss due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
- She proposes I get $4000 while she gets $6000
- If I reject, we move to the next round where I can make an offer
- However, the total amount will decrease by 20% to $8000
- My maximum potential gain in the next round would be less than $8000
- The $4000 offer now is still quite substantial

While the split isn't entirely equal, accepting now guarantees me $4000 without risking further depreciation. Making a counter-offer might lead to additional rounds and significant value loss.
