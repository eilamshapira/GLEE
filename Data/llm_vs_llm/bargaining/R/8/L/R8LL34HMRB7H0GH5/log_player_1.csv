Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 689655, ""bob_gain"": 310345, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I'll take $689,655 and you'll get $310,345. This split accounts for the depreciation costs youâ€™d face if we delay the agreement. Accept this offer now and we both secure maximum value before inflation takes its toll!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, let's adjust the split considering the depreciation rates. I'm proposing $450000 for me and $550000 for you. This way, we both maintain better value as the game progresses. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
