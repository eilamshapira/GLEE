"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

The offer gives me $40 out of $100, which is 40% of the total. While this isn't exactly an even split, it's a reasonable offer considering:

1. By rejecting, I risk getting a worse deal in future rounds
2. The money maintains its value for me (0% inflation)
3. I get an immediate guaranteed payoff
4. $40 is a significant portion of the total

While I could try to negotiate for more by rejecting, I think this is a fair enough offer to accept.
