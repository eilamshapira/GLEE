Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, the actual value I get from Bob's offer is 450000 * 0.95 = 427500.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is not favorable to me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less with each passing round, and it's now the third round, the actual value I get will be reduced by 10% (5% in round 2 + 5% in round 3).

To make up for this loss, I'll make a slightly more favorable offer to myself.
