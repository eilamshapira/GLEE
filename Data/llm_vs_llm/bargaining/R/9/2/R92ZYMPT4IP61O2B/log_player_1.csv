"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I'm playing as Alice, and I need to make an offer that Bob is likely to accept, considering the dwindling value of the money for me over time. Here's my first offer:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **First Round Advantage:** Since it's the first round, the money is worth the most to me. I'm offering a split that favors me but hopefully isn't so outrageous that Bob will reject it outright.
*   **Bob's Incentive:** $4000 is a substantial amount of money. Bob has no reason to think the value will decrease for him, so this might be enticing enough to accept now.
*   **Strategic Positioning:** I'm leaving room for negotiation. If Bob rejects this, I can offer more in subsequent rounds, knowing the stakes are higher for me each time. I'm trying to gauge Bob's risk aversion and how much he values getting a quick payout."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 10000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is an absolutely terrible offer from Bob! He's trying to take all the money. Even with the 20% reduction, getting nothing is worse.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's my turn again. The money is now worth 20% less than in round 1 for me, so I need to consider that in my offer. Bob's last offer was insulting, so I need to make something compelling, but still advantageous for me given the circumstances.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 7000,
""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **Inflation Consideration:** While I still want to maximize my gain, I recognize that the money is losing value for me. Getting 7000 * 0.8 = 5600 in round 1 dollars is better than risking getting nothing later.
*   **Increased Incentive for Bob:** I'm decreasing my share from my initial offer, hoping to tempt Bob to accept. $3000 is still a significant sum and avoids the risk of getting even less if we keep negotiating.
*   **Psychological Play:** By slightly increasing Bob's share, I'm signaling a willingness to compromise, which might make him more receptive.

I'm walking a tightrope here, balancing my desire for a good payout with the increasing risk of further inflation and ending up with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200 
# Bob gain: 9800 
Do you accept this offer?","This is still a ridiculously unfair offer from Bob. With the inflation, I'd be getting next to nothing.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Alright, this is getting serious. My money is now worth almost half of what it was in round 1. I need to make an offer that is both appealing to Bob and worthwhile for me, given the devaluation.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 7500,
""bob_gain"": 2500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **Inflation Adjustment:** I'm acutely aware that my payout will be significantly less valuable due to the 48.8% reduction. 7500 * (1 - 0.488) = 3840 in Round 1 dollars.
*   **Bob's Perspective:** I'm offering Bob $2500, which is still a considerable amount with no devaluation for him. I am betting that this offer will be more appealing.
*   **Desperation Mode:** I'm moving closer to a point where any future gains might not be worth the risk. I am trying to get a substantial payout.
*   **The threat of nothing:** My intention is for this to be close to my final offer. We are wasting rounds and nearing the deadline. If Bob refuses, then we might not get any money.

I'm still trying to maximize my gain, but I'm also increasingly concerned about securing *something* rather than risking everything. This offer reflects that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 9999 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is clearly trying to be unreasonable. Absolutely not.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","This is ridiculous. Bob is playing a zero-sum game and I'm rapidly losing money due to inflation. I need to make an offer that is tempting enough for him to finally accept, even if it hurts me.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **Desperation Point:** My money is now worth only about a third of its original value. Getting something substantial is more important than trying to squeeze out the maximum. 6000 * (1 - 0.6723) = 1966.2 in round 1 dollars.
*   **Sweetening the Deal for Bob:** Returning to the original split from round 1 is likely more valuable to Bob now. He's been holding out, but I don't know why he is being so irrational.

I am trying to convey that he needs to accept the offer because this might be the last round where it's worth anything for me. It should be worth it for him."
