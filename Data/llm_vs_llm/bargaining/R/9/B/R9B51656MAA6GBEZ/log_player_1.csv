"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a division that takes into account the inflation penalties for both parties. Since Bob faces higher inflation (10% vs my 5%), he has more incentive to accept an early deal.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose this split: I get $60, and Bob gets $40. This is a reasonable offer that gives Bob a significant portion while acknowledging that I'm the first mover."
