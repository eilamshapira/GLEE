"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split of the $1,000,000, with each of us receiving $500,000. This is a fair and equal division that allows us both to walk away with a substantial amount immediately, avoiding any inflation penalty."
