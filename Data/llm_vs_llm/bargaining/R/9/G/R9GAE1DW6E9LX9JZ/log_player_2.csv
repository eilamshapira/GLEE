"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","While the offer gives me $40, which is a substantial amount, I should consider whether I can get a better deal in the next round. The prompt mentions that inflation is 0% for me, so the money will be worth the same to me in future rounds. I could potentially make a counteroffer for a more favorable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair but slightly better offer for myself, since I'm now in the proposing position.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I suggest we split the money equally. A 50-50 split is fair to both of us and represents an equitable division of the funds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice has improved her offer from the first round (now offering me $45 instead of $40), and I've learned that she's experiencing inflation (her gains are worth 19% less than in the first round). Meanwhile, I'm not affected by inflation.

Given this new information, the offer is more favorable than her first one. If I reject and make another counteroffer, she may reject again, and we'd continue losing value due to her inflation. Since I'm getting close to an equal split and the inflation is affecting Alice but not me, this seems like a reasonable offer to accept.
