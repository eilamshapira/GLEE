"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair. I take the lion's share, but you get a decent start. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $100,000 out of $1,000,000 (10% of the total)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 20% inflation, the money will be worth less next round
4. $100,000 now is better than a larger sum that's worth less due to inflation

While the split heavily favors Alice, getting $100,000 now is still a significant amount, and the inflation penalty makes waiting risky. If I reject and propose next round, Alice might reject my offer, leading to further rounds and more value loss.
