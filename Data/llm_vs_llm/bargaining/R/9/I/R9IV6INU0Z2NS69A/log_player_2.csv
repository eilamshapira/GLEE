"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose an equal split that's fair to both of us. If we delay too long, we both lose due to inflation, so I suggest we agree quickly on this 50-50 division. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split ($500,000 each)
2. This is a fair and equal division
3. Alice makes a valid point about inflation (20% loss per round)
4. If I reject, the next round's total value would be worth $800,000 (20% less)
5. Even if I propose a more favorable split next round, the total amount to divide would be less

Given these factors, this is actually a very reasonable first offer. A 50-50 split is fair, and trying to negotiate for more would likely result in both of us losing money due to inflation.
