"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'd like to propose that I receive $60 and you get $40. I believe this division reflects the fairness of our negotiation. Looking forward to your thoughts! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100, which means I would get 40% of the total amount. While this isn't an even split, if I reject it, I'll get to make a counter-offer in the next round. However, she could then reject my offer, leading to further rounds and potentially lost time. Since $40 is still a substantial amount and not unreasonable, I might accept to conclude the negotiation efficiently.
