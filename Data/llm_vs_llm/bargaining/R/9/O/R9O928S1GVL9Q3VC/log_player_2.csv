"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 487179 
# Alice gain: 512821 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Alice's offer where I would get $487,179 and she would get $512,821. Let me think about this strategically...

If I reject, I can make my own offer in round 2, but the total amount will be worth 5% less (so $950,000 total). While I could propose a more favorable split for myself, Alice might reject, leading to further devaluation in round 3.

Alice's current offer is close to a 49/51 split, which is fairly reasonable. If I reject, we risk losing value through inflation, and there's no guarantee I'll end up with more money after negotiations.
