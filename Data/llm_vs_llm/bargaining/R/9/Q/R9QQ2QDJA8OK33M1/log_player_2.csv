"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, giving me a slight edge to account for potential future rounds. Deal? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering a 45-55 split in her favor. Given that we have inflation of 10% per round for me, waiting to make a counter-offer would diminish the real value of my share. If I reject and propose in round 2, my money would only be worth 90% of its original value, so a higher numerical amount might still be worth less in real terms.

45$ now is better than potentially getting slightly more in the next round but with 10% inflation. The fair split would be 50-50, but the 5$ difference isn't worth the risk of losing value through inflation.
