"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate this offer carefully.

Alice is offering me $4,000 out of the $10,000, which is 40% of the total. If I reject, I'll make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation.

If I reject and propose in round 2, I'd be dividing an effectively smaller pot (for me). Even if I could get a better percentage in the next round, I need to consider whether that would outweigh the 5% inflation penalty.

$4,000 now is better than potentially getting nothing if we can't agree within 12 rounds, and it's a substantial portion of the money.
