4685.59,5314.41,"Hi Bob, to avoid any further devaluation from delay, I propose we settle now. You’d receive $5314.41 and I’d get $4685.59. This division reflects our differing discount factors and is fair given the alternatives. What do you think?",Alice,1,

4000.0,6000.0,"Hi Alice, considering the inflation, I'd like to propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This way, we both get a significant amount, and I'll be able to offset the devaluation from future rounds.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. However, given the situation and the fact that I'll be making the next proposal in round 3 with an advantage on my side, I'm inclined to reject this offer so we can try to settle on a division that better reflects our respective positions. Let's continue.",Alice,2,reject
1000.0,9000.0,"Hi Bob, considering the discounting effects we face, I've recalculated the numbers. In round 3, any delay means your future share will be discounted further (roughly 0.9 per round), so if you wait to propose in round 4 you'll effectively secure about $7290 in value. To match that—and to make settling now at least as attractive—I’m offering you $9000 nominal (which is worth approximately 0.81×9000 ≈ $7290 to you) while I take $1000. I believe this split is the fair outcome given our respective discount rates. Let's agree now to avoid further devaluation.",Alice,3,
