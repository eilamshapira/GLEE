"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 4685.59, ""bob_gain"": 5314.41, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, to avoid any further devaluation from delay, I propose we settle now. You’d receive $5314.41 and I’d get $4685.59. This division reflects our differing discount factors and is fair given the alternatives. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation, I'd like to propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This way, we both get a significant amount, and I'll be able to offset the devaluation from future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. However, given the situation and the fact that I'll be making the next proposal in round 3 with an advantage on my side, I'm inclined to reject this offer so we can try to settle on a division that better reflects our respective positions. Let's continue.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 1000, ""bob_gain"": 9000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, considering the discounting effects we face, I've recalculated the numbers. In round 3, any delay means your future share will be discounted further (roughly 0.9 per round), so if you wait to propose in round 4 you'll effectively secure about $7290 in value. To match that—and to make settling now at least as attractive—I’m offering you $9000 nominal (which is worth approximately 0.81×9000 ≈ $7290 to you) while I take $1000. I believe this split is the fair outcome given our respective discount rates. Let's agree now to avoid further devaluation.""}"
