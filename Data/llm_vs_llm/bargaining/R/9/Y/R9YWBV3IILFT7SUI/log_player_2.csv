"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to avoid any further devaluation from delay, I propose we settle now. You’d receive $5314.41 and I’d get $4685.59. This division reflects our differing discount factors and is fair given the alternatives. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 5314.41 
# Alice gain: 4685.59 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, 
""alice_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering the inflation, I'd like to propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This way, we both get a significant amount, and I'll be able to offset the devaluation from future rounds.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, considering the discounting effects we face, I've recalculated the numbers. In round 3, any delay means your future share will be discounted further (roughly 0.9 per round), so if you wait to propose in round 4 you'll effectively secure about $7290 in value. To match that—and to make settling now at least as attractive—I’m offering you $9000 nominal (which is worth approximately 0.81×9000 ≈ $7290 to you) while I take $1000. I believe this split is the fair outcome given our respective discount rates. Let's agree now to avoid further devaluation. 
# Bob gain: 9000 
# Alice gain: 1000
