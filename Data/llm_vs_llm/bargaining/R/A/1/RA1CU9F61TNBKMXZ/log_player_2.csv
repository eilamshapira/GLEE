"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering Alice's offer:
- I would get $100,000
- Alice would get $900,000
- This is only 10% of the total sum for me
- If I reject, I can make a counter-offer, but the total will be worth 20% less to me

While $100,000 is a substantial amount, it's a very small portion of the total. If I reject, I can propose a more equitable split in the next round. Even with 20% inflation for me, I could still potentially get a better outcome.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more balanced while acknowledging the inflation pressure I'm facing.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose an equal split of the money. This is fair to both of us, and while I'm facing inflation pressure that makes delay costly for me, a 50-50 split represents a balanced compromise."
