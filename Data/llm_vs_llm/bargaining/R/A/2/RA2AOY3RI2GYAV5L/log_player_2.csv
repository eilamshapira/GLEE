"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split.  I take the majority as I'm making the first offer. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The offer of only $10 for me is far too low, even considering the 20% inflation penalty for waiting. I'll make a counter-proposal in the next round that's more balanced."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I propose a more balanced split. Since there's 20% inflation per round affecting me, this is a fair offer that benefits us both.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try a slightly more even split.  Inflation is a factor, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Even with 36% inflation, $20 is still too low. Since I now know inflation doesn't affect Alice, I can better evaluate the situation. I'll make a more strategic counter-offer in the next round, considering that my bargaining power decreases with each round due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I know inflation doesn't affect you, but it affects me significantly. This split is fair considering we both want to avoid further rounds where my share loses more value.""}"
