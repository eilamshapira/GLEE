"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hey Bob, I propose a division where I take $60 and you get $40. This ensures we're both walking away with a fair share, considering the inflation effect. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose an even split of $50 for each of us. This way, we both receive a substantial amount before inflation reduces its value further. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
