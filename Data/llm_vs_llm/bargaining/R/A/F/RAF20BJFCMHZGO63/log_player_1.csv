Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"":50,""bob_gain"":50,""message"":""Let's start with a fair split. How about we both get $50?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for starting with a fair offer. I'd like to propose a slightly different split of $55 for me and $45 for you. Since inflation doesn't affect me, I'm comfortable negotiating, but I also want to reach an agreement without going through too many rounds. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
