"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. How about we both get $50? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer. She's proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair on the surface. Since there's no inflation for me, I don't lose value by continuing to negotiate, but there's also risk in rejecting a reasonable offer if we run out of rounds.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a slightly different offer to see if Alice is flexible in the negotiation.

{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Thanks for starting with a fair offer. I'd like to propose a slightly different split of $55 for me and $45 for you. Since inflation doesn't affect me, I'm comfortable negotiating, but I also want to reach an agreement without going through too many rounds.""}"
