"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's fair 50-50 split offer. This is an equitable division that benefits both of us equally, and there's no reason to risk further rounds of negotiation when we have a fair solution."
