"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me propose a fair split, considering that inflation affects my gains but not Bob's. 

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because while it gives me a slightly larger share, it accounts for the 5% inflation penalty I face if Bob rejects and we move to subsequent rounds. This is a reasonable first offer that gives both of us a substantial portion while protecting me somewhat from inflation effects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 460000 
# Bob gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While it's less than my initial proposal, the 5% inflation penalty means that if I reject and we continue to future rounds, my gains will be worth even less. $460,000 at 5% inflation is better than risking further devaluation of my share in subsequent rounds. This is a reasonable compromise that gives both of us a substantial portion of the money."
