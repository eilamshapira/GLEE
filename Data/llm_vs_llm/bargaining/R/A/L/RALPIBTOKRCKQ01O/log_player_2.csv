"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I believe a fair split would be 60 for me and 40 for you. Let's settle this amicably! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer doesn't seem very fair to me. She's asking for a 60/40 split in her favor without providing a compelling reason why she should get more than half. Since there's only a 5% inflation penalty per round, it makes sense for me to reject this and make my own proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable division and explain my reasoning.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""I think a 50/50 split is the fairest approach since we both have equal standing in this game. This way we both walk away with the maximum collective value instead of losing money to inflation. Let's be fair and efficient.""}"
