"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: A fair split, considering the inflation impact on me. Let's secure a good deal now! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $400,000 and taking $600,000
2. If I reject, the money's value for Alice will decrease by 10% next round
3. This means in the next round, $600,000 will only be worth $540,000 to her
4. This gives me negotiating leverage, as I'm not affected by inflation
5. Given that I can make the next offer and Alice's money will be worth less, I can likely get a better deal

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a strategic offer considering Alice's inflation pressure:

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Since your money loses 10% value each round, this offer gives you $450,000 now, which is better than getting less in future rounds. Let's make a deal now.""}

Reasoning:
1. Alice's previous offer shows she wants a significant portion
2. But her money loses 10% value each round
3. $450,000 now is worth more to her than a larger amount later
4. This is a reasonable offer that considers both our interests
5. The message emphasizes the time pressure on her side"
