"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split, giving both of us an equal share.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I believe this is a fair and equitable division that gives us both the same amount. There's no reason for either of us to be treated differently, and this way we can both walk away satisfied."
