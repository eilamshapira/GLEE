6000.0,4000.0,I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm affected by 5% inflation each round while you're not. This is fair and gives us both a good outcome without risking value loss.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Let's go with an even split this time. We both contribute equally, so a 50-50 division is fair. This way we both benefit equally and avoid any further devaluations.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Due to the 10% cumulative inflation affecting my share now, I need a slightly higher amount to achieve fair value. This 55-45 split compensates for my inflation loss while still giving you a substantial portion. If we continue further rounds, we both lose value.",Alice,3,
