"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's go with an even split this time. We both contribute equally, so a 50-50 division is fair. This way we both benefit equally and avoid any further devaluations. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer because with the 5% inflation affecting my share, I would effectively only get $4,750 in round 1 value, while Bob gets the full $5,000. Let me make a new proposal in the next round that accounts for this inflation factor."
