"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm affected by 5% inflation each round while you're not. This is fair and gives us both a good outcome without risking value loss. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's go with an even split this time. We both contribute equally, so a 50-50 division is fair. This way we both benefit equally and avoid any further devaluations.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Due to the 10% cumulative inflation affecting my share now, I need a slightly higher amount to achieve fair value. This 55-45 split compensates for my inflation loss while still giving you a substantial portion. If we continue further rounds, we both lose value. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
