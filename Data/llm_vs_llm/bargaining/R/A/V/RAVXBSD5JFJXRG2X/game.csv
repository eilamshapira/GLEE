500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I believe a 50-50 split is more fair. We both face inflation penalties with each round (10% for me, 5% for you), so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. This even split respects both of our positions in the negotiation.",Bob,2,
