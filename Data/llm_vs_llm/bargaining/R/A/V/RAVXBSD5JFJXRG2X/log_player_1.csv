Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"":950000,""bob_gain"":50000,""message"":""Let's start with a generous offer. I believe we can reach an agreement here.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I believe a 50-50 split is more fair. We both face inflation penalties with each round (10% for me, 5% for you), so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. This even split respects both of our positions in the negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
