"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a generous offer. I believe we can reach an agreement here. 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer.

She's offering me $50,000 of the $1,000,000, which is 5% of the total, while keeping $950,000 (95%) for herself.

If I reject this offer, we move to the next round where I can make a counter-proposal. However, I need to account for the inflation effect:
- For me, the money will be worth 10% less each round
- For Alice, the money will be worth 5% less each round

This gives me some negotiating leverage, as Alice has less incentive to delay than I do. I believe I can secure a significantly better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more equitable counter-offer while considering our different inflation rates.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I believe a 50-50 split is more fair. We both face inflation penalties with each round (10% for me, 5% for you), so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. This even split respects both of our positions in the negotiation.""}"
