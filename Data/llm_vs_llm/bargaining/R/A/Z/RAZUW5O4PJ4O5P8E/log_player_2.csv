"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair and equal, Bob. We both stand to gain equally this way! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be efficient, Alice.  This round ensures a larger share for me, and we both avoid further losses from inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's balance this out a bit more, Bob. This offer gives you the majority share and keeps us both ahead before more inflation hits. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This offer is better than I could hope to get in a future round after more inflation. While I could push for a tiny bit more, the risk of Alice rejecting and the subsequent inflation makes this offer reasonable to accept."
