"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}

I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor. Given that I face 20% inflation per round, I need to secure a larger portion now to make up for the diminishing value. This is a fair offer that still gives you a substantial amount while acknowledging my greater urgency due to inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
