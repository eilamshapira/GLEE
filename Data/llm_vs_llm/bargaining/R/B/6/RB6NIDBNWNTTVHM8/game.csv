600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get a substantial amount right away without risking inflation.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, with inflation hitting us, I propose a more favorable split for both of us. This offer secures a significant amount for me while still giving you a healthy sum. Let's end this quickly before the money loses more value!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
750000.0,250000.0,"Bob, due to the 20% inflation penalty I'm facing each round, I need a larger nominal amount to receive a fair value. My 750k would actually be worth 600k to me now due to inflation. This is a fair split considering our different inflation rates, and we should agree quickly before further value erosion.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, this is a generous offer considering the impact of inflation on the deal. We both need to secure a good amount. Let's agree now and move on.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
850000.0,150000.0,"Bob, let's be realistic about our different inflation rates. My 850k would only be worth around 435k to me now due to my severe 48.8% inflation hit, while your 150k is only reduced by 14.26%. This actually creates a much more balanced real value than it appears. We need to finish this soon as my inflation penalty is severe.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"Alice, this is a very beneficial offer for you at this stage! Inflation is hurting us both. I believe this offers you a great sum. Let's take this deal before things get worse.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
900000.0,100000.0,"Bob, let's analyze the real values: my 900k is only worth about 295k to me after my 67.23% inflation hit. Your 100k, with your 22.62% inflation, is worth about 77k to you. While the nominal split looks extreme, the real values are much closer. We must conclude this soon as my inflation rate is severely eroding any potential gain.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"Alice, this is my final and very generous offer. Consider the benefits to you, and let's settle now before it's too late for both of us.",Bob,8,
