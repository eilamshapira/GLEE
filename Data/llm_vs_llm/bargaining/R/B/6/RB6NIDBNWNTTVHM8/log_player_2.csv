Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, due to the 20% inflation penalty I'm facing each round, I need a larger nominal amount to receive a fair value. My 750k would actually be worth 600k to me now due to inflation. This is a fair split considering our different inflation rates, and we should agree quickly before further value erosion.

Round 5

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic about our different inflation rates. My 850k would only be worth around 435k to me now due to my severe 48.8% inflation hit, while your 150k is only reduced by 14.26%. This actually creates a much more balanced real value than it appears. We need to finish this soon as my inflation penalty is severe.

While the nominal split looks extreme, the real values are much closer. We must conclude this soon as my inflation rate is severely eroding any potential gain.
