Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'd like to propose a fair division where I get $600,000 and you get $400,000. This gives you a substantial portion while recognizing that inflation will affect my share more severely in later rounds if we don't reach an agreement now."
