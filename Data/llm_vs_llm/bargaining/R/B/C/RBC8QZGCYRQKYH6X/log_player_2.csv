"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me $400,000 while taking $600,000 for herself.

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but I need to consider that:
1. The money will be worth 20% less to me in the next round
2. Alice could reject my counter-offer, leading to further rounds and more value loss
3. We have a 12-round limit before we both get nothing

$400,000 right now is better than $500,000 in the next round (which would actually be worth $400,000 to me due to 20% inflation). While the split isn't entirely equal, it's a reasonable first offer that gives me a significant portion without risking value loss from inflation.
