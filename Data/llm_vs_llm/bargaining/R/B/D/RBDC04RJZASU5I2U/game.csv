55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a slightly favorable split for me at 55/45. Let's avoid prolonged negotiations as the money loses value for both of us with each round, especially for me (10% vs your 5%). This is a fair first offer considering these inflation rates.",Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Alice, I understand your initial proposal, but I believe a 55/45 split is more equitable considering our respective inflation rates. Let's meet in the middle, and avoid any further rounds of negotiation.",Bob,2,

50.0,50.0,"Bob, I propose a perfectly equal 50/50 split. While you suggested 55/45 in your favor, I believe an even split is the fairest solution. Remember that we're both losing value with each round - I'm now at 20% cumulative inflation and you're at 10%. Let's finalize this deal now with a fair and balanced division.",Alice,3,
