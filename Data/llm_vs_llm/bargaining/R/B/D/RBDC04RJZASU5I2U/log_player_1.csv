"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a slightly favorable split for me at 55/45. Let's avoid prolonged negotiations as the money loses value for both of us with each round, especially for me (10% vs your 5%). This is a fair first offer considering these inflation rates.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your initial proposal, but I believe a 55/45 split is more equitable considering our respective inflation rates. Let's meet in the middle, and avoid any further rounds of negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Bob, I propose a perfectly equal 50/50 split. While you suggested 55/45 in your favor, I believe an even split is the fairest solution. Remember that we're both losing value with each round - I'm now at 20% cumulative inflation and you're at 10%. Let's finalize this deal now with a fair and balanced division.""}"
