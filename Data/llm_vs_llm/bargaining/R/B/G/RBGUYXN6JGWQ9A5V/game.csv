9000.0,1000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a round‐1 split: I take $9000 and you get $1000. By agreeing now, we both avoid any potential loss from inflation in later rounds. I believe this is a smart, efficient deal for both of us. Let me know if you accept.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, let's be fair and split it equally. This way, we both get the same amount and avoid any further loss due to inflation. It's a win-win situation.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, I appreciate the fairness in your equal split offer, but I believe we can do better by proceeding to the next round. Since my share isn’t affected by inflation while yours is, I have strong incentives to wait and propose a division that accounts for this imbalance. Let’s move on to round 3.",Alice,2,reject
3300.0,6700.0,"Hi Bob, here’s my round‐3 offer. Due to the inflation mechanics, any money allocated to you now gets devalued—roughly 40% off compared to round 1—while my share remains at full value. To avoid further losses on your end by delaying the agreement, I'm offering you $6700 (which amounts to about $4020 in round‐1 terms) and keeping $3300 for myself. This deal is designed to match what you might expect if you wait, but it saves us both more value. I believe it’s a fair and efficient way forward. Let me know if you accept.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, considering the inflation, I'm now offering to take $6000 and leave you $4000. This is still a fair deal given the circumstances. Let's agree on this to avoid further losses.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, I appreciate that you're trying to keep the deal fair, but given the inflation penalties you're facing, it’s in my best interest to hold out a bit longer. My full-value share remains at $10000 regardless of the round, so I believe we can craft an even more favorable split if we keep negotiating. Let’s move on to round 5 and work towards a deal that reflects these changing values.",Alice,4,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"Hi Bob, in round 5 the inflation on your share has worsened – any dollar you receive now is worth about 55% less than in round 1. With that in mind, waiting further will only diminish your effective gains. I’m proposing a split where you get $7000 (which effectively converts to around $3150 in round‐1 value) and I receive $3000 at full value. This offer gives you a slight improvement over your previous expectation and acknowledges the steeper inflation on your share. I believe it’s a fair compromise given our circumstances. Let’s avoid further losses and agree on this deal.",Alice,5,
