"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a round‐1 split: I take $9000 and you get $1000. By agreeing now, we both avoid any potential loss from inflation in later rounds. I believe this is a smart, efficient deal for both of us. Let me know if you accept.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be fair and split it equally. This way, we both get the same amount and avoid any further loss due to inflation. It's a win-win situation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate the fairness in your equal split offer, but I believe we can do better by proceeding to the next round. Since my share isn’t affected by inflation while yours is, I have strong incentives to wait and propose a division that accounts for this imbalance. Let’s move on to round 3.""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 3300, ""bob_gain"": 6700, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here’s my round‐3 offer. Due to the inflation mechanics, any money allocated to you now gets devalued—roughly 40% off compared to round 1—while my share remains at full value. To avoid further losses on your end by delaying the agreement, I'm offering you $6700 (which amounts to about $4020 in round‐1 terms) and keeping $3300 for myself. This deal is designed to match what you might expect if you wait, but it saves us both more value. I believe it’s a fair and efficient way forward. Let me know if you accept.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the inflation, I'm now offering to take $6000 and leave you $4000. This is still a fair deal given the circumstances. Let's agree on this to avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate that you're trying to keep the deal fair, but given the inflation penalties you're facing, it’s in my best interest to hold out a bit longer. My full-value share remains at $10,000 regardless of the round, so I believe we can craft an even more favorable split if we keep negotiating. Let’s move on to round 5 and work towards a deal that reflects these changing values.""}"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 3000, ""bob_gain"": 7000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, in round 5 the inflation on your share has worsened – any dollar you receive now is worth about 55% less than in round 1. With that in mind, waiting further will only diminish your effective gains. I’m proposing a split where you get $7000 (which effectively converts to around $3150 in round‐1 value) and I receive $3000 at full value. This offer gives you a slight improvement over your previous expectation and acknowledges the steeper inflation on your share. I believe it’s a fair compromise given our circumstances. Let’s avoid further losses and agree on this deal.""}"
