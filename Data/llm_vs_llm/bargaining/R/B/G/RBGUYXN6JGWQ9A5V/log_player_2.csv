"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a round‐1 split: I take $9000 and you get $1000. By agreeing now, we both avoid any potential loss from inflation in later rounds. I believe this is a smart, efficient deal for both of us. Let me know if you accept.

# Alice gain: 9000

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be fair and split it equally. This way, we both get the same amount and avoid any further loss due to inflation. It's a win-win situation.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here’s my round‐3 offer. Due to the inflation mechanics, any money allocated to you now gets devalued—roughly 40% off compared to round 1—while my share remains at full value. To avoid further losses on your end by delaying the agreement, I'm offering you $6700 (which amounts to about $4020 in round‐1 terms) and keeping $3300 for myself. This deal is designed to match what you might expect if you wait, but it saves us both more value. I believe it’s a fair and efficient way forward. Let me know if you accept. 
# Bob gain: 6700 
# Alice gain: 3300

Round 4

This is still a fair deal given the circumstances. Let's agree on this to avoid further losses.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in round 5 the inflation on your share has worsened – any dollar you receive now is worth about 55% less than in round 1. With that in mind, waiting further will only diminish your effective gains. I’m proposing a split where you get $7000 (which effectively converts to around $3150 in round‐1 value) and I receive $3000 at full value. This offer gives you a slight improvement over your previous expectation and acknowledges the steeper inflation on your share. I believe it’s a fair compromise given our circumstances. Let’s avoid further losses and agree on this deal. 
# Bob gain: 7000 
# Alice gain: 3000
