"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. Remember the inflation; my gains are decreasing more rapidly than yours. This is a much better deal for both of us than your previous offer. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
