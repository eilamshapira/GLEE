Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my initial proposal: I take $600,000 and you take $400,000. I believe this division is fair given that the money loses value for me with each round. Let me know your thoughts!""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concern about the money losing value. However, I think a fair split would be more appropriate given that the money retains its value for me. Let's split it equally at $500000 each. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
