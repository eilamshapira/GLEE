"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get your money immediately without any inflation impact. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $4,000 now
2. If I reject, the next round's $10,000 will be worth only $8,000 to me due to 20% inflation
3. In the next round, I could propose a split, but Alice might reject it, leading to further rounds and more inflation
4. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush, and $4,000 now is actually quite reasonable considering the inflation risk
5. If we keep going back and forth, we might end up with much less due to inflation

While 60-40 split in Alice's favor isn't ideal, it's a reasonable first offer and the inflation risk makes immediate acceptance attractive.
