"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me think strategically. Since Bob's money loses value faster than mine (20% vs 5% per round), he has more incentive to accept an early offer. However, I don't want to be too greedy and risk rejection.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this 60-40 split because:
1. It gives Bob a significant portion ($4000) which is better than waiting and losing value
2. It's not too greedy, showing respect for fair negotiation
3. If Bob rejects, his next counter-offer will be worth less to him due to the 20% depreciation"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Bob is offering a 50-50 split
2. Due to inflation, my $5000 is actually worth $4750 (5% less)
3. For Bob, his $5000 is worth $4000 (20% less)
4. If I reject, I can make a new offer next round, but:
   - The money will be worth even less for both of us
   - Bob might reject again, leading to further depreciation
5. This is a fair offer, and waiting will only decrease the value

{""decision"": ""accept""}

The 50-50 split is fair, and considering the inflation rates, it's better to accept now than risk further value loss in subsequent rounds."
