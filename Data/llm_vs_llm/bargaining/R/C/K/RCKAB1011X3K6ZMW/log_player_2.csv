"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split the amount equally to ensure we both benefit fairly from this opportunity. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

It's important to start the game with a fair and reasonable offer. Since Alice has offered to split the money equally, it's a good idea to accept this offer. This way, both players get a fair share, and the game ends on a positive note. There's no guarantee that future offers will be as fair, and since the value of the money doesn't decrease for me, accepting this offer is a sensible decision."
