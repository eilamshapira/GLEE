"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I want to propose a fair division that acknowledges the impact of inflation and our mutual interest in reaching a timely agreement.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an equal split of the $10,000. This is fair and equitable for both of us, and avoids the 10% loss of value that would occur if we moved to another round. A 50-50 split respects both our interests equally."
