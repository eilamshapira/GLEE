Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose an equal 50-50 split. That way, we both benefit equally, making it perfectly fair for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a fair and reasonable offer. A 50-50 split is equitable for both parties, and accepting it now guarantees us both a significant sum rather than risking further rounds of negotiation that might lead to less favorable outcomes."
