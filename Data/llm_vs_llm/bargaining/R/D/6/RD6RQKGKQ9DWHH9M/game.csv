600000.0,400000.0,I propose a 60/40 split in my favor given that the money's value decreases faster for me than for you.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Let's split it equally. This way, we both get a fair share and avoid the risk of losing value over rounds.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"I understand your point, but considering the inflation rates, I propose 55/45. This way, you stay ahead despite the higher inflation impact on your share.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
480000.0,520000.0,"Considering the inflation rates, I propose a 52/48 split in my favor. This is still advantageous for you compared to the devaluation you'd face in future rounds.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
525000.0,475000.0,Let's meet in the middle with a 52.5/47.5 split. This gives you more than previous rounds and addresses the inflation impact on both sides. It's a reasonable compromise.,Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,accept
