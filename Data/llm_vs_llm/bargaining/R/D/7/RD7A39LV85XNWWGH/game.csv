6000.0,4000.0,"Hello Bob, I propose we settle this round. I suggest a division in which I receive $6000 and you receive $4000. Considering that delays might reduce the overall value due to inflation (even though it doesn't affect me, I'm not sure about your situation), I believe this is a fair offer if we agree now. Looking forward to your response.",Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. Given the inflation affecting my share, I propose a split of $5500 for me and $4500 for you. This way, we can still settle quickly but with a more balanced division considering the current round's value. What do you think?",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can do better by moving on to the next round. Since the inflation doesn’t affect my share, I’m confident that when it’s my turn to propose in round 3 we can craft an agreement that reflects the changing value dynamics more fairly for both of us. Let’s continue.",Alice,2,reject
4450.0,5550.0,"Hi Bob,

I understand your concerns about inflation affecting your share. In order to avoid further delays—and to help you secure a slightly improved effective value compared to the previous round—I propose the following division of $10000: I receive $4450 and you receive $5550. Given that your money is discounted by 10% compared to the initial round, this means you effectively get about $4995. By agreeing now, you avoid the risk of further devaluation of your share.

I hope you find this offer appealing enough to settle promptly.",Alice,3,
