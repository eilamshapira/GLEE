"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hello Bob, I propose we settle this round. I suggest a division in which I receive $6000 and you receive $4000. Considering that delays might reduce the overall value due to inflation (even though it doesn't affect me, I'm not sure about your situation), I believe this is a fair offer if we agree now. Looking forward to your response.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. Given the inflation affecting my share, I propose a split of $5500 for me and $4500 for you. This way, we can still settle quickly but with a more balanced division considering the current round's value. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can do better by moving on to the next round. Since the inflation doesn’t affect my share, I’m confident that when it’s my turn to propose in round 3 we can craft an agreement that reflects the changing value dynamics more fairly for both of us. Let’s continue.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 4450, ""bob_gain"": 5550, ""message"": ""Hi Bob,\n\nI understand your concerns about inflation affecting your share. In order to avoid further delays—and to help you secure a slightly improved effective value compared to the previous round—I propose the following division of $10,000: I receive $4,450 and you receive $5,550. Given that your money is discounted by 10% compared to the initial round, this means you effectively get about $4,995. By agreeing now, you avoid the risk of further devaluation of your share.\n\nI hope you find this offer appealing enough to settle promptly.""}"
