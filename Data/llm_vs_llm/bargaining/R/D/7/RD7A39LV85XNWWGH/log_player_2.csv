"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I propose we settle this round. I suggest a division in which I receive $6000 and you receive $4000. Considering that delays might reduce the overall value due to inflation (even though it doesn't affect me, I'm not sure about your situation), I believe this is a fair offer if we agree now. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. Given the inflation affecting my share, I propose a split of $5500 for me and $4500 for you. This way, we can still settle quickly but with a more balanced division considering the current round's value. What do you think?""
}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob,

I understand your concerns about inflation affecting your share. In order to avoid further delays—and to help you secure a slightly improved effective value compared to the previous round—I propose the following division of $10000: I receive $4450 and you receive $5550. Given that your money is discounted by 10% compared to the initial round, this means you effectively get about $4995. By agreeing now, you avoid the risk of further devaluation of your share.

I hope you find this offer appealing enough to settle promptly. 
# Bob gain: 5550 
# Alice gain: 4450
