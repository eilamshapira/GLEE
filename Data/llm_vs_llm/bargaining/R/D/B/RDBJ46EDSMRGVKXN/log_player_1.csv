"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's settle this now with an even split: $500K for each. Every round we wait costs me dearly due to inflation, and I believe a fair 50-50 division benefits us both. Let's avoid further losses and agree today! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
