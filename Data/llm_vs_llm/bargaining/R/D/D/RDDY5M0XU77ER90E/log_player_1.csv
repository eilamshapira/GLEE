Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose a 50-50 split. This is fair and gives us both a good outcome. Remember that inflation affects me more severely (20% vs your 10%), so continuing to future rounds would disadvantage me more than you. This equal split is better for both of us than continuing further rounds. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
