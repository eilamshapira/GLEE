"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. I think this is a fair split to start with. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

Alice is offering me $4,000 out of the $10,000, which means she would get $6,000.

If I reject and we move to the next round, I need to consider:
- The money will be worth 20% less to me (so the $10,000 would effectively be worth $8,000 to me)
- For Alice, the money will be worth 10% less (so the $10,000 would be worth $9,000 to her)
- However, I would get to make the next proposal

Since Alice's current offer gives me $4,000, and rejecting would mean the total pot is worth only $8,000 to me in the next round, I would need to secure more than 50% of the pot in my counter-offer to do better than $4,000.

I think I can make a better offer in the next round, so I'll reject this.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that accounts for our different inflation rates while being reasonably fair.

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, I propose a 50-50 split. This is fair and gives us both a good outcome. Remember that inflation affects me more severely (20% vs your 10%), so continuing to future rounds would disadvantage me more than you. This equal split is better for both of us than continuing further rounds.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you offering a 50/50 split, but it's important to consider that my initial offer would have netted you a larger sum in the long run. Let's meet in the middle – this offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

Alice is offering me $4,200 out of the $10,000, which means she would get $5,800.

Due to inflation:
- For me (Bob), the money is now worth 36% less than in round 1
- For Alice, the money is worth 19% less than in round 1

If I reject and we move to round 4:
- The money would be worth even less (about 49% less for me, and 27% less for Alice)
- I would get to make the next proposal, but the total value continues to decrease

Current offer value to me: $4,200 × (1 - 0.36) = $2,688 in round 1 terms

If I reject and make a perfect offer next round, the maximum I could get would be $10,000, but that would be worth only $10,000 × (1 - 0.49) = $5,100 in round 1 terms. However, Alice would likely reject such an extreme offer.

Given the significant inflation penalty I face and that Alice has increased her offer, I'll accept this offer.
