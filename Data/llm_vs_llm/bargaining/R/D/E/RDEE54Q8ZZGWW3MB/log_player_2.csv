"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I propose this split because:
1. Due to 20% inflation, the money is now worth less to me than in round 1
2. I'm offering Alice a substantial amount while ensuring I get a fair share
3. This is a more balanced proposal than Alice's initial 20-80 split"
