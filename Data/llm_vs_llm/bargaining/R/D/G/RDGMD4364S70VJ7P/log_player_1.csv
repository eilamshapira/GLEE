Round 3

{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Bob, we're running out of time. My offer is still the most sensible choice.""
}
```

I'm sticking with the same offer for now. Bob's valuation of the money is decreasing slower than mine, so he needs to feel some pressure from the shrinking pot."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

While this seems like an equal split on the surface, due to the different inflation rates, this is actually much more beneficial to Bob than to me.  I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5700,
""bob_gain"": 4300,
""message"": ""This is my final offer, Bob.  Let's be realistic and close this deal.""
}
```

I'm compromising slightly to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to make it clear this is my final offer. The time pressure is significant now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a solid offer that provides you with a good amount too. Let's finalize it. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

This is a tough one, but I have to reject it. While the time pressure is immense, this offer heavily favors Bob, even considering the inflation.  I'm hoping he'll become more reasonable in the next round as the deadline approaches."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, we're down to the wire. This is a compromise to end this now.""
}
```

I'm moving closer to a middle ground here. It stings to concede this much, but with the deadline approaching, I need to make sure we reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the urgency; this offer gives you a fair share while maximizing my portion. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

This is far from ideal, but with the time pressure and considering the inflation, rejecting this offer would be too risky. I'm losing a significant chunk of the potential gain, but getting nothing is worse at this point."
