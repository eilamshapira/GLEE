75.0,25.0,"Alice, consider that every extra round reduces the value of your money by 20%. If you reject now, waiting will leave you with only $60 worth in round 3 even if you claim almost all of the $100. To avoid that loss, I propose we agree now: I take $25 and you get $75 nominal (worth $75Ã—0.8 = $60 for you). Accept this offer.",Bob,2,
