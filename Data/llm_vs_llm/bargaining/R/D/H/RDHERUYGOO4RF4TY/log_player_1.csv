"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, consider that every extra round reduces the value of your money by 20%. If you reject now, waiting will leave you with only $60 worth in round 3 even if you claim almost all of the $100. To avoid that loss, I propose we agree now: I take $25 and you get $75 nominal (worth $75Ã—0.8 = $60 for you). Accept this offer. 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
