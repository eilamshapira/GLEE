"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40. This is a fair start considering the inflation affects me more.

# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 25, ""alice_gain"": 75, ""message"": ""Alice, consider that every extra round reduces the value of your money by 20%. If you reject now, waiting will leave you with only $60 worth in round 3 even if you claim almost all of the $100. To avoid that loss, I propose we agree now: I take $25 and you get $75 nominal (worth $75Ã—0.8 = $60 for you). Accept this offer.""}"
