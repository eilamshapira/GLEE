"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering me $40 while keeping $60 for herself. Since we're only in the first round, and each subsequent round would decrease the value of my share by 5%, I should carefully consider this offer.

If I reject and propose in the next round, the total value would be worth 5% less to me. So even if I proposed a 50/50 split in round 2, my $50 would only be worth $47.50 to me due to the 5% inflation.

Since $40 now is better than the possibility of $47.50 in the next round (which Alice might reject anyway), I'll accept this offer.
