# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is heavily skewed in Bob's favor. While the decreasing value due to inflation is a concern, accepting such a low offer would set a bad precedent and likely lead to even worse offers from Bob in subsequent rounds."

# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is a tough one, but I still have to reject. Bob is clearly trying to pressure me with the ""last chance"" talk, but the offer is too heavily skewed in his favor.  I need to show him I'm serious about getting a fair deal, even with the inflation pressure."

# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is incredibly frustrating, but I can't accept this offer. Bob is clearly trying to exploit the situation, and accepting such a low amount would be disastrous. I'm hoping he'll start to negotiate more reasonably soon, as the increasing inflation is hurting him too."

# Alice gain: 1500 
# Bob gain: 8500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is absurd! While I understand the pressure of the situation, accepting such a paltry sum would be a mistake. I have to believe Bob will come to his senses in the next round."

I'd rather walk away with nothing than accept this insulting offer. Bob has shown he's not interested in being fair.  It's unfortunate, but I won't be taken advantage of."
