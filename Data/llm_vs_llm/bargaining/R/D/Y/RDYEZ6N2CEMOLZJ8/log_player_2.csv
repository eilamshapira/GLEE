"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's keep it fair and split the $100 evenly. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: I get $50
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
   - The money will be worth 5% less due to inflation
   - Maximum I could get in next round would be $95, but worth only $90.25 after inflation
   - But Alice might reject that, leading to further rounds and more inflation

The current offer of $50 is fair and reasonable. While I could try to negotiate for more, the risk of inflation eating into future gains and the possibility of multiple rejections makes this a solid offer.
