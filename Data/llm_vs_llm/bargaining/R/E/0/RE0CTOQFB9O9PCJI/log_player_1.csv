"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split that slightly favors me since I'm making the first offer. I'll offer Bob a substantial portion to increase the likelihood of acceptance, avoiding the 20% loss from inflation if we go to another round.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

My proposal is: ""I'll take $550,000 and you'll get $450,000. This is a fair split that gives us both substantial gains without risking value loss from inflation."""
