"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if this offer is fair given the game rules and potential future outcomes.

Alice is offering me $450,000 (45%) while taking $550,000 (55%) for herself.

If I reject and we move to round 2, the total money decreases by 20% to $800,000. I would then make a counter-offer. However, if Alice rejects my counter-offer, we'd move to round 3 with only $640,000 remaining.

Since I'm being offered a substantial portion in the first round and the money will continue to lose value with each rejection, this seems like a reasonable offer.
