400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, since each round chips away at the value we can secure, I propose a fair split now: 600k for me and 400k for you. Accepting this offer means you avoid further discounting on your share, so let's agree now and both maximize what we get.",Bob,2,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, waiting only drains the pot further for both of us. In Round 4, I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor, which gives each of us a fair present value considering the inflation effects – my share is discounted by 28% and yours by 52% compared to Round 1. This offer secures you a solid amount compared to the uncertain—and even lower—returns if we delay further. Let's agree now and avoid extra loss for both sides.",Bob,4,
