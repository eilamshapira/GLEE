Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, since each round chips away at the value we can secure, I propose a fair split now: 600k for me and 400k for you. Accepting this offer means you avoid further discounting on your share, so let's agree now and both maximize what we get.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, waiting only drains the pot further for both of us. In Round 4, I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor, which gives each of us a fair present value considering the inflation effects – my share is discounted by 28% and yours by 52% compared to Round 1. This offer secures you a solid amount compared to the uncertain—and even lower—returns if we delay further. Let's agree now and avoid extra loss for both sides. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000
