"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation rate that only affects you, a 55-45 split in my favor seems more reasonable. Let's settle for this, Alice. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
