"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split reflects the importance of early agreement. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $400,000 out of $1,000,000 (40%)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 20% inflation, any amount I get next round will be worth 20% less to me
4. If I reject, $400,000 now would be equivalent to $500,000 in the next round just to break even

While I could try to negotiate for more, the inflation penalty makes this a risky strategy. The current offer gives me a substantial amount, and trying to get more could result in getting less value due to inflation.
