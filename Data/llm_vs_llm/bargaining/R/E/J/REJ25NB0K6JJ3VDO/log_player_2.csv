"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me $200,000 out of the $1M total. Since she faces 20% depreciation per round while I face 0%, I have leverage to negotiate for a better deal. If we go to the next round:
- My $200K would still be worth $200K
- Her $800K would only be worth $640K

I can likely get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round, taking advantage of the depreciation pressure on her share.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice faces 20% depreciation per round while I don't, I can offer her a bit less than her initial offer, but still enough that she should rationally accept rather than risk further depreciation of her share.

If she rejects my offer, in the next round her money would be worth another 20% less. I'll offer her $600,000, which is less than her initial demand but still significantly more than what would be left after another round of depreciation.

{""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""alice_gain"": 600000}

I propose this split where I get $400,000 and Alice gets $600,000."
