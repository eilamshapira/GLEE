"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I'm Alice, I need to propose a division of $10,000, and the money loses value each round (20% for me, 5% for Bob). I have 12 rounds. Here's my initial proposal:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

**Explanation of my strategy:**

*   I'm aiming for a significant initial gain, recognizing that the value of money diminishes quickly for me.
*   I'm offering Bob a substantial amount ($4000) to incentivize him to accept. The initial 5% loss for him is less impactful than my 20% loss.
*   This is a starting point. I'm prepared to adjust my offer in later rounds if necessary, but I want to secure a good chunk of the money upfront."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1667 
# Bob gain: 8333 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, that's a terrible offer from Bob. My $10000 in round 1 is now $8000 in round 2. Bob's $10000 in round 1 is now $9500 in round 2.

Let's calculate the worth of Bob's offer.
Alice gain: 1667 * 0.8 = 1333.6
Bob gain: 8333 * 0.95 = 7916.35
In this round, Alice gain would be 1333.6 and bob gain would be 7916.35.

I reject this offer.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Alright, it's my turn to propose again. Remember, my money is now worth only 64% of the original value (0.8 * 0.8) and Bob's is worth 90.25% (0.95 * 0.95).

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   I'm increasing my share significantly. The value decay is hurting me much more than it's hurting Bob.
*   I'm still offering Bob a reasonable amount of $3000. Considering his money is still worth more than 90% of the original value, this is still attractive to him.
*   I need to secure a larger portion now to offset the continuing devaluation. I will consider going lower in later rounds, but for now, I need to get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3311 
# Bob gain: 6689 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, my money is worth 51.2% and Bob's money is worth 85.74%.

Let's calculate the worth of Bob's offer:
Alice gain: 3311 * 0.512 = 1695.632
Bob gain: 6689 * 0.8574 = 5735.3786

That's still not good enough for me, considering the rate at which my share is diminishing. I need to aim for a higher payout while there's still significant value remaining.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's my turn again. My money is now worth only 40.96% (0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8) of the original value, and Bob's is worth 81.45% (0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95). The situation is becoming increasingly urgent for me.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   I'm pushing for a significantly higher share. With my money losing value so rapidly, I need to secure a substantial amount now.
*   $2500 is still a reasonable amount for Bob, given that his money retains a good portion of its original value. He should realize that this is better than potentially getting nothing if we reach the deadline.
*   I am trying to front-load my earnings as much as possible to mitigate the impact of inflation on my side. I am starting to feel desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 935 
# Bob gain: 9065 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, my money is now worth 32.77% and Bob's money is worth 77.38%.

Let's calculate the worth of Bob's offer:
Alice gain: 935 * 0.3277 = 306.49
Bob gain: 9065 * 0.7738 = 7014.68

This is insulting! My share is worth almost nothing at this point. I cannot accept this.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","This is getting dire. My money is now worth only 26.21% of its original value (0.8^6), while Bob's is still worth 73.51% (0.95^6). I am rapidly approaching a point where anything is better than nothing. However, I have to try one more time for a somewhat reasonable share.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   This is my most aggressive offer yet. I'm essentially demanding the lion's share.
*   Even with only $2000, Bob still gets a good return because his money has not devalued as much as mine. 2000 * 0.7351 = 1470.2
*   I am desperate to secure something substantial before my remaining value vanishes completely. This may be my last chance to get a worthwhile payout."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 709 
# Bob gain: 9291 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, my money is worth 20.97% and Bob's money is worth 69.83%.

Let's calculate the worth of Bob's offer:
Alice gain: 709 * 0.2097 = 148.68
Bob gain: 9291 * 0.6983 = 6487.07

This is an absolutely ridiculous offer, given how little my money is worth! But, with only a few rounds left, I need to start thinking strategically about avoiding a complete loss. I will still reject, but the next round might be acceptance of a bad offer.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, my money is now worth a dismal 16.78% (0.8^8) of its original value, while Bob's is still at 66.34% (0.95^8). The situation is truly desperate. I need to decide if I'm going to gamble on getting anything better, or just take a small loss now. I'm going to try *one* more offer for a decent split, but if that fails, I will accept Bob's next offer no matter how bad.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   It may seem strange to ask for so much at this stage, but even with 6000, my worth is only 6000 * 0.1678 = 1006.8
*   Bob gets 4000 * 0.6634 = 2653.6, which is better than nothing.
*   If he rejects, I will have to accept the next offer no matter what. This is my last 'good' offer before I need to cut my losses. This proposal is made in the hopes that Bob will agree to a solution that leaves both of us with some money. If he rejects, then he will have demonstrated that he does not care about my gains. And in such a case, I must accept the next offer even if its worth to me is almost nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 36.98% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400 
# Bob gain: 9600 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, my money is worth 13.42% and Bob's money is worth 63.02%.

Let's calculate the worth of Bob's offer:
Alice gain: 400 * 0.1342 = 53.68
Bob gain: 9600 * 0.6302 = 6049.92

I am honouring my word. Even though this offer is terrible, I said I would accept Bob's next offer if he rejected my last attempt. I will accept the offer.
