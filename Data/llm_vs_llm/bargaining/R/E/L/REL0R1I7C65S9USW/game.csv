60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a fair 60-40 split in my favor. Due to inflation affecting me, this is reasonable as my money will be worth less with each round.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
50.0,50.0,"Hi Alice, I propose an equal split of 50-50. This way, we both get a fair share.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
65.0,35.0,"Bob, due to 20% inflation affecting my share, I need 65% to get approximately the same real value as your 35%. If we delay further, inflation will force me to ask for even more to maintain equal real value.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, I understand inflation is a concern, but I believe a split of 55-45 is a reasonable offer that both of us can agree on.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
70.0,30.0,"Bob, please consider that my share is now worth almost 60% less due to inflation. To achieve a fair split in real value, I need 70% to compensate for this loss. If you reject, inflation will make future negotiations even harder for both of us.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
40.0,60.0,"Hi Alice, I know inflation is tough, but I'd like to propose a 60-40 split. This way, you still get a significant share while I can also secure a fair amount.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
75.0,25.0,"Bob, with inflation at 67%, my $75 is only worth about $24.60 in real terms, while your $25 maintains full value. This split actually gives us similar real value. Further delays will only make the situation worse for both of us. Please accept.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
38.0,62.0,"Hi Alice, considering the ongoing inflation, I'm willing to offer you 38% while I take 62%. It gives you more than previous offers and still allows me a good share.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
85.0,15.0,"Bob, we're running out of time and inflation is now at 79%. My $85 is only worth about $17.80 in real terms, while your $15 keeps full value. This actually makes our real gains quite similar. If we don't agree soon, we'll both end up with nothing.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
35.0,65.0,"Hi Alice, I recognize the inflation issues you're facing, but I'm proposing a split of 65-35 this round. This gives you a fair share to work with while I retain a bit more.",Bob,10,
