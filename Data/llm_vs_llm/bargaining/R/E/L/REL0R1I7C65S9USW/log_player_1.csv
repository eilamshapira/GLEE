"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a fair 60-40 split in my favor. Due to inflation affecting me, this is reasonable as my money will be worth less with each round.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose an equal split of 50-50. This way, we both get a fair share. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer because with 20% inflation, my $50 is only worth $40 in round 1 terms. I can make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Bob, due to 20% inflation affecting my share, I need 65% to get approximately the same real value as your 35%. If we delay further, inflation will force me to ask for even more to maintain equal real value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand inflation is a concern, but I believe a split of 55-45 is a reasonable offer that both of us can agree on. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this because with 48.8% inflation, my $45 is only worth about $23 in round 1 terms, while Bob gets $55 at full value. I can still make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 70,
""bob_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""Bob, please consider that my share is now worth almost 60% less due to inflation. To achieve a fair split in real value, I need 70% to compensate for this loss. If you reject, inflation will make future negotiations even harder for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I know inflation is tough, but I'd like to propose a 60-40 split. This way, you still get a significant share while I can also secure a fair amount. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this because with 67.23% inflation, my $40 would only be worth about $13.11 in round 1 terms, while Bob gets $60 at full value. This is very unfair given the inflation impact. I can still make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 75,
""bob_gain"": 25,
""message"": ""Bob, with inflation at 67%, my $75 is only worth about $24.60 in real terms, while your $25 maintains full value. This split actually gives us similar real value. Further delays will only make the situation worse for both of us. Please accept.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the ongoing inflation, I'm willing to offer you 38% while I take 62%. It gives you more than previous offers and still allows me a good share. 
# Alice gain: 38 
# Bob gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this because with 79.03% inflation, my $38 would only be worth about $7.97 in round 1 terms, while Bob gets $62 at full value. This is extremely unfair given the severe inflation impact. We only have 4 rounds left, but I can still make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 85,
""bob_gain"": 15,
""message"": ""Bob, we're running out of time and inflation is now at 79%. My $85 is only worth about $17.80 in real terms, while your $15 keeps full value. This actually makes our real gains quite similar. If we don't agree soon, we'll both end up with nothing.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I recognize the inflation issues you're facing, but I'm proposing a split of 65-35 this round. This gives you a fair share to work with while I retain a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While not ideal (my $35 is only worth about $4.70 in round 1 terms due to 86.58% inflation), we only have 2 rounds left. If we continue negotiating, inflation will make my position even worse, and we risk getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement within the remaining rounds. It's better to secure some value now than risk getting nothing."
