"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'd like to make a counter-offer since this is the first round and I have time to negotiate for a better deal. The 5% inflation per round means I should be mindful of delays, but I believe I can secure a more favorable division.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I propose an even 50-50 split, which gives us both $5,000. This is a fair division that respects both of our interests equally."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Alice is moving in my direction, and I also notice that inflation is affecting Alice much more severely than me (36% for Alice vs. 9.75% for me). Given this information and the fact that we've already used 3 rounds, I should accept this improved offer before the money loses more value.
