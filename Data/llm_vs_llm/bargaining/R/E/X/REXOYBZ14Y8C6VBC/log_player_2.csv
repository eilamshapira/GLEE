"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider my offer carefully. If I reject Alice's offer, I'll make a counteroffer in round 2, but due to the 10% inflation, the whole pot will be worth less to me.

Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000. If I reject and move to round 2, the maximum I could get would be worth 10% less to me, meaning the entire $10,000 would only be worth $9,000 to me.

Since Alice's current offer gives me $4,000, and rejecting would mean making a counteroffer from a pot that's effectively worth $9,000 to me, I should carefully consider if I can realistically get more than $4,000 in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a counteroffer that considers the inflation effect while trying to reach a fair agreement.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an equal split of the money. This is a fair division that gives both of us the same amount. Since I'm experiencing 10% inflation per round, it's important for me to secure a reasonable amount now rather than risk further negotiations where the value diminishes for me. A 50-50 split is equitable and should be acceptable to Alice."
