"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for Round 1, keeping in mind the potential for inflation to affect my gains:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the inflation and the new offer. My $40 is worth 20% less than it was in Round 1.

I had $60 in round 1.

So, in terms of the initial value, my offer in this round is equal to 40 / 0.8 = $50.

Since I had $60 in the first round and now the offer is effectively less than that, and I need to consider future rounds, I will **reject** this offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 3, taking into account the accumulated inflation:

The initial value of $100 is now worth 80% of what it was in round 1 (100% - 20%).
So in this round, $1 is worth 80% of the initial $1.

I will aim for an offer that reflects both my needs and the limited rounds available.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
