"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Here's my thought process as Bob:

*   **Current Value:** Alice is offering me $400,000 in the first round.
*   **Future Value:** If I reject, I'll get to make an offer in Round 2, but the total pot will effectively be worth 5% less to me.
*   **Alternative Considerations:** It is not clear that Alice knows my money will devalue slower than hers.

$400,000 right now is a pretty significant amount. While I might try to squeeze more out of Alice, the risk of inflation (at 5% per round) is quite real.
