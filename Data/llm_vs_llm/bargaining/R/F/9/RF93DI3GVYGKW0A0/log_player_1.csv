"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we settle now. I’d receive $6000 and you’d get $4000. Accepting now lets me avoid the 20% inflation hit on my share. Let’s agree quickly so we both walk away with clear amounts!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, how about we split the money evenly? $5000 each seems fair and ensures we both get a good amount before inflation starts to affect our shares. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
