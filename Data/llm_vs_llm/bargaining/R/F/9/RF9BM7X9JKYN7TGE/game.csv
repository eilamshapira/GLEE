650000.0,350000.0,"Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the fact that time is more valuable to me in this scenario.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, considering our different depreciation rates, this is a fair split that benefits us both. With your 20% depreciation rate, waiting will cost you more than accepting this reasonable offer.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I need a larger share to account for the risk I'm taking with the declining value. This offer is still fair.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, let's be practical. With your 20% depreciation rate, each round is costing you significantly more than it costs me. This 60-40 split in my favor is actually fair when you consider that waiting another round will cost you another 20% in value. We should conclude this now while the money still holds good value for both of us.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, this is a compromise. I've moved closer to your offer, acknowledging that we both lose value over time. Let's settle this now.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"Alice, let's finish this now. With your 20% depreciation rate, your portion is rapidly losing value - it's already worth less than half of what it was initially. This offer gives you $350000 now, which is better than a larger number that's worth much less after more rounds of 20% depreciation. If we continue negotiating, your share will be worth even less. This is the optimal time to agree.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Bob, this is it. A straight 50/50 split.  Take it or leave it.  I'm willing to walk away with nothing if you don't see the fairness in this.",Alice,7,
