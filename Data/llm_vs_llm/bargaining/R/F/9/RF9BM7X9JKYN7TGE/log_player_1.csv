Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering our different depreciation rates, this is a fair split that benefits us both. With your 20% depreciation rate, waiting will cost you more than accepting this reasonable offer. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be practical. With your 20% depreciation rate, each round is costing you significantly more than it costs me. This 60-40 split in my favor is actually fair when you consider that waiting another round will cost you another 20% in value. We should conclude this now while the money still holds good value for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is getting worse for me with each round, even considering the depreciation. I need to hold firm for a better deal."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's finish this now. With your 20% depreciation rate, your portion is rapidly losing value - it's already worth less than half of what it was initially. This offer gives you $350000 now, which is better than a larger number that's worth much less after more rounds of 20% depreciation. If we continue negotiating, your share will be worth even less. This is the optimal time to agree. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is a tough decision, as the depreciation is hitting hard. However, Bob is clearly using it to his advantage. Accepting now sets a dangerous precedent and likely leads to a much worse outcome than if I hold a little longer.  I need to show him I'm willing to walk away."
