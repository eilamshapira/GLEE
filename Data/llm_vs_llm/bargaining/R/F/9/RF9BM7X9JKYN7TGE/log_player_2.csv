"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the fact that time is more valuable to me in this scenario. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice offers me $350,000 (35%) while keeping $650,000 (65%)
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 5% less to me next round
3. Alice faces a steeper 20% depreciation per round
4. Alice's higher depreciation rate gives me leverage in negotiations
5. Even though this is a decent offer, I can likely get better terms given Alice's worse position

Since Alice loses value much faster than I do (20% vs 5%), I should reject this offer and make a counter-proposal. The significant difference in depreciation rates works in my favor.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a strategic counter-offer:

1. Alice loses 20% value per round while I only lose 5%
2. This means she has more pressure to agree soon
3. However, I shouldn't be too aggressive as we still need her agreement
4. A more balanced split would be fair, slightly in my favor

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, considering our different depreciation rates, this is a fair split that benefits us both. With your 20% depreciation rate, waiting will cost you more than accepting this reasonable offer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but I need a larger share to account for the risk I'm taking with the declining value. This offer is still fair. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is now offering me $400,000 (40%), up from her initial $350,000
2. The money is now worth 9.75% less to me, so $400,000 is effectively worth $361,000
3. For Alice, her $600,000 is worth only 64% of original value, so effectively $384,000
4. The depreciation gap continues to widen in my favor
5. Alice is showing willingness to negotiate by increasing my share
6. However, given the strong depreciation pressure on Alice's side, I can still get a better deal

Since Alice is facing much steeper value loss (20% vs 5% per round), and we've seen she's willing to improve offers, I should push for a better split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a strategic offer:

1. Alice's money is now worth 48.8% less than round 1 (after 3 rounds at 20% depreciation)
2. My money is worth 14.26% less (after 3 rounds at 5% depreciation)
3. Alice has shown flexibility by increasing my share
4. I should push for a better split but remain reasonable to get agreement

{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be practical. With your 20% depreciation rate, each round is costing you significantly more than it costs me. This 60-40 split in my favor is actually fair when you consider that waiting another round will cost you another 20% in value. We should conclude this now while the money still holds good value for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a compromise. I've moved closer to your offer, acknowledging that we both lose value over time. Let's settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this latest offer:

1. Alice is now offering me $450,000 (45%), up from her previous $400,000
2. Due to 18.55% depreciation, my $450,000 is effectively worth $366,525
3. Alice's $550,000 is worth only about $225,280 to her (59.04% depreciation)
4. She's clearly feeling the pressure of her higher depreciation rate
5. However, her depreciation rate continues to compound much faster than mine
6. She's moved significantly from her initial position (from 35% to 45% for me)
7. But the gap in our depreciation rates gives me even more leverage for the next round

Given that Alice's money is losing value so much faster than mine, and she's shown consistent willingness to improve offers, I should push for one more round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a strategic final offer:

1. Alice's value loss is now severe (67.23% after 5 rounds)
2. My value loss is much lower (22.62% after 5 rounds)
3. She's shown consistent willingness to compromise
4. We're halfway through our rounds, and the risk of getting nothing is increasing
5. I should make an offer that's good enough for her to accept while leveraging my stronger position

{""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's finish this now. With your 20% depreciation rate, your portion is rapidly losing value - it's already worth less than half of what it was initially. This offer gives you $350,000 now, which is better than a larger number that's worth much less after more rounds of 20% depreciation. If we continue negotiating, your share will be worth even less. This is the optimal time to agree.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is it. A straight 50/50 split.  Take it or leave it.  I'm willing to walk away with nothing if you don't see the fairness in this. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me carefully analyze this crucial moment:

1. Alice is offering a 50/50 split and taking a hard stance
2. My $500,000 would be worth $367,550 after 26.49% depreciation
3. Alice's $500,000 is only worth $131,050 to her after 73.79% depreciation
4. She's threatening to walk away, which would leave us both with nothing
5. We're in round 7 of 12, so the risk of getting nothing is becoming real
6. Her ""take it or leave it"" stance suggests she might be willing to let this fail
7. The difference in our depreciation rates is still in my favor, but the risk is increasing

While I could theoretically push for more given the depreciation rates, Alice's firm stance and willingness to walk away make this a risky choice. A guaranteed $500,000 (worth $367,550 to me) is better than risking getting nothing. The 50/50 split also has a certain fairness that makes it a reasonable stopping point.
