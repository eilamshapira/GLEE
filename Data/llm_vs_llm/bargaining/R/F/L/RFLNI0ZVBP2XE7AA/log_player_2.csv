"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Alice is offering a 50-50 split ($500,000 each)
2. If I reject, we go to next round where I can make an offer
3. However, due to 20% inflation per round for me:
   * Next round my $500,000 would only be worth $400,000 in current value
   * Any future negotiations would be at a disadvantage for me

Given that:
- This is a fair split
- Inflation will hurt my position in future rounds
- There's no guarantee Alice would accept a better offer from me
- The risk of getting nothing after 12 rounds is real
