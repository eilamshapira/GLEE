"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is offering me 200,000$ out of the 1,000,000$, which is 20% of the total amount. Given that each round reduces the value by 20% for me (but not for Alice), I should weigh the current offer against potential future gains.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2, the total value to me would be worth 20% less, meaning the 1,000,000$ would effectively be worth 800,000$ to me. But I could potentially negotiate a larger percentage.

Since this is just the first round and Alice's initial offer gives me only 20% of the pot, I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer while accounting for the inflation penalty I face.

Since we're now in round 2, the money is already worth 20% less to me. With each round, my negotiating position weakens while Alice's remains constant. I should propose a fair division that Alice would find reasonable enough to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50/50 split which is fair to both of us. This acknowledges that we both deserve an equal share of the money, and it gives Alice a substantial increase from what she offered me initially."
