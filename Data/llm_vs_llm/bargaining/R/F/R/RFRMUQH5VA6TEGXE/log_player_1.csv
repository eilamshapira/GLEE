"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. My money is worth less due to inflation.

Considering the offer:

*   **My gain:** $40
*   **Inflation on my money:** 10% of $40 is $4. My money is worth $40 - $4 = $36 in real terms.

I'll answer:

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 3, taking into account that my money is worth even less now:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
