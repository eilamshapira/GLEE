Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Okay Alice, let's be fair.  A 50/50 split is the most straightforward way to do this.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a fair split, Bob, but time is literally money!  Let's compromise, a bit closer to my original offer? 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is barely better than her last one, even considering the inflation.  I'm willing to push this a bit further to see if she'll move closer to a 50/50 split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5100, ""alice_gain"": 4900, ""message"": ""Time is money Alice, you're right. But a fair split is key. This offer is a slight advantage for me, reflecting the time pressure.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. This is a very slight advantage for me, acknowledging the time factor. Let's close this deal! 
# Bob gain: 4950 
# Alice gain: 5050 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is as close to a 50/50 split as I think I'm going to get, especially with the inflation working against me. It's better to take a reasonable offer now than risk getting even less later."
