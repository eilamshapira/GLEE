"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take a bit more to account for the inflation risk. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000
2. If I reject, the next round will have 5% inflation for me
3. After inflation, $400,000 in the next round would be worth $380,000 to me
4. I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but Alice might reject it
5. We have limited rounds (12), so we need to reach agreement eventually
6. This is a reasonable first offer - I get 40% which isn't terrible

While I could try to negotiate for more, the risk of losing value through inflation and potential further negotiations makes this offer acceptable. It's better to secure a good amount now than risk getting less later.
