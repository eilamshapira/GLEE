"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think this through:

1. Current offer: $400,000 for me, $600,000 for Alice
2. If I reject, we go to next round where:
   * I can make an offer
   * But my money will be worth 20% less
   * $400,000 now > ($500,000 * 0.8 = $400,000) next round

The important factor here is that inflation affects only my share. Even if I make a better offer next round, the 20% reduction means I likely won't do better than the current $400,000 offer.

If I reject, any future gains will be reduced by 20%, making it difficult to achieve a better outcome than the current $400,000 offer.
