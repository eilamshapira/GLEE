"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the money 60-40 in my favor. It's a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""My turn! I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. It's more reasonable, don't you think?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the money evenly at 50-50. Let's keep it simple and fair! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my actual gain would be 50 * 0.81 = 40.5 (since it's worth 19% less). 
However, since Alice's gain is worth 36% less, this might be a relatively good deal for me.
