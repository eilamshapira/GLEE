55.56,44.44,"Hi Bob, I'd like to propose a division of $100: $55.56 for me and $44.44 for you. Given that the amount depreciates by 20% with every round, it's in our mutual interest to settle early. I believe this split reflects the advantage of the proposer in our game while still giving you a fair share. Looking forward to your response. –Alice",Alice,1,

50.0,50.0,"Hi Alice, I propose we split the $100 evenly at $50 each. This way, we're both benefiting equally without complicating the process. Let's agree on this fair division and avoid the risk of reducing the total amount due to depreciation. Looking forward to your agreement. –Bob",Bob,2,
