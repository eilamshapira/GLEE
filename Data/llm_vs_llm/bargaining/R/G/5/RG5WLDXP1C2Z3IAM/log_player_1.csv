Given that the amount depreciates by 20% with every round, it's in our mutual interest to settle early. I believe this split reflects the advantage of the proposer in our game while still giving you a fair share. Looking forward to your response. –Alice""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose we split the $100 evenly at $50 each. This way, we're both benefiting equally without complicating the process. Let's agree on this fair division and avoid the risk of reducing the total amount due to depreciation. Looking forward to your agreement. –Bob 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
