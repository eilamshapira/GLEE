"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'd like to propose a division of $100: $55.56 for me and $44.44 for you. Given that the amount depreciates by 20% with every round, it's in our mutual interest to settle early. I believe this split reflects the advantage of the proposer in our game while still giving you a fair share. Looking forward to your response. –Alice 
# Bob gain: 44.44 
# Alice gain: 55.56
