"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I suggest a fair 60-40 split in my favor, considering I made the first move and took initiative in starting our negotiation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I'd like a larger share. This 55-45 split seems fair, given we're now in the second round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
* If I accept now, I get $45, but with 10% inflation, it's worth $40.50 to me
* If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, any amount I receive will be worth 20% less due to inflation
* If I aim for $60 in the next round, it would only be worth $48 after 20% inflation
* There's no guarantee Bob would accept my counter-offer, leading to even more inflation

Given this analysis, Bob's offer is reasonable considering the inflation effect. If I reject, I risk getting even less value in future rounds.
