Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: How about I get 5500 and you get 4500? This way, we both get a fair share, and you still get a good amount even with the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
