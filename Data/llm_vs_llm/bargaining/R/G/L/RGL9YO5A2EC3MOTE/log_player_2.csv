"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me 400,000$ (40%) while keeping 600,000$ (60%)
2. If I reject, I can make my own proposal next round
3. There's no inflation penalty for me, so I don't lose value by waiting
4. Since it's not a strictly fair 50-50 split, and I don't lose anything by waiting, I can try to negotiate for a better deal

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split, but slightly in my favor since I'm making the offer:

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I propose a more balanced split that's still generous to both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer, slightly more to me 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice's offer has improved slightly from her first offer (from 400,000$ to 420,000$ for me)
2. I know that Alice's money is worth 36% less due to inflation
3. For Alice, her 580,000$ is now effectively worth only 371,200$ (580,000 * 0.64)
4. My 420,000$ maintains its full value since I'm not affected by inflation
5. Given that Alice is now actually getting less value due to inflation, and I'm getting more than the first offer, this is becoming a more favorable deal for me
