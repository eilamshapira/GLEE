"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, how about I take slightly more since I'm the one making the offer? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $45 out of $100
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, the total amount will decrease to $95 in the next round
4. My $45 share now is better than getting even $50 of the reduced $95 pot (which would be $47.50)
5. It's a reasonable first offer, showing willingness to be relatively fair
