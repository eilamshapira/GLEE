"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $400,000 while she gets $600,000 of the $1,000,000 total. 

If I reject this offer, I'll make a counter-proposal in the next round, but due to inflation, the money will be worth 10% less to me. This means the entire $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $900,000 to me in the next round.

If I could secure a larger percentage in the next round, it might be worth rejecting. However, there's no guarantee Alice would accept my counter-offer, and further rounds would reduce the value even more due to inflation.

Given that $400,000 is a substantial amount, and the risk of losing value with inflation:
