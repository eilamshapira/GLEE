"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer gives me $450,000 and her $550,000. Let me think about this.

I should consider that:
1) If I reject, I can make my own offer next round
2) Alice faces a 10% inflation penalty each round, while I face no inflation
3) This means Alice has more pressure to reach an agreement sooner

Since I don't face any inflation penalty and Alice's money loses 10% value each round, I have leverage to negotiate a better deal. If I reject now, I can propose a more favorable split next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice faces 10% inflation per round and I don't, I'll propose a more favorable split for me, but still reasonable enough that she might accept rather than lose more value.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because it gives me a majority share while still offering Alice a substantial amount. If she rejects, her portion will be worth less in the next round due to inflation, so she has incentive to accept now."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has improved her offer, giving me $480,000 and taking $520,000 for herself. Let me analyze this situation:

1) Alice's portion is now worth 19% less to her due to inflation (so her $520,000 is effectively worth about $421,200 in round 1 terms for her)
2) My money doesn't lose value due to inflation
3) If I reject, we go to round 4, where I can make a new offer
4) In round 4, Alice will face even more inflation (27.1%)

Since I have a significant advantage with no inflation penalty, and Alice's position weakens each round, I can likely get a better deal by rejecting.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice's money is now worth 27.1% less to her in the next round, and she rejected my previous offer of 550,000/450,000, I'll propose a split that gives me a bit more while still being potentially acceptable to Alice given her worsening position due to inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

This offer gives me 60% of the money, which is reasonable considering that Alice faces significant inflation penalties while I don't. If she rejects this offer, her position will only worsen as inflation increases, giving her incentive to accept now rather than risk further devaluation of her share."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has improved her offer to a 50/50 split, giving me $500,000 and taking $500,000 for herself. Let me analyze this:

1) Alice's portion is now worth 34.39% less to her due to inflation (so her $500,000 is effectively worth about $328,050 in round 1 terms for her)
2) My money doesn't lose value due to inflation
3) If I reject, we go to round 6, where I can make a new offer
4) In round 6, Alice will face even more inflation (approximately 41%)

Despite being an even split, I have a significant advantage in the negotiation because of the inflation asymmetry. If I reject, I can likely get an even better deal in the next round as Alice's position continues to weaken.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that Alice has now offered a 50/50 split but is facing approximately 41% inflation on her share in this round, I'll increase my request. Since she's rejected my previous offer of a 60/40 split, I'll go for a somewhat higher amount but not so high that she would certainly reject it.

{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000}

This offer gives me 65% of the money while Alice gets 35%. Considering that her portion is significantly devalued by inflation (while mine isn't affected), this still provides her with reasonable value compared to waiting for future rounds where her share would be worth even less. With nearly half of our rounds gone and her inflation penalty increasing, accepting now would be rational."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 520000 
# Alice gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has improved her offer to $520,000 for me and $480,000 for herself. Let me analyze this:

1) Alice's portion is now worth 46.86% less to her due to inflation (so her $480,000 is effectively worth only about $254,928 in round 1 terms for her)
2) My money doesn't lose value due to inflation
3) If I reject, we go to round 8, where I can make a new offer
4) In round 8, Alice will face approximately 52% inflation

Alice's position continues to weaken significantly with each round. Her current offer gives me 52% of the money, but given the severe inflation penalty she faces and the fact that we've already gone through 7 rounds (with only 5 remaining), I believe I can still negotiate a better deal for myself.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that Alice is now facing approximately 52% inflation on her share and has rejected my previous offer of 65/35, I'll adjust my proposal to be more aggressive but still potentially acceptable to her given her deteriorating position.

{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}

This offer gives me 70% of the money while Alice gets 30%. With her facing significant inflation (her $300,000 would be worth only about $144,000 in round 1 terms to her), and with only 4 rounds remaining after this one, the pressure for her to accept increases substantially. If she rejects, her position will only continue to worsen, making this a rational choice for her despite the uneven split."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 540000 
# Alice gain: 460000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has improved her offer to $540,000 for me and $460,000 for herself. Let me analyze this:

1) Alice's portion is now worth 56.95% less to her due to inflation (so her $460,000 is effectively worth only about $198,030 in round 1 terms for her)
2) My money doesn't lose value due to inflation
3) If I reject, we go to round 10, where I can make a new offer
4) In round 10, Alice will face approximately 61% inflation
5) We now have only 3 rounds remaining after this one

Alice's position continues to weaken dramatically. Her current offer gives me 54% of the money, but given the severe inflation penalty she faces and the fact that we're approaching the end of the game, I believe I can still negotiate a much better deal for myself.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With only three rounds remaining (including this one) and Alice facing approximately 61% inflation on her share in this round, I'll make a stronger offer that reflects my significant negotiating advantage while still giving Alice reason to accept rather than risk getting nothing.

{""bob_gain"": 750000, ""alice_gain"": 250000}

This offer gives me 75% of the money while Alice gets 25%. Given that her portion is severely devalued by inflation (worth less than 40% of its original value to her), and with only two more rounds possible after this one, accepting this offer is becoming increasingly rational for her. The alternative is risking further devaluation or potentially getting nothing if we can't reach an agreement by round 12. If she rejects this offer, I can propose an even more aggressive split in round 12."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 65.13% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 560000 
# Alice gain: 440000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has improved her offer to $560,000 for me and $440,000 for herself. Let me analyze this:

1) Alice's portion is now worth 65.13% less to her due to inflation (so her $440,000 is effectively worth only about $153,428 in round 1 terms for her)
2) My money doesn't lose value due to inflation
3) If I reject, we go to the final round (round 12), where I make one last offer
4) In round 12, Alice will face approximately 69% inflation
5) This is the second-to-last round of the game

Alice's position is extremely weak now. Her current offer gives me 56% of the money, but with only one round remaining after this and her facing severe inflation, I have significant leverage. If we don't reach an agreement in the final round, we both get nothing, but I believe I can propose a much more favorable split for myself in the final round that she would still accept rather than get nothing.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 11.
Round 12
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","This is the final round, and we must reach an agreement or we both get nothing. Alice is now facing approximately 69% inflation on her share, making her position extremely weak.

Given that this is the last round and Alice has gradually improved her offers (now up to giving me $560,000), I need to balance maximizing my gain while ensuring she accepts rather than walking away with nothing.

{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000}

This offer gives me 80% of the money while Alice gets 20%. Even with her severe inflation penalty (her $200,000 is worth roughly $62,000 in round 1 terms to her), getting something is better than nothing for Alice. She has consistently shown willingness to accept an agreement, and this offer, while heavily in my favor, still provides her with value that she would completely lose if she rejects. This is a calculated risk that maximizes my gain while still giving her sufficient incentive to accept rather than letting both of us get nothing."
