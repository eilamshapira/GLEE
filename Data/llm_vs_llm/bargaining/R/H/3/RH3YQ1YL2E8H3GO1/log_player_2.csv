"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's settle early to maximize value. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me 450,000$ vs 550,000$ for herself
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to inflation:
   - For me, money will be worth 5% less next round
   - For Alice, money will be worth 20% less next round
4. This gives me leverage, as she's more affected by delays
5. 450,000$ is a decent offer, but I can probably get more given my stronger position

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that Alice faces much steeper inflation (20% vs my 5%), I'll propose a split more in my favor, but not too aggressive to ensure acceptance:

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Since you face 20% inflation per round and I only face 5%, this split is fair - waiting would cost you more than accepting this offer.""}"
