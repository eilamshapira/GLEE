Alice's offer:

# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the fair offer, but considering the inflation affecting me, I need a bit more to make it fair for both of us. How about I get 5500 and you get 4500?"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, considering the inflation on my side, I think this split would be more fair. I still want to be reasonable, so I'm not asking for too much more.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, since you're feeling the pinch of inflation, I'm willing to adjust my offer. This split is closer to your last proposal but still fair to both of us. Let's end this on a good note. 
# Bob gain: 5250 
# Alice gain: 4750 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
