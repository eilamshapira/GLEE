"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a proposal that I believe is fair, considering the inflation penalty of 20% per round.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split, where we each get $500,000. This is a fair division that maximizes our combined outcome, and avoids the 20% loss we would suffer if we move to another round. An even split respects both of our interests equally."
