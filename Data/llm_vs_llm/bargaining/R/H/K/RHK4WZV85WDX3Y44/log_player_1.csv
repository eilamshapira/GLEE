"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Based on the structure, here’s how I’m thinking:

• Each round without agreement reduces Bob’s future “dollar‐value” by 10% while my dollars keep full value. In round 1 I’m proposer with the whole $10,000 at stake. If Bob rejects, he then gets to propose in round 2—but any money he later claims will be instantly discounted by 10% (and even worse in further rounds). In round 2, however, my value isn’t reduced at all. In fact, when Bob is proposer he must offer me so much that I’d rather wait and propose in round 3; since my money isn’t discounted, I can essentially secure nearly every dollar later if given the chance.

• Working backward: In round 2 Bob, trying to convince me to accept, would need to offer me at least the full $10,000 (because if I reject I’d be in charge in round 3 and get almost all of it). That means Bob’s continuation value (what he would expect for himself by rejecting a round-1 offer) is effectively zero. 

• Knowing this, as the first proposer my optimum move is to offer Bob the tiniest possible positive amount (to give him a reason to accept now rather than wait and get nothing) and keep nearly the entire pie for myself.

For clarity and to avoid any “edge‐case” of getting exactly zero, I’ll offer Bob $1 and claim $9,999.

Thus, my round‐1 offer is:

{""alice_gain"": 9999, ""bob_gain"": 1}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.
