Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I propose we split the money equally. A fair 50-50 split gives us each $5,000. This is the most equitable solution and respects both of our interests."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I notice we're having trouble reaching an agreement. Due to the inflation penalty that only affects me, I need to propose a slightly higher amount for myself to account for this disadvantage. This split of $5,500 for me and $4,500 for you is still quite fair considering the 10% inflation penalty per round that only I face. If we continue another round, we both risk losing value."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500}

I need to account for the significant inflation penalty that only affects me. At this point, I've lost over 34% of my purchasing power due to inflation. If we don't reach an agreement soon, my share will continue to decrease in value while yours remains the same. This offer of $6,500 for me and $3,500 for you is fair considering these circumstances. Please consider accepting so we can both benefit from this negotiation."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 8000, ""alice_gain"": 2000}

I see we're at an impasse. At this point, I've lost nearly 47% of my purchasing power due to inflation, while you face no such penalty. This is an extremely asymmetric situation. I propose $8,000 for me and $2,000 for you, which would give me approximately $4,250 in effective value after accounting for inflation. This is now less than half of the original amount, while you still get $2,000 at full value. If we continue further, I'll lose even more to inflation. This is a fair compromise given the circumstances."

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 10
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 9500, ""alice_gain"": 500}

I can see that we're in a very difficult situation. At this point, I've lost almost 57% of my purchasing power due to inflation, meaning any amount I receive is worth less than half of its nominal value. My offer of $9,500 for me and $500 for you would give me about $4,092 in effective value after accounting for inflation, which is less than half of the original pot. 

This may seem unbalanced at first glance, but it's actually quite fair when considering the severe inflation penalty I face. If we continue to another round, I'll lose even more purchasing power. This is my final attempt at a reasonable compromise given these extremely asymmetric circumstances."
