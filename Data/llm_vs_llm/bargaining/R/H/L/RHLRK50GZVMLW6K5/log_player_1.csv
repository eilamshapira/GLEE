"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make my first offer to Bob to divide the $1,000,000.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 55/45 split that slightly favors me since I face a 5% inflation penalty each round. This is fair because if we delay, we both lose value. Let's make a deal now so we both walk away with a good amount.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your point about inflation, but I believe a 50/50 split is the fairest option.  Let's settle this now and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
