"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 55/45 split that slightly favors me since I face a 5% inflation penalty each round. This is fair because if we delay, we both lose value. Let's make a deal now so we both walk away with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
