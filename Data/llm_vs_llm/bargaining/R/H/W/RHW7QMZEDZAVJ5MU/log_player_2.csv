"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a counter-offer in the next round. Even with 10% inflation coming up, I can propose a more balanced split that would be better than just $2000."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I propose a fair 50-50 split. This is much more equitable than the previous offer, and even with the 10% inflation effect on my share, I would receive $4,500 which is significantly better than the $2,000 offered in round 1."
