"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know your earlier proposal gave you $55, but every delay cuts into what I can really count on due to inflation. To avoid further losses for both of us, I propose we settle nowâ€”with me receiving $46 and you $54. I believe this small adjustment secures an immediate deal and prevents any further unnecessary erosion in value. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 54 
# Bob gain: 46 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
