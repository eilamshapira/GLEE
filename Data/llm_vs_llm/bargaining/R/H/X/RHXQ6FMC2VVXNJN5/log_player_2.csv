Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 46, ""alice_gain"": 54, ""message"": ""Alice, I know your earlier proposal gave you $55, but every delay cuts into what I can really count on due to inflation. To avoid further losses for both of us, I propose we settle nowâ€”with me receiving $46 and you $54. I believe this small adjustment secures an immediate deal and prevents any further unnecessary erosion in value. What do you say?""}"
