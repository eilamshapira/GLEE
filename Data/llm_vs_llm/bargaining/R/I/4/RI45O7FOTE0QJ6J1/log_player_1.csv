"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I suggest a fair split where I get 60% and you get 40%. This way we both benefit without dragging this out and losing money to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split it 55-45 in my favor. Given the last round, I think this is a fair compromise considering potential inflation impacts. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think this through:
* If I accept now, I get $45, but it's worth 10% less due to inflation, so effectively $40.5
* If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
  * Any amount I get will be worth 20% less due to inflation
  * Bob might reject again, leading to even more value loss
  * Even if I got $60 in the next round, it would be worth $48 after 20% inflation

Given this, Bob's offer is not great but waiting would likely make things worse due to increasing inflation penalties. Better to secure $40.5 now than risk getting less in real value later.
