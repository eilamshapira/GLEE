"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering me $4,000 while taking $6,000 for herself. I should consider that with each passing round, the money loses 10% of its value for Alice, while it maintains its value for me. This gives me some negotiating leverage.

If I reject now, I can make a counter-offer in round 2. Since I don't face any inflation penalty, I think I can negotiate for a better split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that takes into account our different inflation rates. Since Alice faces 10% inflation per round while I face none, I'll propose a more favorable split for me while still making it reasonable enough for her to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

I think this is fair considering Alice's 10% inflation penalty per round. If she rejects and we go to round 3, her $4000 would be worth only $3600 to her, so accepting now would be in her best interest."
