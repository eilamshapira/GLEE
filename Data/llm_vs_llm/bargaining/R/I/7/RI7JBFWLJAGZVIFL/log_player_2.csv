"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

* The offer is a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
* However, I have a slight advantage in future rounds due to lower inflation penalty (5% vs 10%)
* If I reject, I can make a proposal next round that accounts for the differential inflation
* My $50 would be worth $47.50 next round, while Alice's $50 would be worth $45
* This suggests I could potentially get a better deal by rejecting and proposing something like 55-45 next round

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let me make a strategic offer...

Since we've moved to round 2:
- My money will be worth 95% of original value
- Alice's money will be worth 90% of original value
- Alice will want to avoid going to round 3 where her money would be worth even less

I'll propose a split that accounts for this inflation difference while still being attractive enough for Alice to accept:

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

This split is fair because:
1. It accounts for the differential inflation rates
2. If Alice rejects, her next round money will be worth even less
3. It's not so greedy that it would provoke rejection on principle"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. If I accept:
   * I get $52, but it's worth 9.75% less = $46.93 effective value
   * Alice gets $48, worth 19% less = $38.88 effective value

2. If I reject and we go to round 4:
   * My money will be worth 14.75% less (another 5%)
   * Alice's money will be worth 29% less (another 10%)
   * Any future gains will be significantly devalued for both of us

This is actually a decent offer considering:
- It gives me the majority share
- The inflation is starting to significantly impact both of us
- Further negotiations will lead to more value loss
- The effective split (46.93 vs 38.88) is actually quite favorable to me
