"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100000,
  ""bob_gain"": 900000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering inflation, my money is worth less now. I need to factor that into my decision.

My effective gain from Bob's offer, after factoring in the 20% inflation from the first round, is less valuable than it appears.

Given the offer:

*   Alice gets $500,000.
*   Bob gets $500,000.

Since my money is worth less now, this is still a good offer for me in terms of my current position, as it is equal to Bob's.

Therefore:

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
