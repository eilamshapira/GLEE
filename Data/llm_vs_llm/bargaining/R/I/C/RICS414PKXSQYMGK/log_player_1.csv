"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for round 1, keeping in mind the inflation will affect future rounds more. I'll aim for a slightly more favorable split for myself, but not so much that Bob rejects it outright.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this.

*   **My perspective:** Accepting gives me $50 now, which is worth 5% less than $1 from round 1. So it's worth $50 * 0.95 = $47.50 in round 1 money.

*   **Rejecting:** If I reject, I get to make the offer in round 3. However, the money will be worth 10% less for me (0.90) and 40% less for Bob (0.60) compared to round 1. I'd need to secure a higher percentage of the money in round 3 to make up for the increased inflation for me.

Bob offered a split of 50/50, so I'll accept the offer.
