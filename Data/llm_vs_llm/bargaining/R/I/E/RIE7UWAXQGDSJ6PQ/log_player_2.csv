"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The offer gives me $4,000 out of $10,000, which is 40% of the total amount. If I reject and move to the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation, meaning the entire $10,000 would effectively be worth only $8,000 to me in the next round. 

If I make a counter-offer in the next round, even if I propose taking the entire $10,000 for myself (which Alice would likely reject), my maximum potential gain would be $8,000 due to the inflation effect.

Since $4,000 now is better than potentially getting a larger nominal amount that's worth less in the future, and there's no guarantee Alice would accept a better offer from me, I'll accept this offer.
