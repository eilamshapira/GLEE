40.0,60.0,"Alice, since you face 20% inflation per round while I don't, you have more incentive to reach a deal sooner. If you reject this offer, in the next round any money you receive will be worth 20% less to you. This 60-40 split is actually fair when accounting for our different inflation rates, as waiting another round would significantly reduce your purchasing power.",Bob,2,
