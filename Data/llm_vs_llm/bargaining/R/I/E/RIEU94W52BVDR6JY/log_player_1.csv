"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, since you face 20% inflation per round while I don't, you have more incentive to reach a deal sooner. If you reject this offer, in the next round any money you receive will be worth 20% less to you. This 60-40 split is actually fair when accounting for our different inflation rates, as waiting another round would significantly reduce your purchasing power. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
