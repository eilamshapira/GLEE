"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's take inflation into account. I'm offering you $40, and I'll take $60. This is fair given the decreasing value for me in later rounds. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer gives me $40 and her $60. I need to consider whether this is fair given our different inflation rates.

For me, there's no inflation (0%), so $40 now is worth exactly $40.

For Alice, there's 20% inflation per round. So if we go to the next round, any money she gets would be worth 20% less to her. This means her $60 now is worth more to her than waiting.

If I reject and make a counter-offer, Alice might reject it, leading to further rounds and her money losing more value. However, the split doesn't seem equitable given that I have more leverage due to inflation affecting only her side.

I should reject this offer and propose a more favorable split for myself in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced division considering our different inflation positions.

{""bob_gain"": 60, 
""alice_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Alice, since you face 20% inflation per round while I don't, you have more incentive to reach a deal sooner. If you reject this offer, in the next round any money you receive will be worth 20% less to you. This 60-40 split is actually fair when accounting for our different inflation rates, as waiting another round would significantly reduce your purchasing power.""}"
