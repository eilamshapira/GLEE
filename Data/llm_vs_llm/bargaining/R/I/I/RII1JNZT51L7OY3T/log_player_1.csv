"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm not happy with this offer, but I'm willing to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000}

I'm aiming for a slightly better split than my initial offer, knowing that the clock (and inflation) is working against me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is worse than his previous offer and getting very close to unacceptable. I need to signal I'm serious about getting a fair deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 510000, ""bob_gain"": 490000}

I'm holding firm on a 50/50 split being the ultimate goal, but I'm making a small concession to incentivize Bob to settle sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 430000 
# Bob gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is unacceptable. Bob seems to be trying to take advantage of the inflation working against me. I need to hold firm and be willing to walk away."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

It's time to lay my cards on the table. A 50/50 split is the only fair deal, and with the increasing inflation, it's getting riskier to keep playing."
