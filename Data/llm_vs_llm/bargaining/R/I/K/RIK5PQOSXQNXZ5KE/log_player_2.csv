"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","While I'd like to get more than $20, I need to consider the 20% inflation penalty per round. If I reject, in the next round the total value to me will only be $80. Let me evaluate if I should negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a more balanced split while considering that we both face inflation penalties with each round.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

Given the 20% inflation penalty per round, I think a fair 50-50 split would be reasonable. This way we both get an equal share, and neither of us loses more value to inflation by prolonging the negotiation."
