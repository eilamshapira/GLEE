"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer gives me $400,000 while she would get $600,000 out of the $1,000,000. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total money will be worth 10% less to me, meaning the entire pot would be worth $900,000 from my perspective. This gives me room to negotiate for a better deal.

Given that Alice faces a 20% depreciation if we go to the next round (the money would be worth only $800,000 to her), I have some leverage to get a better offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more equitable split that takes into account our different inflation rates.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split of the money. This is fair and gives us both equal amounts. Since Alice faces a higher inflation rate (20% vs my 10%), accepting this even split now is actually in her interest compared to continuing to another round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this new offer:

Alice is now offering me $450,000, which is better than her initial offer of $400,000. However, due to inflation, this $450,000 is worth 19% less to me than money in round 1, making it equivalent to about $364,500 in round 1 value.

If I reject and we go to round 4, any money I receive will be worth 19% + 10% = 29% less than round 1 value.

Alice's offer of $550,000 to herself is worth only 64% of round 1 value to her (since it's 36% less), making it equivalent to about $352,000 in round 1 value for her.

If we continue to round 4, the inflation penalty affects her more severely than me. However, the current offer is better than her first offer, and the continued inflation will harm both of us.
