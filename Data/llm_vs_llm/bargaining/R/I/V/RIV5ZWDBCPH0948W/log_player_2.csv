Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's go for an even split this time, $50 each. Given the inflation penalty you face, this seems fair. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
