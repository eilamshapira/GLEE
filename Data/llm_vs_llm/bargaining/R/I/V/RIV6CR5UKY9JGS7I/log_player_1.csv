"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Hey Bob, I think $200,000 is a fair offer for you to accept, so we can both win and finish the game early.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think a 50-50 split is the fairest approach for both of us. This way we both walk away with an equal share of $500000 each, which is a substantial amount. Since there's no inflation penalty for me to continue negotiating, I'm proposing this balanced split. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
