"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I think $200000 is a fair offer for you to accept, so we can both win and finish the game early. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Alice's offer of $200,000 to me while she takes $800,000. Since there's no inflation for me mentioned (0% less each round), I don't lose value by continuing to the next round where I can make a counter-offer. This initial split gives Alice 80% of the money, which seems quite uneven.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I think a 50-50 split is the fairest approach for both of us. This way we both walk away with an equal share of $500,000 each, which is a substantial amount. Since there's no inflation penalty for me to continue negotiating, I'm proposing this balanced split.""}"
