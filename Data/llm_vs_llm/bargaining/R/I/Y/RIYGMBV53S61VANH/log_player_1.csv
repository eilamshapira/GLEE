"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I'm playing as Alice, and the money is worth less to me with each passing round, but not to Bob. I need to propose a split in JSON format. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

My reasoning:

*   I'm starting aggressively but not ridiculously so. I'm prioritizing getting a larger share upfront while the money is still worth its full value to me.
*   I'm offering Bob $400,000. While not a majority, it's still a significant amount and should be enough to entice him to accept, especially in the first round. If he rejects now, he risks me offering him less later, knowing that the money decreases in value for me.

I'm ready for Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob rejected my offer and is now proposing a 50/50 split.

Let's analyze:

*   **Alice's Perspective:** $500,000 in this round is worth 90% of $500,000 from Round 1 due to the inflation penalty. That means it's equivalent to $450,000 from round 1.
*   **Bob's Perspective:** Bob's $500,000 is worth the same as it was in Round 1.

Comparing to my Round 1 offer of $600,000:

*   If I accept, I get the equivalent of $450,000 from Round 1.
*   If I reject, I risk further erosion of value in future rounds and the possibility of getting nothing after 12 rounds.

While I'd prefer more, $450,000 (in Round 1 terms) is still a decent amount. Considering the risk of future rounds, I'll accept.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
