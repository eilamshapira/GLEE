"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Split it evenly, no need to wait""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly, minimizing the effect of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I need a bit more to account for inflation. Let's settle this quickly, as waiting will reduce the value for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I calculate the value of my gain as follows:
$450,000 * 0.95 = $427,500 (5% less due to inflation)

Bob's offer gives me $427,500, which is less than the $475,000 I would have gotten if I had accepted a 50-50 split in the first round (considering the 5% inflation).

However, if I reject this offer, the money will be worth even less in the next round. So, I'll accept Bob's offer to minimize further losses.
