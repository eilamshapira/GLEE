"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a fair offer to Bob considering the inflation factor that affects him.

{""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 55/45 split. This is fair because if we go to the next round, the money will be worth 10% less to you due to inflation, so you'd need to offer me less than 55 to be better off. Let's conclude this efficiently.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60, you get 40.  It's better than your last offer.  If we go to the next round, the money will be worth less to me, so let's settle this now. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Bob, due to the 10% inflation that affects you each round, your $60 from last round would only be worth $54 to you now. My offer of $40 to you is actually worth $36 in your valuation. I'm now offering you $40, which is worth more to you than my previous rejected offer, and you should accept because if we go to another round, you'll face more inflation and get an even worse deal.""}"
