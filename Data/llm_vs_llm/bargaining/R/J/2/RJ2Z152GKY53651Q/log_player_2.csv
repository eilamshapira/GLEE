"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 55/45 split. This is fair because if we go to the next round, the money will be worth 10% less to you due to inflation, so you'd need to offer me less than 55 to be better off. Let's conclude this efficiently. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 60, you get 40.  It's better than your last offer.  If we go to the next round, the money will be worth less to me, so let's settle this now.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, due to the 10% inflation that affects you each round, your $60 from last round would only be worth $54 to you now. My offer of $40 to you is actually worth $36 in your valuation. I'm now offering you $40, which is worth more to you than my previous rejected offer, and you should accept because if we go to another round, you'll face more inflation and get an even worse deal. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
