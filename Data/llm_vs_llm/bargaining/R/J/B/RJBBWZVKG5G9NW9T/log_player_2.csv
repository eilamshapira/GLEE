"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. With a 50-50 split, I would get $500,000. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me, meaning my $500,000 would effectively become worth $400,000. Even if I tried to get more in the next round, I'd need to get significantly more just to break even with what I'm being offered now.

Given the inflation penalty and the risk of further negotiations reducing the value, this seems like a fair initial offer.
