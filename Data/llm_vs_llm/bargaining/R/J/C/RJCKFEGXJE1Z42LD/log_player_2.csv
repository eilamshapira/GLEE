"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $400,000 out of $1,000,000
2. This is a 40-60 split in Alice's favor
3. If I reject, the total amount will decrease by 10% to $900,000 in the next round
4. I could propose a better split in the next round, but Alice might reject
5. $400,000 is still a substantial amount of money

While I could try to negotiate for more, there's a risk of losing value through inflation and potential continued rejections. The current offer is reasonable enough to consider accepting.
