"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice is offering me 400,000$ out of 1,000,000$
2. If I reject, we move to next round where I can make an offer
3. However, due to 10% inflation, my money will be worth 10% less in the next round
4. 400,000$ now is better than potentially 440,000$ in the next round (due to inflation)
5. Alice's opening offer is somewhat fair, giving me 40% of the total

Given the inflation penalty and the relatively fair initial offer, I'll accept.
