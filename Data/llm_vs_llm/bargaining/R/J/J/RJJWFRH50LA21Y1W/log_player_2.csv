"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $400,000 out of $1,000,000
2. If I reject, the next round's money will be worth 20% less to me
3. After inflation, if I make a counter-offer next round, my $400,000 would only be worth $320,000 to me
4. This first offer is a 40-60 split, which isn't terrible
5. Given the inflation penalty, getting a significantly better deal might be difficult
6. Better to secure a good amount now than risk losing value through negotiation
