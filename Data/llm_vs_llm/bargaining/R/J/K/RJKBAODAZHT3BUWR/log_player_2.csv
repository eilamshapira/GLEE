"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair and split it 50-50. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Given that:
1. Alice offers a 50-50 split ($50 each)
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 10% less for me in the next round
3. The money doesn't lose value for Alice
4. I would need to make the next offer if I reject

A 50-50 split is generally considered fair, and if I reject, I would need to get significantly more than $50 in the next round just to make up for the 10% loss. Even if I make a different offer next round, Alice might reject it, leading to further devaluation for me.
