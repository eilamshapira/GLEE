"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the 20% value loss you face each round, this offer is actually better for you than getting 500k in a later round. Let's conclude this now to maximize our mutual benefit. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
