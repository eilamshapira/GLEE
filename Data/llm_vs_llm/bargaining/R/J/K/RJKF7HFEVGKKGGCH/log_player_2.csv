"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's only fair given the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Since Alice faces a 20% loss in value each round and I don't, I could potentially get a better deal by rejecting this offer. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, Alice's share would only be worth 80% of its current value to her, which gives me negotiating leverage.

Given this advantage, a 50-50 split isn't optimal for me. I can get a better deal by continuing the negotiation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice faces a 20% depreciation per round and I don't, I can propose a deal that's more favorable to me while still being attractive to Alice given her time pressure. For her, accepting a smaller amount now is better than an even smaller effective amount later.

{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, considering the 20% value loss you face each round, this offer is actually better for you than getting 500k in a later round. Let's conclude this now to maximize our mutual benefit.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, given the 20% inflation hit I'm taking each round, this offer of 400k for me and 600k for you is equivalent to the 50/50 split we started with. Let's end this fairly. 
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this. Alice is offering me 600k, which is actually the same amount I just offered her. She's correct that due to the 36% inflation she's experienced, 400k now is worth about the same as 500k was worth to her in round 1.

However, if I reject this, in the next round her money will be worth even less (about 49% less than round 1), which means I could potentially negotiate for an even better deal. But there's also a risk that this could lead to a less favorable outcome if the negotiation continues too long.

Given that I'm already getting a favorable 60-40 split, and continuing might risk goodwill without substantial guaranteed benefit, I'll accept this offer.
