"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a reasonable offer that gives both of us a good share, but slightly in my favor since I'm making the first move.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose I get $60 and you get $40 - a fair split considering I'm making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept this offer. While it's slightly in my favor at $55, it's a fair division and we shouldn't risk dragging this out too long when we have a reasonable split on the table.
