"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $40 while she keeps $60. While this isn't an even split, it's not terribly unfair. However, since this is just the first round and I have the opportunity to make a counter-offer, I'll reject this and propose something more equitable in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a more balanced split, but still giving a small advantage to Alice to increase the chances of acceptance.

{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55}

This is a fair offer that gives Alice a slight advantage while being more equitable than her initial proposal."
