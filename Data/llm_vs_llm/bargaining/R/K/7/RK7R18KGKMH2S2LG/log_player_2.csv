"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose an equal split of the money. This seems like the fairest approach for both of us, especially since inflation doesn't affect me. Let's make this simple and equitable. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering a 50-50 split ($500,000 each)
2. If I reject, we move to the next round where:
   * I can make an offer
   * My share will be worth 5% less due to inflation
   * $500,000 now is worth more than $500,000 * 0.95 = $475,000 in the next round

While I could try to negotiate for more in the next round, the inflation penalty makes this risky. A 50-50 split is actually quite fair, and trying to get more might result in less value for me due to inflation.
