"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer to split the million dollars.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering a 55/45 split in our favor. I'm taking a slightly larger portion to account for the 5% inflation I'll face if we go to another round. This way, we both walk away with a substantial amount right now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer considering the inflation effects.

{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000}

I see that the inflation is affecting both of us - me at 5% per round and Bob at 10% per round. Since we're both losing value by continuing to negotiate, I'm offering a more balanced split that gives Bob a better deal than my first offer. This way we can finalize the agreement now, before inflation decreases the value further for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 480000
