"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a favorable split while considering that Bob needs to find it acceptable enough to avoid moving to the next round (where my share would be worth 20% less due to inflation).

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this 60-40 split as it gives me a good portion while still being reasonable enough for Bob to potentially accept. If Bob rejects, my next opportunity will be worth less due to inflation, so I want to make a serious first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 20% inflation, if I accept this offer of $350,000, it's actually worth $280,000 to me (350000 * 0.8).

If I reject, I can make another offer next round, but it will be subject to 40% total inflation for my share. The longer this goes on, the less valuable my eventual share becomes.

This offer gives me 35% of the total, which is significantly less than my initial proposal. However, waiting another round means even more value loss due to inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer. Even with inflation, I believe I can propose a better split in the next round that Bob might accept, given that we still have 10 rounds left."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given the inflation (now at 40% for my share) and Bob's previous offer showing his expectations, I need to adjust my strategy. I'll make a more balanced offer that's more likely to be accepted, as further rounds will significantly diminish my gains.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose this 50-50 split as it's completely fair and should be appealing to Bob. With 40% inflation, my $500,000 is worth $300,000 to me, but that's still better than what Bob offered previously. This even split demonstrates good faith and might encourage Bob to accept rather than continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

With 48.8% inflation, if I accept this offer of $400,000, it would be worth approximately $204,800 to me (400000 * 0.512).

Comparing this to previous rounds:
- Round 1: My offer of 600k (rejected)
- Round 2: Bob offered 350k (I rejected)
- Round 3: My offer of 500k (rejected)
- Round 4: Bob now offers 400k

Bob has increased his offer from 350k to 400k, showing some movement toward compromise. If I reject, the next round will have even more severe inflation (around 59% loss), making it harder to get a good outcome.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While not ideal, the increasing inflation makes waiting more rounds very risky, and Bob has shown some willingness to compromise by increasing my share. Getting $204,800 in actual value now is better than risking further devaluation."
