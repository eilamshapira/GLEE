"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a reasonable offer that acknowledges both our interests.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose we split the money equally, $5,000 each. This is a fair and balanced division that benefits us both equally, with no need to risk the 20% inflation penalty by extending to another round."
