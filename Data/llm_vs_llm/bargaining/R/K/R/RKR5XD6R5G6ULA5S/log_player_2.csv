"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm offering a fair split of 55% for me and 45% for you. It's a generous start, considering the inflation impact. Let's conclude this quickly to maximize value! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $450,000 for me
2. If I reject and go to next round:
   - Money will be worth 5% less to me
   - Maximum I could propose would be $950,000 ($1M - 5%)
   - But Alice might reject that, leading to further rounds and more inflation

Alice's offer of 45% ($450,000) is actually quite reasonable considering:
- It's close to a 50-50 split
- Rejecting would mean dealing with 5% inflation
- Further negotiations could lead to worse outcomes due to compounding inflation
- There's no guarantee Alice would accept a more favorable offer from me

I think it's best to accept this reasonable first offer rather than risk losing value through inflation in subsequent rounds.
