"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split, let's end this quickly before inflation hurts us both 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing a 60-40 split in her favor, giving me $4,000 and herself $6,000. 

While this isn't an even split, I should consider the inflation factor. If I reject, the total value decreases by 10% for me in the next round. That means we'd be dividing $9,000 (from my perspective) in round 2. Even if I proposed a more favorable split then, I'd be working with a smaller total.

Given that inflation will continue to erode value with each passing round, and considering we only have 12 rounds total before we both get nothing, I think it's reasonable to accept this first offer rather than risk further devaluation.
