Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, to beat the inflation before it hurts our deals any further, I'm proposing a quick settlement: I take $600,000 and you get $400,000. Let's avoid delays and secure as much value as possible. Looking forward to your decision â€“ Alice.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm proposing a 50-50 split which seems fair to both of us. We both face the risk of inflation with further delays, so this equal division allows us both to walk away with substantial value. Let's agree and finalize this now. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
