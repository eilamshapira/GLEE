"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to beat the inflation before it hurts our deals any further, I'm proposing a quick settlement: I take $600000 and you get $400000. Let's avoid delays and secure as much value as possible. Looking forward to your decision â€“ Alice. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate whether Alice's offer is reasonable given the inflation constraint.

The offer gives me $400,000 and Alice gets $600,000. If I reject this and we go to the next round, the total value decreases by 10% for me. So in the next round, we're effectively dividing $900,000 from my perspective.

If I make a counteroffer in round 2, I could potentially get more than $400,000, but the delay means I'm working with a smaller total sum. Plus, Alice might reject my offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation.

Given that we have a 10% inflation penalty each round and I don't know how inflation affects Alice, accepting this first offer might be prudent rather than risking further devaluation.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that acknowledges the inflation risk while seeking a more balanced split.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm proposing a 50-50 split which seems fair to both of us. We both face the risk of inflation with further delays, so this equal division allows us both to walk away with substantial value. Let's agree and finalize this now.""}"
