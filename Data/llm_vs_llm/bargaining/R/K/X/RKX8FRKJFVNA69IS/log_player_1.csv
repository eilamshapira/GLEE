"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob, considering the inflation factor that affects me more than him.

{""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that accounts for the 5% inflation penalty I face each round. If we delay, the total value decreases for me, so this is beneficial for both of us to agree now. You get a substantial $4,500 without any waiting or negotiations.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think an equal split is a fairer approach. This way, we both get an equal share, and we can conclude the game without further inflation losses. Let's agree and finalize this. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
