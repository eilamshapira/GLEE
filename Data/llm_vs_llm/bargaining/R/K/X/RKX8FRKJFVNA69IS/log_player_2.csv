"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that accounts for the 5% inflation penalty I face each round. If we delay, the total value decreases for me, so this is beneficial for both of us to agree now. You get a substantial $4500 without any waiting or negotiations. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
