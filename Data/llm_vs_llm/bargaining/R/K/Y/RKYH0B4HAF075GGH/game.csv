55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that slightly favors me as the first mover. I'm facing 20% inflation per round, so delaying would cost me significantly. This offer gives us both a good outcome without needing to lose value through multiple rounds.",Alice,1,

31.59,68.41,"Hi Alice, I understand that delaying costs us both – especially you with that 20% hit. To avoid further losses, I propose a split where I take $68.41 and you get $31.59. This offer reflects our respective inflation challenges and is fair in that it gives you just enough to be indifferent to waiting, while preserving my better discount rate. Let's settle now and save our money from devaluing further.",Bob,2,

50.0,50.0,"Bob, I understand we both face inflation, though at different rates. Your last offer was quite uneven. I'm proposing a perfectly equal 50-50 split, which is fair to both of us. If we continue negotiating, we both lose more value - I lose 20% and you lose 10% each round. This equal division maximizes our collective outcome while being fair to both parties. Let's agree and end the game now.",Alice,3,

28.57,71.43,"Hi Alice, given our respective discount rates, every round we delay costs us substantially. In round 4, my money is worth 0.729 of its nominal value and yours just 0.512, which makes further delay very painful for you. If you reject, you'll have to propose in round 5 and, following standard reasoning, you’d end up with an effective value similar to what this offer gives you (about $14.63 in real terms). To avoid additional losses from inflation, I propose a division where I receive $71.43 and you receive $28.57. Let's settle now and save more value for both of us.",Bob,4,

45.0,55.0,"Bob, let's be practical. We've both lost significant value through these negotiations - I've lost nearly 50% and you've lost over 27%. Your offers have been increasingly one-sided despite my attempts at fairness. This 45-55 split acknowledges your slightly better inflation position while still being reasonably balanced. Further negotiations will destroy even more value for both of us. Let's end this now with a split we can both accept rather than continue this destructive cycle.",Alice,5,
,,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your effort to find a balanced solution, but given our discount factors I expect a better outcome by proposing next round. With my discount rate deteriorating less severely (about 0.9 per round versus your 0.8), I can structure a proposal in round 6 that will improve my effective value. Let's keep negotiating and see if we can reach an agreement shortly.",Bob,5,reject
28.57,71.43,"Hi Alice, considering the progression of our negotiation and the different inflation impacts—my funds losing 10% per round and yours 20%—the mathematics of our alternating-offer setting indicate that the fair equilibrium split, when I'm the proposer, gives me 71.43 and you 28.57 (of the nominal $100). This division ensures that you receive exactly what you'd expect if you waited to propose next round, after accounting for your steeper discount. Let’s settle now before further rounds erode our money's value.",Bob,6,
