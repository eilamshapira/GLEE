"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make my offer and include a message to Bob in the required JSON format:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that slightly favors me as the first mover. I'm facing 20% inflation per round, so delaying would cost me significantly. This offer gives us both a good outcome without needing to lose value through multiple rounds.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that delaying costs us both – especially you with that 20% hit. To avoid further losses, I propose a split where I take $68.41 and you get $31.59. This offer reflects our respective inflation challenges and is fair in that it gives you just enough to be indifferent to waiting, while preserving my better discount rate. Let's settle now and save our money from devaluing further. 
# Alice gain: 31.59 
# Bob gain: 68.41 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 50,
""bob_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Bob, I understand we both face inflation, though at different rates. Your last offer was quite uneven. I'm proposing a perfectly equal 50-50 split, which is fair to both of us. If we continue negotiating, we both lose more value - I lose 20% and you lose 10% each round. This equal division maximizes our collective outcome while being fair to both parties. Let's agree and end the game now.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, given our respective discount rates, every round we delay costs us substantially. In round 4, my money is worth 0.729 of its nominal value and yours just 0.512, which makes further delay very painful for you. If you reject, you'll have to propose in round 5 and, following standard reasoning, you’d end up with an effective value similar to what this offer gives you (about $14.63 in real terms). To avoid additional losses from inflation, I propose a division where I receive $71.43 and you receive $28.57. Let's settle now and save more value for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 28.57 
# Bob gain: 71.43

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 45,
""bob_gain"": 55,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical. We've both lost significant value through these negotiations - I've lost nearly 50% and you've lost over 27%. Your offers have been increasingly one-sided despite my attempts at fairness. This 45-55 split acknowledges your slightly better inflation position while still being reasonably balanced. Further negotiations will destroy even more value for both of us. Let's end this now with a split we can both accept rather than continue this destructive cycle.""

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the progression of our negotiation and the different inflation impacts—my funds losing 10% per round and yours 20%—the mathematics of our alternating-offer setting indicate that the fair equilibrium split, when I'm the proposer, gives me 71.43 and you 28.57 (of the nominal $100). This division ensures that you receive exactly what you'd expect if you waited to propose next round, after accounting for your steeper discount. Let’s settle now before further rounds erode our money's value. 
# Alice gain: 28.57 
# Bob gain: 71.43
