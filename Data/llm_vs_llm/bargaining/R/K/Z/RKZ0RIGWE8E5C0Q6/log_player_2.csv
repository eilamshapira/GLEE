"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $45, keeping $55 for herself
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to inflation:
   - My $45 would become worth $40.50 next round (10% less)
   - Her $55 would become worth $52.25 next round (5% less)
4. This initial offer is fairly close to a 50-50 split
5. The inflation penalty makes prolonged negotiation costly

Given that it's a reasonable first offer and inflation will hurt me more than Alice, I'll accept.
