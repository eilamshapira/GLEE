5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm suggesting an equal split of the money. This seems fair to both of us, and we can conclude the game immediately without worrying about the inflation affecting your share in future rounds.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Hi Alice, while an even split sounds good, I'm feeling a bit adventurous. How about a 60/40 split in my favor?  We can wrap this up now and both enjoy our gains.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but let's be strategic here. Due to the 20% inflation that affects your share each round, waiting is costly for you. This 55/45 split in my favor actually gives you more value than if we delay further. If we go to round 5, your money would be worth 40% less. Let's settle now with this reasonable offer.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, you raise some valid points about the inflation. However, I'm still confident in my position. Let's meet in the middle - a 55/45 split in my favor. This acknowledges the time pressure while still giving me a slight advantage. Deal?",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"Bob, we need to be realistic about the inflation impact. Your money is now worth almost 50% less than in round 1, and will be worth 60% less next round. This 60/40 split in my favor actually gives you more real value now than waiting further. If we reach round 7, your share would be worth less than half its original value. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances - let's conclude this now.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, let's stop wasting time. I acknowledge the inflation is working against me, but I'm also aware you want to finalize this deal. Let's go back to the original offer - a 50/50 split. It's fair and avoids the risk of both of us walking away with nothing.",Bob,6,
