Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but let's be strategic here. Due to the 20% inflation that affects your share each round, waiting is costly for you. This 55/45 split in my favor actually gives you more value than if we delay further. If we go to round 5, your money would be worth 40% less. Let's settle now with this reasonable offer. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we need to be realistic about the inflation impact. Your money is now worth almost 50% less than in round 1, and will be worth 60% less next round. This 60/40 split in my favor actually gives you more real value now than waiting further. If we reach round 7, your share would be worth less than half its original value. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances - let's conclude this now. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

I need to hold firm a little longer. Accepting 4000 is starting to look better than getting zero, but I think Alice will crack soon."

""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. I acknowledge the inflation is working against me, but I'm also aware you want to finalize this deal. Let's go back to the original offer - a 50/50 split. It's fair and avoids the risk of both of us walking away with nothing.""
