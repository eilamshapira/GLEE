"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I'll start with a proposal. My offer is:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the inflation, accepting this offer means I'm effectively getting less than 50 in real terms.

Therefore, I will **reject** this offer.
```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for round 3, taking into account that the value of money to me is less than it was initially (due to inflation).

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the inflation, accepting this offer means the money I receive is worth significantly less than the original amount. Let's calculate what I'm effectively getting:

*   Original value of $100: 100
*   Inflation on Alice's gain: 14.26%

So, I would be receiving: 60 * (1 - 0.1426) = 51.44

Considering the decreased value of the money, and with further rounds potentially decreasing its value, I will **accept** the offer.
```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
