"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer. She's proposing a 50-50 split, which is perfectly fair and equitable. While I could try to negotiate for more in the next round, there's also a risk that we might end up with less favorable terms or fail to reach an agreement within the 12 rounds.

A 50-50 split is a rational and fair solution that respects both parties. I'll accept this offer.
