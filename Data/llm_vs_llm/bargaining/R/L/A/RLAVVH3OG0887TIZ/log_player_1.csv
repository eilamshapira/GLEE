Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation risk, but I'm the one facing a guaranteed 10% loss each round. I propose a more balanced split that still gives you a significant portion while acknowledging my time pressure. If we keep going back and forth, we both risk getting much less. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500
