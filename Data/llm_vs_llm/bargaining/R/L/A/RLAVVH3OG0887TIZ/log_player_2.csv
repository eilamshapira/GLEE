"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take a bit more to account for the inflation risk. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing that I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000. She mentions accounting for inflation risk, but I need to be mindful that with each passing round, the money is worth 10% less to me.

If I reject and move to round 2, I can make a counter-offer, but the total value to me would be reduced by 10%. So in round 2, the $10,000 would effectively be worth $9,000 to me.

This initial offer gives me 40% of the total. While not equal, it's not terrible given the inflation pressure I face. If I reject and we go back and forth too many times, we both risk getting nothing.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I need to make a reasonable counter-offer that accounts for the inflation pressure I'm under while still being fair enough that Alice might accept.

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concern about inflation risk, but I'm the one facing a guaranteed 10% loss each round. I propose a more balanced split that still gives you a significant portion while acknowledging my time pressure. If we keep going back and forth, we both risk getting much less.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. Let's meet in the middle. This offer is fair considering the time pressure we both face. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's new offer. She's now proposing I get $4,500 while she gets $5,500, which is a more balanced split than her initial offer. However, due to inflation, the money is now worth 19% less to me than in the first round, so my $4,500 is effectively worth about $3,645 in round 1 terms.

If I reject and we move to round 4, the inflation penalty would increase further, reducing the value even more. Alice has moved $500 in my direction from her initial offer, which shows willingness to compromise.

While I'd prefer a more equal split, the inflation pressure is significant. If we continue negotiating for several more rounds, my share could diminish substantially due to inflation, even if I get a nominally larger amount.
