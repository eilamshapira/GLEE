"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly and avoid inflation losses 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance. However, if I reject now, I can make my own offer in the next round. The downside is that the money will be worth 5% less for me.

If I reject and propose something like 60-40 in my favor in the next round, Alice might reject, leading to further rounds and more inflation losses. The even split guarantees me $50 right now.

Given the inflation penalty and the risk of getting nothing after 12 rounds, accepting a fair split in the first round seems like the rational choice.
