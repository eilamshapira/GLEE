Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll think carefully. Since the money I gain is worth 9.75% less, I'll calculate the actual value. 
The offer of 4200 is equivalent to approximately 4200 * 0.9025 = 3792.5 in the first round's value.
I'll reject this offer, hoping for a better deal.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, the total value of the money is now worth less to me. I'll try to make a reasonable offer.
Since I don't know the inflation effect on Alice, I'll aim for a slightly more favorable split for myself to account for the loss in value.

Round 5

The offer of 4400 is equivalent to approximately 4400 * 0.8145 = 3582.8 in the first round's value.
This is still a bit low, but I need to consider that the value will continue to decrease for me. I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Round 6
