"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, I need to consider that when evaluating the offer. The $45 offered to me is actually worth $45 * 0.9 = $40.5 to me.

Considering this, I think the offer is not in my favor.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less with each round, and we're now in the third round, the money I gain is worth 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 of its original value.

To make up for this loss, I'll make an offer that favors me slightly.

{""alice_gain"": 52.5, ""bob_gain"": 47.5}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round (0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.729), the $42 offered to me is actually worth $42 * 0.729 = $30.58 to me.

Considering this significant decrease in value, I think I should accept the offer to avoid further losses.
