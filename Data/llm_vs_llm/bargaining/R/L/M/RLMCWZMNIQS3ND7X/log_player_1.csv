"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make my offer for dividing $100 with Bob, keeping in mind that with each passing round, the money is worth 10% less to me due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I suggest we split the money 60/40, which gives you a good portion while still being fair to Bob. Given that inflation will reduce the value for me each round, it makes sense to reach an agreement now that benefits both of us rather than dragging negotiations out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's 50/50 split offer. While it's less than my initial proposal, the 10% inflation penalty means that delaying further would reduce the value of my share. A 50/50 split now is better than potentially getting less value in future rounds due to continued inflation."
