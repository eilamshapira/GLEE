"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split of the money. This seems equitable for both of us. With inflation reducing the value by 20% each round for me, it's in my interest to settle quickly, and I imagine you might have similar concerns. Let's avoid the risk of running out of rounds and both getting nothing. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
