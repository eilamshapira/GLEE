5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose an even split of $5000 each. This way we both secure our fair share immediately without any delay that could diminish our winnings. What do you think?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, I understand your desire for an even split, but considering the inflation factor affecting me, I need a bit more to make it fair from my perspective. I propose I get $5500 and you get $4500. This way, we both still get a good amount, and I'm compensated for the risk of inflation.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, I appreciate your reasoning regarding inflation and your need for compensation. However, given that my share's value is unaffected by inflation and that I will have the opportunity to propose an offer next round which can safeguard my interests even better, I must decline your proposal. Let's continue to negotiate in hopes of a mutually beneficial split.",Alice,2,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, understanding that every further round chips away at the real value of your share while mine remains intact, I propose we settle in round 3. You would receive a nominal $4000 and I would receive $6000. Even though $4000 in this round depreciates (roughly 40% less in purchasing power than round 1), accepting this deal gives you a real value of about $2400, which is likely more favorable than waiting another round and facing even steeper discounting for you as the proposer. I believe this offer balances our interests given the inflation challenges you face. What do you say?",Alice,3,
