"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose an even split of $5000 each. This way we both secure our fair share immediately without any delay that could diminish our winnings. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire for an even split, but considering the inflation factor affecting me, I need a bit more to make it fair from my perspective. I propose I get $5500 and you get $4500. This way, we both still get a good amount, and I'm compensated for the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your reasoning regarding inflation and your need for compensation. However, given that my share's value is unaffected by inflation and that I will have the opportunity to propose an offer next round which can safeguard my interests even better, I must decline your proposal. Let's continue to negotiate in hopes of a mutually beneficial split.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, understanding that every further round chips away at the real value of your share while mine remains intact, I propose we settle in round 3. You would receive a nominal $4000 and I would receive $6000. Even though $4000 in this round depreciates (roughly 40% less in purchasing power than round 1), accepting this deal gives you a real value of about $2400, which is likely more favorable than waiting another round and facing even steeper discounting for you as the proposer. I believe this offer balances our interests given the inflation challenges you face. What do you say?""}"
