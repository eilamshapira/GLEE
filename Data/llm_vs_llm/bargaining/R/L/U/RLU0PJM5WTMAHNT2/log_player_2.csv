"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose an even split of $5000 each. This way we both secure our fair share immediately without any delay that could diminish our winnings. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your desire for an even split, but considering the inflation factor affecting me, I need a bit more to make it fair from my perspective. I propose I get $5500 and you get $4500. This way, we both still get a good amount, and I'm compensated for the risk of inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, understanding that every further round chips away at the real value of your share while mine remains intact, I propose we settle in round 3. You would receive a nominal $4000 and I would receive $6000. Even though $4000 in this round depreciates (roughly 40% less in purchasing power than round 1), accepting this deal gives you a real value of about $2400, which is likely more favorable than waiting another round and facing even steeper discounting for you as the proposer. I believe this offer balances our interests given the inflation challenges you face. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
