"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair offer since we're starting this negotiation game.

{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000}

I'm proposing that I get $525,000 and Bob gets $475,000. This is a reasonable split that gives both of us a substantial share, with me taking a slightly higher amount since I know inflation will affect my share in future rounds if we don't reach an agreement now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer since Bob is asking for significantly more than I proposed, and even though inflation has started affecting my gains, I can still make a better counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll adjust my offer to find a middle ground, accounting for the inflation pressure I'm facing.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing an equal 50-50 split of $500,000 each. This is a fair compromise between our previous positions, and given that inflation is reducing my effective gains with each round, I think an equal division is reasonable and should be acceptable to both of us."
