55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob! Let's split the money fairly. I'm proposing a 55/45 split. If we go to another round, inflation will reduce the total value, so we'll both walk away with less. This way we both get a good amount right away.",Alice,1,

40.0,60.0,"Let's be realistic, I'm taking a bigger risk by going to the next round with inflation. I'm being generous with 40%",Bob,2,

50.0,50.0,"Bob, let's be fair and do a 50/50 split. With increasing inflation, we're both losing value with each round. Even with a 5% inflation on my side, 50% now is better than continuing this back and forth where we both lose. This is an equitable split - let's finish this efficiently.",Alice,3,
