"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make my initial offer to Bob:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob! Let's split the money fairly. I'm proposing a 55/45 split. If we go to another round, inflation will reduce the total value, so we'll both walk away with less. This way we both get a good amount right away.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be realistic, I'm taking a bigger risk by going to the next round with inflation. I'm being generous with 40% 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Bob, let's be fair and do a 50/50 split. With increasing inflation, we're both losing value with each round. Even with a 5% inflation on my side, 50% now is better than continuing this back and forth where we both lose. This is an equitable split - let's finish this efficiently.""
