"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Let's split the money fairly. I'm proposing a 55/45 split. If we go to another round, inflation will reduce the total value, so we'll both walk away with less. This way we both get a good amount right away. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, 
""alice_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Let's be realistic, I'm taking a bigger risk by going to the next round with inflation. I'm being generous with 40%""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be fair and do a 50/50 split. With increasing inflation, we're both losing value with each round. Even with a 5% inflation on my side, 50% now is better than continuing this back and forth where we both lose. This is an equitable split - let's finish this efficiently. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
