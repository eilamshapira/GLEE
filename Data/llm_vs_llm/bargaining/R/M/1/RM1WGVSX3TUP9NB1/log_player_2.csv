"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $40 while she gets $60. While this isn't an equal split, it's not terribly unfair. However, since this is just the first round and I have more opportunities to negotiate, I'll reject this offer and propose my own split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a more balanced split, but slightly in my favor since Alice's first offer was in her favor.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has moved closer to an equal split, offering me $45 instead of her initial $40. While I could hold out for a perfect 50-50 split, we're getting closer to a fair deal, and with limited rounds remaining, there's risk in continued negotiation. However, since she rejected my previous offer of 55-45, I think there's still room for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice has shown willingness to move toward the middle by offering 45-55, I'll propose a perfectly fair split this time. This should be harder to reject and shows I'm reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}"
