"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first move.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable first offer that gives both of us a substantial portion, with a small advantage to me as the first mover."
