"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I take a bit more, but you still get a fair share. Let's end this early to avoid inflation effects for you. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I need to act quickly. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I'll calculate the effective value of Bob's offer.

Effective value of Alice's gain: 4500 * 0.8 = 3600

While it's not an even split, I don't want to risk further inflation effects. I'll accept Bob's offer to minimize losses.
