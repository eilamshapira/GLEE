"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. This offer gives you a substantial amount while ensuring we both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $400,000 out of $1,000,000
2. If I reject, we move to the next round, but:
   - I'll lose 5% value due to inflation
   - I'll get to make the next offer
3. Current offer value: $400,000
   Next round maximum value: $950,000 (95% of original)

While the split isn't exactly 50-50, $400,000 is still a significant amount. If I reject, I'll need to make up for the 5% loss in the next round, and Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to further inflation losses.
