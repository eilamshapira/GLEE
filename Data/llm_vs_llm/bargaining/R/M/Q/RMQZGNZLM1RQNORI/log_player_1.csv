"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an initial offer to Bob. Since we're in the first round and both of us would benefit from a quick resolution, I'll propose a fair split.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 6000 for me and 4000 for you is a fair deal, considering we both have to take a 20% hit on the money if we keep going.  Let's get this over with. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm countering with a 60-40 split in my favor. You mentioned a 20% inflation hit on your end, but that's not affecting me according to the rules. If we go another round, you'll face an even larger inflation penalty. This offer gives you a better outcome than what you'd get if we continue to the next round.""}"
