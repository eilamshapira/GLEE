Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm countering with a 60-40 split in my favor. You mentioned a 20% inflation hit on your end, but that's not affecting me according to the rules. If we go another round, you'll face an even larger inflation penalty. This offer gives you a better outcome than what you'd get if we continue to the next round. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000
