6000.0,4000.0,Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you get 40%.  What do you think?,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, I think a more balanced split is fair. Since you face 10% inflation each round while I face only 5%, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement now. I'm proposing $5500 for me and $4500 for you, which is reasonable considering the game structure.",Bob,2,
