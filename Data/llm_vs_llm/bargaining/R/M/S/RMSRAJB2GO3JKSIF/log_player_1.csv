"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I think a more balanced split is fair. Since you face 10% inflation each round while I face only 5%, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement now. I'm proposing $5500 for me and $4500 for you, which is reasonable considering the game structure. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
