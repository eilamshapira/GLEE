"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you get 40%.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate if this offer is reasonable, considering the inflation effects in future rounds.

If I reject, we'll go to round 2 where I make an offer, but the total money will be worth 5% less to me and 10% less to Alice. This gives me some leverage since Alice faces higher inflation.

A 60/40 split in Alice's favor doesn't seem optimal for me given the game dynamics. I could likely propose a more favorable split in the next round that Alice would accept due to her higher inflation rate.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Given the inflation dynamics, I'll propose a more balanced split that accounts for the fact that Alice's inflation rate is higher than mine. This gives me some leverage, but I don't want to be too aggressive as we could lose value through more rounds of negotiation.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, I think a more balanced split is fair. Since you face 10% inflation each round while I face only 5%, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement now. I'm proposing $5,500 for me and $4,500 for you, which is reasonable considering the game structure.""}"
