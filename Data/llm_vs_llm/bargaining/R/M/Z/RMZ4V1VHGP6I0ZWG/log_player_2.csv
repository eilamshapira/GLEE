"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split this fairly. I propose 60 for me and 40 for you. It's a good deal for both of us considering the inflation that's coming. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
- The total value will decrease 5% for me and 20% for Alice
- I could propose a split more in my favor, but Alice may reject
- Further rounds would erode value significantly for both of us

Alice's current offer gives me $40. While I could potentially get more by negotiating, the risk of value erosion and Alice rejecting my counter-offer makes this a reasonable deal.
