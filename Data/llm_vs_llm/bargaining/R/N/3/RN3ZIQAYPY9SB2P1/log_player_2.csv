"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. This is round 1, so there's no inflation yet
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in round 2
3. However, in round 2, my share will be worth 20% less due to inflation
4. $40 now is better than $50 in the next round (which would be worth $40 after 20% inflation)
5. The offer is relatively fair - I get 40% of the total

Given that inflation only affects my gains and not Alice's, and that this is a decent first offer, I should accept it. Getting $40 now is better than risking a prolonged negotiation where my potential gains would be reduced by inflation.
