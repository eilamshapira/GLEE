"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $600,000 and giving Bob $400,000, with a message suggesting this is a fair starting point. Your turn to respond as Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I think a 60/40 split in my favor is the best way to start. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I need to consider the reduced value of the money.

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, the $400,000 offered by Bob is actually worth $320,000 to me (80% of $400,000).

Considering this, I think I can do better than that.

My response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation affecting my gain, I need to make a more favorable offer to myself to compensate for the reduced value.

In Round 2, the money was worth 80% of its original value to me. Now, in Round 3, it's worth 80% * 80% = 64% of its original value.

To make up for this, I'll offer Bob a smaller share. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 650000,
  ""bob_gain"": 350000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I need a larger share to make it worth my while. Let's settle this!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $650,000 and giving Bob $350,000, with a message explaining my reasoning. Your turn to respond as Bob!"
