"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a simple division. I'll take 80% and you can have 20%. It's a good opening offer! 
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Rationale (not part of response): The offer is quite unfair, giving Alice 80% of the money. Even with the different inflation rates affecting us (10% for me, 20% for Alice), I can likely get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round. Since it's early in the game (round 1), I have time to negotiate for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I propose a more fair split. Since you face higher inflation (20%) than I do (10%), this split actually benefits you by finalizing the deal early. Let's be reasonable and settle now.""}

Rationale (not shown to human): I'm offering a more balanced split that's slightly in my favor, but not extremely so. By highlighting the inflation factor, I'm trying to create urgency for Alice to accept, as delay hurts her more than me. The 55-45 split is fair enough that it might be accepted, but still gives me a good outcome."
