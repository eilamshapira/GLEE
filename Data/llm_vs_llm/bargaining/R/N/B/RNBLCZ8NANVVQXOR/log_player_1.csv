Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since we're at round 2 and the money's already less valuable for me, let's split it straight down the middle. Fair? 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
