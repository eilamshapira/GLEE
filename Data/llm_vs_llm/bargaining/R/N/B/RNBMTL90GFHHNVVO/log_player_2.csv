"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's start with a fair split. I propose I get $550000 and you get $450000. This gives me a slight advantage for proposing, but is a good starting point to avoid losing money to inflation. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Alice's offer is slightly skewed in her favor (55% vs 45%), and while she argues this is fair due to her being first to propose, I don't find this completely convincing.

With inflation at 5% per round, rejecting would mean the total value in the next round would be $950,000. If I can get a better proportion of that, it might be worth rejecting.

However, there's also risk in rejecting - Alice might make an even less favorable counter-offer, and we could end up in a cycle of rejections that damages both our potential gains.

Given that $450,000 is still a substantial amount and the risks of rejection, I'll accept this offer.
