"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is proposing that I (Bob) get $40 and she gets $60. Since this is the first round, the money hasn't lost any value yet. However, if I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me. Let me evaluate this offer.

I need to consider that if I reject, even if I propose a higher amount for myself in the next round, its value to me will be reduced by 20%. For example, if I were to get $50 in round 2, it would effectively be worth $40 to me (50 Ã— 0.8).

Given this inflation penalty that only affects me, Alice's offer of $40 is reasonable. If I reject, I'd need to secure significantly more in the next round to offset the 20% loss in value.
