"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's a fair offer for both of us. I get $600000 and you get $400000. Let's finish the game early before inflation starts to eat into our money. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000, which is 40% of the total. If I reject, we move to the next round where I can make a counter-offer, but the total money will be worth 20% less (so only $800,000 total value).

If I reject and propose in the next round, I could potentially get more than $400,000, but we'd be dividing a smaller pie. For example, if I proposed a 50-50 split in the next round, I'd get $400,000 (50% of $800,000) - which is the same amount I'm being offered now.

Since Alice's offer gives me a substantial portion, and rejecting wouldn't necessarily improve my position due to the inflation penalty, I'll accept this offer.
