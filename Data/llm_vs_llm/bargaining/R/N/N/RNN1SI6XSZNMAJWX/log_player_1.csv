"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to conclude this quickly to avoid inflation losses.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's split it closer to the middle to be fair. How about 55/45? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Bob's offer would give me $4500, but due to 20% inflation, it's actually worth $3600 to me
2. If I reject and we go to next round, any amount I get will be worth another 20% less
3. In round 1, I proposed $6000 for myself, which would have been worth $6000
4. Bob's current offer ($3600 after inflation) is significantly lower than what I proposed
5. However, if I reject, the next round will have even worse inflation for me

Given the significant inflation penalty I'm facing and the risk of getting even less value in the next round, I should accept this offer despite it being lower than I'd like.
