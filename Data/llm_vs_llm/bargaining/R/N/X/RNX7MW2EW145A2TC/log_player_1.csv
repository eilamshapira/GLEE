"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer to Bob for the first round. Given the inflation rate of 10% per round for me, I want to secure a fair deal early on.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose we split the money equally - $50 for each of us. This is a fair division that respects both of our interests. With inflation affecting future rounds for me, it makes sense to reach an agreement now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I notice Bob is trying to take advantage of my inflation penalty. Since the money is worth 20% less to me now than in round 1, I need to adjust my strategy.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose $55 for me and $45 for Bob. This slightly higher amount for me helps offset some of the inflation effect I'm experiencing. This is still a fair offer that gives Bob a substantial portion while recognizing that delays are more costly for me than for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","I see that Bob is making increasingly unfavorable offers, taking advantage of the inflation affecting me. I need to be strategic now, as the money is worth over 30% less to me than in round 1.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose $60 for me and $40 for Bob. This helps compensate for the significant inflation I'm experiencing. Bob should recognize that we're running out of rounds, and continuing to delay only hurts both of us in the long run. This offer still gives Bob a substantial amount while accounting for my worsening position due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","I notice Bob is consistently offering me less money with each round, taking advantage of my inflation penalty. At this point, the money is worth nearly 50% less to me than in round 1, and we only have a few rounds left.

{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}

I propose $65 for me and $35 for Bob. This division helps offset the significant inflation effect I'm experiencing. Bob needs to understand that if we don't reach an agreement soon, we both risk getting nothing. This offer gives Bob a reasonable amount while acknowledging my worsening position due to the continuing inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","The situation is becoming critical. The money is now worth less than half its original value to me, and we only have a few rounds left before we both get nothing. I need to be pragmatic while still trying to get a fair deal considering my disadvantage.

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I propose $70 for me and $30 for Bob. This division reflects the severe inflation penalty I'm facing. With only 3 rounds left after this one, Bob needs to understand that continuing to reject offers puts both of us at risk of walking away with nothing. This offer gives Bob a reasonable amount while attempting to compensate for my significant inflation disadvantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","We're now at a critical juncture with only one round remaining after this. The money is worth less than 40% of its original value to me due to inflation, while Bob experiences no such penalty. I need to make a realistic offer that has a chance of being accepted.

{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}

I propose $75 for me and $25 for Bob. This division accounts for the severe inflation penalty I'm facing. Bob should recognize that this is the second-to-last opportunity to reach an agreement - if we don't agree now or in the next round, we both get nothing. While this gives Bob less than previous offers, it still provides him with a meaningful amount rather than the zero we'll both receive if no agreement is reached."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.
