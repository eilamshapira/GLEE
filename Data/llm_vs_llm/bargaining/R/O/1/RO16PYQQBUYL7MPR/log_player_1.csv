"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair division that considers our different inflation rates.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I suggest I get $60 and you get $40. This is fair considering our different inflation rates - my money loses value at 10% per round while yours loses value at 20% per round. This gives us both good value before inflation affects us too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to find a more compelling division considering our different inflation rates.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest I get $55 and you get $45. Since you're facing higher inflation (20% per round compared to my 10%), accepting now gives you more real value than waiting. This is a fair compromise that benefits both of us before further inflation diminishes our gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
