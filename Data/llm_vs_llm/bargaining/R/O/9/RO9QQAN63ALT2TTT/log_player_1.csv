"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $60 and you receive $40. Since each round delays settlement and reduces my share’s value by 20%, it’s in both our interests to agree quickly. What do you say?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe an equal split would be fair. I propose we each get $50. This is equitable, and we both avoid further inflation penalties by settling now. I'm experiencing 5% inflation per round, and understand you may have your own inflation pressures too. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
