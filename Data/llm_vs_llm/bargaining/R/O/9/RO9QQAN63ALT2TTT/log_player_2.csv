"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $60 and you receive $40. Since each round delays settlement and reduces my share’s value by 20%, it’s in both our interests to agree quickly. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $40 while she gets $60 of the $100. 

She mentioned that her money loses 20% value each round, but the instructions said my money loses 5% value each round. I don't know how inflation affects Alice.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, my $40 would be worth $38 (5% less) if accepted then. If we go multiple rounds, the inflation will continue to reduce the value of my share.

Given the inflation penalty I face and the uncertainty of reaching a better deal in future rounds, I'll evaluate if this initial offer is reasonable.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced counter-offer while acknowledging our mutual interest in resolving this quickly.

{""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe an equal split would be fair. I propose we each get $50. This is equitable, and we both avoid further inflation penalties by settling now. I'm experiencing 5% inflation per round, and understand you may have your own inflation pressures too.""}"
