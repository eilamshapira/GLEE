"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair division while considering that money loses more value for me (10%) than for Bob (5%) in future rounds. I'll aim for a reasonable split that Bob would likely accept.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose this division because it's fairly balanced while giving me a slight advantage as the first mover. It acknowledges that if Bob rejects, we'll both lose value, with me losing more (10%) than Bob (5%) in the next round."
