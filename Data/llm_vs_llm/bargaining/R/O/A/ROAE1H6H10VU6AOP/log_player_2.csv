"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to think carefully about this offer.

Alice is offering me $45 while taking $55 for herself. While this isn't an even split, I need to consider the inflation effect. If I reject this offer:
- In the next round, I'll make an offer, but the total money will be worth 5% less to me
- It will be worth 10% less to Alice

So, if I reject and move to round 2, the $100 will effectively be worth $95 to me and $90 to Alice.

Given these conditions, I could potentially get more in the next round, but I'm already being offered a substantial portion. $45 now is better than the risk of getting less later if we can't reach agreement in future rounds.
