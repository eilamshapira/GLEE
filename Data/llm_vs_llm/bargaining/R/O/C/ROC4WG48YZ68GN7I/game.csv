60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor.

Let's avoid multiple rounds of negotiation and settle on this reasonable division.",Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Considering the inflation penalty I face, I believe a 55-45 split in my favor is more reasonable. This way, we both get a significant share, and I'm compensated for the potential loss of value in the next rounds.",Bob,2,
