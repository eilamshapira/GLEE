"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make my first offer to Bob, considering the inflation factor that affects my gains in future rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering that if we go to the next round, inflation will reduce the value of my share by 20%, while you might not face the same penalty. Let's avoid multiple rounds of negotiation and settle on this reasonable division.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation penalty I face, I believe a 55-45 split in my favor is more reasonable. This way, we both get a significant share, and I'm compensated for the potential loss of value in the next rounds. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
