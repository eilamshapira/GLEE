"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering that if we go to the next round, inflation will reduce the value of my share by 20%, while you might not face the same penalty. Let's avoid multiple rounds of negotiation and settle on this reasonable division. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Considering the inflation penalty I face, I believe a 55-45 split in my favor is more reasonable. This way, we both get a significant share, and I'm compensated for the potential loss of value in the next rounds.""}"
