6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor because I face a 20% inflation penalty per round. If we delay, the total value decreases for me while staying the same for you. This split is fair given that asymmetry.",Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor. I'm proposing a 55-45 split recognizing that you face inflation. Let's close this out fairly.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still facing increasing inflation penalties. At this point, my share is already worth 20% less than in round 1. Let's meet in the middle with this 55-45 split in my favor. This accounts for the inflation I face while still giving you a substantial portion. If we continue to next round, I'll lose even more value while you don't.",Alice,3,
