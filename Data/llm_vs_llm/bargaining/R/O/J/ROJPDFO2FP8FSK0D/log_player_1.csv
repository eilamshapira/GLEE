"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make my initial offer to Bob.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor because I face a 20% inflation penalty per round. If we delay, the total value decreases for me while staying the same for you. This split is fair given that asymmetry.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor. I'm proposing a 55-45 split recognizing that you face inflation. Let's close this out fairly. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still facing increasing inflation penalties. At this point, my share is already worth 20% less than in round 1. Let's meet in the middle with this 55-45 split in my favor. This accounts for the inflation I face while still giving you a substantial portion. If we continue to next round, I'll lose even more value while you don't.""
