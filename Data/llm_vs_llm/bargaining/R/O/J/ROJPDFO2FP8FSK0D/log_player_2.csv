"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor because I face a 20% inflation penalty per round. If we delay, the total value decreases for me while staying the same for you. This split is fair given that asymmetry. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is right about the inflation penalty, a 60-40 split in the first round heavily favors her.  I'm willing to wait for a more balanced proposal in a future round. By rejecting, I put the pressure on Alice to offer a more equitable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor. I'm proposing a 55-45 split recognizing that you face inflation. Let's close this out fairly.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still facing increasing inflation penalties. At this point, my share is already worth 20% less than in round 1. Let's meet in the middle with this 55-45 split in my favor. This accounts for the inflation I face while still giving you a substantial portion. If we continue to next round, I'll lose even more value while you don't. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to a more equitable split, and while it's not ideal, further delay will likely result in offers even less favorable to me.  It's time to accept and secure a reasonable share before inflation further erodes the value for Alice, potentially leading to more aggressive proposals."
