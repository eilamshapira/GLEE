"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fair offer. Since inflation doesn't affect me but might affect you over time, I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. This still gives you a substantial $450000 while acknowledging the potential advantage of time on my side. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
