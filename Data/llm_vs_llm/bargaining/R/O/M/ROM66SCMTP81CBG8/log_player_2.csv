"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the amount equally, ensuring fairness for both of us. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that Alice is offering a 50-50 split which would give me $500,000, I need to consider if this is a good deal.

The problem states that inflation doesn't affect me (0% less each round), so there's no financial penalty for me to continue negotiating. However, I don't know how inflation affects Alice, which could potentially give me leverage in later rounds if it affects her negatively.

Since there's no cost to me for continuing negotiations and I might be able to get a better deal in the next round, I'll reject this fair offer to see if I can improve my position.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll offer a slightly better deal for myself while still being reasonable, since I have the advantage of not being affected by inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""I appreciate your fair offer. Since inflation doesn't affect me but might affect you over time, I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. This still gives you a substantial $450,000 while acknowledging the potential advantage of time on my side.""}"
