"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I need to maximize my gain, taking into account the decreasing value of the money for me and the 12-round limit. Since this is round 1, I'll start with a relatively generous offer to increase the chance of acceptance.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 800 
# Bob gain: 9200 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a terrible offer! Even with the inflation, 800 is far too low. I will reject and hope I can get a better offer when it's my turn again.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's my turn again. The money is now worth 40% less to me than in round 1. I need to be strategic. Bob seems to be aiming for a very uneven split.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, this is getting ridiculous. Bob is clearly trying to push me to the limit. I need to make him understand I won't accept ridiculously low offers.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1
