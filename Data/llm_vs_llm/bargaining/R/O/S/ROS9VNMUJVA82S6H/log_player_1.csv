"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 475000, ""bob_gain"": 525000, ""message"": ""Hey Bob, I propose a fair initial split where you take a slightly larger share as a sign of goodwill. How does $525K for you and $475K for me sound? This will ensure you leave with more than me and we both benefit without letting inflation take a toll. Let's seal the deal!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be realistic, Alice. I'm taking a bigger risk by rejecting your initial offer. Considering the inflation factor, I think this split is more reasonable. It's still a generous offer, but it reflects the value of taking the risk. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
