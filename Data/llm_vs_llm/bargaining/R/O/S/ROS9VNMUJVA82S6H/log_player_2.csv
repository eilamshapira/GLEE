"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I propose a fair initial split where you take a slightly larger share as a sign of goodwill. How does $525K for you and $475K for me sound? This will ensure you leave with more than me and we both benefit without letting inflation take a toll. Let's seal the deal! 
# Bob gain: 525000 
# Alice gain: 475000
