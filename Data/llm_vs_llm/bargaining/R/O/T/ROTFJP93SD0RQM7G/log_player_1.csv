"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob that takes into account the 5% inflation penalty I face each round.

{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Bob! Since I face a 5% inflation penalty each round, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because if we go to the next round, the total value decreases for me, so we both benefit by agreeing now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think a 55-45 split is more fair, considering we both lose value in the next round. Let's agree and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
