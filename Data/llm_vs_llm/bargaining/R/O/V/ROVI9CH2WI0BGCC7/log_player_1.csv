"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a strategic first offer, considering that my money loses 10% value each round while Bob's doesn't. I should aim for a fair but advantageous split.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this split because:
1. It gives me a larger share to compensate for potential value loss if negotiations continue
2. It's not too greedy, giving Bob a substantial amount
3. It leaves room for negotiation if Bob declines"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. If I accept Bob's 50-50 split now:
   * My $500,000 is worth 10% less = $450,000 in original value
   * Bob gets full $500,000

2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make another offer
   * But my share will be worth another 10% less
   * Risk of further devaluation if negotiations continue
   * Bob has no value loss pressure

Given that:
- The offer is already less favorable than my initial proposal
- Further rounds will only decrease my money's value
- There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal later
- Bob might be even less willing to accept an uneven split now
