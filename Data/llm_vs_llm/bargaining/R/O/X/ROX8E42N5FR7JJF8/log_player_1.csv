"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Let me think strategically. Since Bob's money devalues faster (20% vs my 5%), he has more pressure to agree earlier. I'll make a somewhat favorable offer for myself but not too extreme.

{""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split. Given that your money devalues faster at 20% per round compared to my 5%, this is a fair offer that gives you significant value now rather than risking further devaluation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the devaluation concern. How about a 45/55 split? It's closer to the middle while still acknowledging the time pressure. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Due to inflation, the $550,000 I would get is worth 5% less than first round value, so effectively worth $522,500
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount would be worth another 5% less
3. Bob's money is devaluing much faster (20% per round), which gives me leverage in later rounds
4. However, extended negotiations reduce value for both of us
5. This is actually a reasonable offer considering the devaluation factors
