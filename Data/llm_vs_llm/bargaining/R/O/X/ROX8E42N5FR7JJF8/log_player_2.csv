"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60-40 split. Given that your money devalues faster at 20% per round compared to my 5%, this is a fair offer that gives you significant value now rather than risking further devaluation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
