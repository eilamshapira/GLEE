"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since we're both losing value with each round, and you're losing it faster (20% vs my 10%), this is a fair split that benefits us both if we agree now. You'll get $450000 now, which is worth more than a larger sum in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
