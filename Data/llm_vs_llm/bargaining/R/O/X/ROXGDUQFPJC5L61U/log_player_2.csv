"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair division. I take the majority, and you still get a significant amount. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $200,000 for me, $800,000 for Alice

2. If I reject:
- Next round I can make an offer
- Money will be worth 10% less for me (I'll value it at 90%)
- Money will be worth 20% less for Alice (she'll value it at 80%)
- This gives me negotiating leverage since she's losing value faster

3. This first offer gives Alice 80% of the money, which seems quite unfair considering we're starting with equal bargaining positions.

4. I can likely get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round, even accounting for the 10% depreciation.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a strategic offer:

1. Given the depreciation:
- For me, the money is now worth 90% of original value
- For Alice, it's worth 80% of original value

2. Since Alice is losing value faster, I should propose a more balanced split, but one that still gives her a good incentive to accept rather than continue to the next round where she'd lose another 20%.

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Since we're both losing value with each round, and you're losing it faster (20% vs my 10%), this is a fair split that benefits us both if we agree now. You'll get $450,000 now, which is worth more than a larger sum in future rounds.""}"
