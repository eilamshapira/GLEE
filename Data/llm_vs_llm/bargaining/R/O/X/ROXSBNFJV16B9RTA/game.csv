4750.0,5250.0,"I appreciate the offer of a 50/50 split, but to make it worthwhile for me to agree so early, I need a slightly higher share to account for the risk. How about a 52.5/47.5 split in my favor?",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
4750.0,5250.0,"Bob, I understand your need for a higher share, but considering the inflation effect on my side, I propose we stick to your last offer but with a slight adjustment to account for the decreased value of money for me. Let's go with 47.5/52.5 in your favor, as you suggested last round, but keep in mind the urgency to settle before the value drops further.",Alice,3,
