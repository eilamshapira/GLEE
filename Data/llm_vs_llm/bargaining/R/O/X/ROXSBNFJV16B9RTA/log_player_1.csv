"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer of a 50/50 split, but to make it worthwhile for me to agree so early, I need a slightly higher share to account for the risk. How about a 52.5/47.5 split in my favor? 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 4750,
  ""bob_gain"": 5250,
  ""message"": ""Bob, I understand your need for a higher share, but considering the inflation effect on my side, I propose we stick to your last offer but with a slight adjustment to account for the decreased value of money for me. Let's go with 47.5/52.5 in your favor, as you suggested last round, but keep in mind the urgency to settle before the value drops further.""
