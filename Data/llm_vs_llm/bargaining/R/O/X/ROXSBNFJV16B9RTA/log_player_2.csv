""alice_gain"": 4750,
""message"": ""I appreciate the offer of a 50/50 split, but to make it worthwhile for me to agree so early, I need a slightly higher share to account for the risk. How about a 52.5/47.5 split in my favor?""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your need for a higher share, but considering the inflation effect on my side, I propose we stick to your last offer but with a slight adjustment to account for the decreased value of money for me. Let's go with 47.5/52.5 in your favor, as you suggested last round, but keep in mind the urgency to settle before the value drops further. 
# Bob gain: 5250 
# Alice gain: 4750 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
