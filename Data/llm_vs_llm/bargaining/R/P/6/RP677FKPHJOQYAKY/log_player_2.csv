"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's start with a fair offer for me, considering the looming inflation. This gives us both a good starting point. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
1. She's offering me $45 and keeping $55
2. The money doesn't lose value for me in future rounds
3. While the split isn't perfectly equal (50/50), it's fairly close
4. I have the option to counter-offer, but there's no guarantee Alice will accept a better deal
5. Starting with a reasonable offer saves time and reduces risk of reaching round 12 with no agreement

Given that it's a decent offer and I don't lose value to inflation, I could try to negotiate for more. However, the current offer is reasonable enough that the risk of continuing might not be worth the potential small gain.
