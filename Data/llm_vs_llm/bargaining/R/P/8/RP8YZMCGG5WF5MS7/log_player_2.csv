"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer seems fair, but I need to consider the effects of inflation. If I reject and propose in the next round, the money will be worth 10% less to me. Let me think about this carefully.

A 50-50 split is generally equitable, and I'd receive $500,000. If I reject and propose next round, even if I ask for more, the total value will be decreased by 10% for me. That means the maximum value I could potentially receive would be from 100% of $900,000 (since it's worth 10% less to me), which equals $900,000.

Since I could potentially get more in the next round, I'll reject this offer to try for a better deal, while being mindful of the decreasing value with each round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a split that accounts for the inflation effect I'm experiencing while still being reasonable enough for Alice to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, given that I'm facing inflation pressure of 10% per round. This way, I receive more than the initial offer while still leaving Alice with a substantial portion that should be fair enough for her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 590490 
# Alice gain: 409510 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer considering the inflation effect on my side.

Due to 19% inflation for me, the $590,490 Alice is offering would be worth approximately:
$590,490 × (1 - 0.19) = $590,490 × 0.81 = $478,297 in round 1 value

In round 1, I was offered $500,000. This current offer is worth less to me than the original offer, even though the nominal amount is higher.

However, if I reject and go to the next round, inflation will increase to around 27.1% (compounding 10% each round), further reducing the value of any amount I might receive. If Alice is strategic, she might offer me even more in nominal terms, but it could be worth even less due to increasing inflation.

I'll accept this offer to avoid further value erosion.
