Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, since money devalues faster for you (20%) than for me (10%), this split is actually favorable for both of us. If you reject, you'll lose more value than I will in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000
