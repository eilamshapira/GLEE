"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start off on a good foot, Bob. This offer ensures a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice's offer gives me $350,000 and her $650,000
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
   * The money will be worth 10% less for me (worth $900,000 to me)
   * The money will be worth 20% less for Alice (worth $800,000 to her)
   * This gives me more leverage for a better deal

Given that the money will devalue more quickly for Alice (20%) than for me (10%), I can likely get a better deal by rejecting this first offer and making my own proposal next round. Alice will be more inclined to accept a better offer for me since her money is devaluing faster.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a strategic offer considering our different inflation rates:

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, since money devalues faster for you (20%) than for me (10%), this split is actually favorable for both of us. If you reject, you'll lose more value than I will in the next round.""}

Reasoning:
1. This is a more balanced offer considering the devaluation rates
2. For Alice, rejecting means the next round's million would be worth only $800,000 to her
3. My message emphasizes the economic logic to encourage acceptance
4. I've increased my share but kept Alice's portion substantial enough to be attractive"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation rates are different, but your previous offer wasn't fair to me.  This offer provides a more balanced outcome. Let's close the deal. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Current offer: $450,000 for me, $550,000 for Alice
2. With 19% inflation for me, this $450,000 is worth about $364,500
3. If I reject and go to next round:
   * Money will be worth 29% less for me (another 10%)
   * Money will be worth 56% less for Alice (another 20%)
   * The total value is deteriorating quickly for both of us
4. Alice's offer is actually quite reasonable considering:
   * It's better than her first offer
   * The rapid value deterioration
   * The risk of further rounds reducing value significantly

Given the accelerating losses from inflation and the fair improvement from the initial offer, I should accept this deal now before we lose more value.
