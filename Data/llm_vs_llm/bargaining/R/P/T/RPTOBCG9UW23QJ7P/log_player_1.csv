"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a strategic first offer, considering that both of us face diminishing value in future rounds, but Bob's value diminishes faster (20% vs 10% per round). I should make a reasonable offer to avoid too many rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this split because:
1. It gives me a good portion while still being fair enough that Bob might accept
2. If Bob rejects, the next round's total value will be worth less to both of us
3. It acknowledges that Bob needs a substantial amount to consider accepting"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Bob is offering a 50-50 split
2. Due to inflation:
   * My $5000 is now worth $4500 (10% less)
   * Bob's $5000 is now worth $4000 (20% less)
3. If I reject, we'll move to round 3 where values will decrease further
4. A 50-50 split is quite fair, and considering inflation will keep eating into both our shares, accepting now would be reasonable
