"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer would give me $4,000 out of the $10,000 total. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 20% less to me.

Let me think about this. If I reject, the $10,000 will effectively be worth $8,000 to me in the next round. I could then propose a more favorable split, but Alice might also reject, causing further inflation.

Given the asymmetric inflation rates (20% for me vs 10% for Alice), delaying tends to hurt me more than her. While I could potentially get more than $4,000 by making a counter-offer, there's risk in continuing.

However, the first offer of 40% for me and 60% for her seems somewhat unbalanced in Alice's favor. I think I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more balanced counter-offer, taking into account that we're already in round 2, meaning the money is worth less to both of us (though more significantly to me).

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split which is fair and equitable. Given the asymmetric inflation rates, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly, and this even division should be acceptable to Alice."
