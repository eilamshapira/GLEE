"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a split that considers both our positions and the asymmetric inflation rates. Since I face a higher inflation rate (20% vs 5%), I should aim for a favorable first-round deal.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering that if Bob rejects, the total value will decrease more significantly for me than for him in the next round. The split gives him a substantial portion while protecting my interests against the higher inflation rate I face."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

My effective gain if I accept:
$450,000 Ã— 0.8 = $360,000 (due to 20% inflation)

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round:
- The money will be worth 40% less for me and 10% less for Bob
- The bargaining position will worsen due to higher inflation impact on my side

While this offer gives Bob more than my initial proposal, the inflation impact makes accepting this offer more rational than continuing to negotiate. If I reject, my future gains will be significantly diminished by the higher inflation rate I face.
