"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider my position carefully. The offer is a 50/50 split, which seems fair at first glance. However, with inflation affecting me at 20% per round, if I reject and make a counter-offer, the total value will decrease for me.

If I accept now, I get $50.
If I reject and make a counter-offer, even if I ask for more next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me, so I'd need to get significantly more to beat the current offer.

Given the inflation penalty and the fair initial offer, I'll accept.
