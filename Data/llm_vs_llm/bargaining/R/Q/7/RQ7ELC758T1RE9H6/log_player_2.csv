"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I take 60, you take 40. Deal? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100
2. If I reject, the next round will have 10% inflation, so the $100 will be worth $90 to me
3. While $40 now is less than half, I need to consider that delaying might cost me more due to inflation
4. However, I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer, considering that Alice values immediate resolution but also acknowledging that I'm affected by inflation:

{""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. This is better for both of us than letting inflation eat into the value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's find a middle ground. I'll take 55, you take 45. This way, we both get a decent share before inflation takes too much value. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $45, but due to 19% inflation, it's actually worth about $36.45 to me
2. If I reject, next round will have even more inflation (29%)
3. Alice has moved from her initial 60-40 split to a 55-45 split, showing willingness to compromise
4. Given the increasing inflation and the risk of further negotiations reducing value, this is actually a reasonable offer
5. While I could counter-offer, the inflation risk is becoming significant
