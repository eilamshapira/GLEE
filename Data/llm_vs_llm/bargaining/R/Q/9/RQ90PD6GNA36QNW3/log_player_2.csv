"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you $400000 and I'll take $600000. This is actually a better deal for you than it might seem at first. If we go to another round, inflation will hit you much harder (20% vs my 5%). Let's settle now to maximize our combined value. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering the impact of inflation on both of us, I propose $550,000 for me and $450,000 for you. This way, we both get a fair share before the value drops further, especially for me. Let's end this now and both walk away with a good deal.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're concerned about inflation, which affects you more than me. However, that's exactly why I need a larger share. At this point, your $330000 after 20% inflation is worth about the same as $412500 from round 1, while my $670000 after 5% inflation is worth about $636500 from round 1. This is actually quite balanced considering our different inflation rates, and if we continue to the next round, you'll lose even more value. Let's finalize this deal now. 
# Bob gain: 330000 
# Alice gain: 670000

Round 4

This round, my share would be worth about $262,144 from round 1's value, and yours would be worth about $365,000. It's a fair split considering our different inflation rates, and it's crucial we settle now to minimize further loss for both of us.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical about this. My $720000 at this point is worth about $593000 in round 1 value (after 18.5% cumulative inflation), while your $280000 is worth only about $143000 in round 1 value (after 59% cumulative inflation). If we go to the next round, your money will lose another 20% value while mine only 5%. Think about it - this offer actually gives you more real value than what you offered me previously, and continuing will only hurt us both. Let's end this now with a fair split considering our vastly different inflation rates. 
# Bob gain: 280000 
# Alice gain: 720000

My proposal of $650,000 for me and $350,000 for you reflects the urgent need to settle. At this point, my share would be worth about $266,240 from round 1's value, and yours would be worth about $284,750. It's a compromise that considers our different inflation rates and aims to end this before we lose even more. Let's agree now to salvage what we can.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we need to conclude this negotiation now. At this point, inflation has severely impacted both of us, but especially you. My $770000 is worth about $567000 in round 1 value (after 26.5% cumulative inflation), while your $230000 is worth only about $75000 in round 1 value (after 73.8% cumulative inflation). This is actually getting close to an even split in terms of original value! If we go another round, your share becomes nearly worthless. This offer maximizes our combined value - please accept so we can both walk away with something meaningful.
