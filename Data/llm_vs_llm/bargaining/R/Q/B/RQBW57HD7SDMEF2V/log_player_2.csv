"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this division reflects our positions in this negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000 total, which is 40%.

Considering that:
1. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
2. There's no inflation for me according to the rules, so waiting doesn't reduce my potential gain
3. $400,000 is a substantial amount, but less than half of the total

While I could potentially get more by rejecting and making my own proposal, there's also uncertainty about Alice's acceptance of my counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I believe a 50-50 split would be the fairest division for both of us. This way we both get an equal share of the total amount.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the desire for an even split, but time is important here. Let's meet in the middle - this offer is fair and lets us both benefit sooner rather than later. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has increased her offer to me from $400,000 to $450,000, which is a $50,000 improvement. I note that she's now facing inflation (19% less value for her), which explains why she might be more willing to compromise.

Let me analyze this situation:
1. If I accept, I get $450,000 immediately
2. If I reject, I can make another counter-offer, but Alice may reject again
3. Alice seems to be approaching the middle ground between her initial offer and my 50-50 proposal
4. The inflation is affecting Alice but not me, which gives me a slight advantage in negotiations

Given that Alice has moved significantly toward a more even split and I'm not affected by inflation, this seems like a reasonable compromise.
