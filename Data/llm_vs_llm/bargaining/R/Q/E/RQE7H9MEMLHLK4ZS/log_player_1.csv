"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1, considering the potential for future losses due to inflation:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

My reasoning is that this split gives me a slight advantage, but it's reasonable enough for Bob to accept, especially considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money for him. I prioritize a quick resolution to avoid further losses from inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this offer. Bob is offering an even split. However, considering the inflation, the $50 he's offering to me is worth 5% less than it was in Round 1.

Let's consider whether to accept or reject. If I reject, I will make a proposal in round 3. Then, the money would be worth 10% less for me.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
