"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my offer for Round 1.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose I get $550,000 and you get $450,000. This is a fair split considering the different inflation rates we face. Since my money devalues faster at 20% per round compared to your 10%, it makes sense for me to get a slightly larger portion now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose I get $600,000 and you get $400,000. This accounts for our different inflation rates - my money is devaluing faster (20% per round vs your 10%), and we're already in round 3. With this split, we can both walk away with substantial value rather than continuing to lose money to inflation."
