48.0,52.0,"Hi Alice, since the money loses value faster for you (20% per round vs my 5%), waiting is costlier for you. This split is fair considering our different inflation rates. If we continue to round 3, your $48 would only be worth about $38 to you, while my loss would be much smaller.",Bob,2,

52.0,48.0,"Bob, I understand your point about the inflation rates. However, I'm still losing more value. Let's meet in the middle a bit. I propose $52 for me and $48 for you.",Alice,3,
