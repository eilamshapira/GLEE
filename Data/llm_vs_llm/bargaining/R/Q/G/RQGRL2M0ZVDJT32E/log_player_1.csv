"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since the money loses value faster for you (20% per round vs my 5%), waiting is costlier for you. This split is fair considering our different inflation rates. If we continue to round 3, your $48 would only be worth about $38 to you, while my loss would be much smaller. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
