Let's see if Bob agrees to a 50/50 split!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This time, I'm offering a slightly larger share for myself, recognizing that Bob's gains are worth less due to inflation. Let's see if he bites!"
