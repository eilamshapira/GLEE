"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. Since this is the first round, I'm facing 500,000$ with no inflation yet. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 10% less to me. If Alice rejects my counter-offer, we'll be in round 3 with 20% inflation, and so on.

500,000$ now is better than potentially getting more later with increasing inflation risk. Also, this is a fair 50-50 split which shows good faith from Alice.
