350000.0,650000.0,"Alice, I propose a 65-35 split in my favor. We both lose money to inflation with each passing round. This is a more equitable division, reflecting the risk you're taking by rejecting offers. Let's agree and both profit.",Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I'm willing to compromise with a 55-45 split. Remember that I lose 20% to inflation each round while you only lose 10%. If we keep going, we both lose. This is a fair middle ground - let's make a deal now.",Alice,3,

425000.0,575000.0,"Alice, I'm meeting you in the middle. 57.5-42.5 split. We are running out of time, and the declining value of the money is significant. Let's agree on this and secure a worthwhile profit.",Bob,4,
