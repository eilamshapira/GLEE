"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. Given that I'm making the first move and taking the initiative, I believe this is a fair offer. Let's not waste time and lose money to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose a 65-35 split in my favor. We both lose money to inflation with each passing round. This is a more equitable division, reflecting the risk you're taking by rejecting offers. Let's agree and both profit. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The offer is too low, especially considering I'll lose 20% to inflation in each round. I'll make a better counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to compromise with a 55-45 split. Remember that I lose 20% to inflation each round while you only lose 10%. If we keep going, we both lose. This is a fair middle ground - let's make a deal now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm meeting you in the middle. 57.5-42.5 split. We are running out of time, and the declining value of the money is significant. Let's agree on this and secure a worthwhile profit. 
# Alice gain: 425000 
# Bob gain: 575000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. With my 48.8% inflation penalty, this $425,000 is worth about $217,600 in original value terms. If I reject and continue, the inflation will eat away even more value, and we risk getting nothing if we reach round 12. This isn't ideal, but it's better than continuing the negotiation with such severe inflation effects."
