Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I think a 50-50 split is the fairest approach. I'm offering us both $5000 each. Remember that with each round, the money loses 10% value for me due to inflation, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon. This is a balanced proposal that maximizes our collective outcome. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
