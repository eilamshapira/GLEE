"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split this fairly. I'm offering you 3000$, take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this carefully. Alice is offering me 3000$ out of 10,000$, which is only 30% of the total. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but I'll face 10% inflation, meaning the total value to me will be 9,000$ instead of 10,000$.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2, I'd need to get more than 3,333$ (which is equivalent to 3000$ now after 10% inflation) for rejection to be worthwhile.

Since I can make the next proposal and potentially get a better deal, and Alice's initial offer is quite uneven, I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer while accounting for the inflation factor.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I think a 50-50 split is the fairest approach. I'm offering us both $5,000 each. Remember that with each round, the money loses 10% value for me due to inflation, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon. This is a balanced proposal that maximizes our collective outcome.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Alright Bob, I see you're not playing nice. This time it's 6500 for me, 3500 for you. Last chance before I start taking more! 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer carefully considering the inflation effects.

In round 1, Alice offered me $3000. Now she's offering $3500, but with 19% inflation, this $3500 is actually worth $2835 to me compared to round 1 values ($3500 Ã— 0.81 = $2835).

If I reject, we go to round 4 where I can make an offer, but the inflation would be even worse for me. The total value would decrease further, and Alice seems to be getting more aggressive with her demands.

Since Alice's current offer is actually worth less to me than her initial offer due to inflation, and she's threatening to take even more in future rounds, I should accept this offer now before the situation worsens.
