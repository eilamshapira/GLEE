Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a fair offer to Bob in the first round.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation effect on my side, I need a bit more to make it fair from my perspective. This split ensures that we both get a good amount, but it also accounts for the risk I'm taking by not accepting your previous offer. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to analyze Bob's offer carefully. 

Bob says he's experiencing 20% inflation on his side, which means each dollar is worth less to him now. He's asking for $5,500 (compared to my initial offer of $5,000 for each of us), while offering me $4,500.

Since I'm not affected by inflation (my money is worth the same as in round 1), I would get $4,500 if I accept. If I reject, we'll go to another round where I can make a counter-offer, but Bob might experience even more inflation, potentially making negotiations harder.

Given that we're only $500 apart from my initial equal split offer, and considering the risk of further rounds making agreement more difficult, I'll accept this offer.
