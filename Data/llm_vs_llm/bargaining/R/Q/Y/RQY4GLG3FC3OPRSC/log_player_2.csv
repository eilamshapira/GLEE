"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I take $208333 and you get $791667. Given our respective discount factors, waiting only decreases both our real gainsâ€”yours by 5% per round and mine by 20%. Accepting now gives you what you'd secure later while avoiding further devaluation. Let's settle this round. 
# Bob gain: 791667 
# Alice gain: 208333 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
