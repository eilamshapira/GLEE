55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split where I get $55 and you get $45. This is slightly in my favor since I go first, but considering the inflation impacts you more than me (20% vs 10% per round), accepting now maximizes your value. If we go to the next round, your $45 now would only be worth $36 to you.",Alice,1,
