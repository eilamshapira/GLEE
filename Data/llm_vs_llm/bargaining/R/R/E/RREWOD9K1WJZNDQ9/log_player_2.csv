"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split where I get $55 and you get $45. This is slightly in my favor since I go first, but considering the inflation impacts you more than me (20% vs 10% per round), accepting now maximizes your value. If we go to the next round, your $45 now would only be worth $36 to you. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $45, while she takes $55.

If I reject and we move to the next round, my money will be worth 20% less, while hers is only worth 10% less. This means my $45 now would indeed be worth only $36 to me in the next round (45 Ã— 0.8 = 36). 

If I make a counter-offer next round, I'd need to ask for significantly more to offset my higher inflation rate. However, Alice might reject that, leading to further rounds and more value loss for both of us, especially me.

Given the asymmetric inflation rates that disadvantage me more, accepting now is likely the best strategy to maximize my value.
