Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your openness to discussion. I'm proposing a more balanced split at 52-48, which is still favorable to you while being more equitable. Let's not lose value to inflation by prolonging negotiations. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
