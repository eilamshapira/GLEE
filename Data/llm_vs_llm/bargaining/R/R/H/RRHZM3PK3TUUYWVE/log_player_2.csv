"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'm open to discussion! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice proposes I get $4000 while she gets $6000
2. This is not an equal split (60-40 in her favor)
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
4. However, the money will be worth 10% less next round
5. It's better to negotiate early while the money has more value

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a counter-offer in the next round, aiming for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split, but still giving Alice a slight advantage to encourage acceptance:

{""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""I appreciate your openness to discussion. I'm proposing a more balanced split at 52-48, which is still favorable to you while being more equitable. Let's not lose value to inflation by prolonging negotiations.""}"
