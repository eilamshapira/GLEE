"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000}
```
Explanation:

This offer is slightly generous to Bob to increase the chances of him accepting it right away. A 50/50 split might seem fair, but Bob has an incentive to wait and see if he can get more in later rounds, especially since we don't know how inflation affects him. Offering him slightly more upfront makes it more likely he'll take the deal to avoid the risk of getting a worse offer later."
