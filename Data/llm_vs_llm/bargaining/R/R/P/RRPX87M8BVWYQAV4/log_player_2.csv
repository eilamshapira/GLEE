"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $475,000 while she gets $525,000. This is close to a 50-50 split, with Alice taking a slightly larger portion.

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but I need to remember that inflation will reduce the value of the money by 10% for me. So the total $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $900,000 to me in the next round.

Since the current offer gives me $475,000, and making a perfect counter-offer in the next round would at most give me $900,000 (assuming I could get 100% of the money), there's significant risk in rejecting.

Given that Alice's offer is fairly reasonable (close to 50-50) and the inflation penalty makes waiting costly, I'll accept this offer.
