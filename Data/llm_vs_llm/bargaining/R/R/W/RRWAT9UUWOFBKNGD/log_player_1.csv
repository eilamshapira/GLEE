"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a slightly favorable split for me, considering that Bob has the power to decline but also needs to factor in the 5% inflation penalty if he does.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

This offer gives Bob a substantial amount while leaving me with a reasonable advantage. If Bob declines, the money will be worth less in the next round due to inflation, which should make this offer more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept, I get $450,000, but with 5% inflation, it's actually worth $427,500 to me
2. If I reject, we go to next round where:
   - I can make a new offer
   - But my gains will be worth another 5% less
   - I'd need to secure significantly more money to offset the inflation
   - Bob knows this and might offer even less next time

Given that:
- The current offer is fairly balanced (close to 50-50)
- The inflation penalty is significant and compounds
- There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal next round
- Bob might be even more aggressive in future rounds
