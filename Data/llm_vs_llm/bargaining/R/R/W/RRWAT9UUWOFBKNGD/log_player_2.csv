"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $450,000 while she gets $550,000 out of the $1,000,000 total. While this isn't an even split, it's reasonably close to a 50-50 division.

Since there's no inflation for me across rounds (0% less value), I don't lose anything by rejecting and making a counter-offer. However, I don't know how inflation affects Alice, which creates some uncertainty.

Given that I can make a counter-offer in the next round if I reject, and there's no cost to me for another round, I'll reject this offer and propose something more favorable to me in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more favorable split for myself while still making it attractive enough for Alice to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing that I receive $550,000 and Alice receives $450,000. This is essentially the reverse of Alice's initial offer, giving me the larger share while still being reasonably fair. Since there's no inflation affecting me, but there might be inflation affecting Alice's value, it may be in her interest to accept this offer rather than extending the negotiation further."
