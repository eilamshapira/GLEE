"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll send a fair offer to Bob that takes into consideration the inflation effect on my side.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a slightly higher amount for myself to account for the 10% inflation penalty I face in future rounds. This is a fair first offer that gives you a substantial portion while recognizing my disadvantage if negotiations continue.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, since I don't face any inflation penalty, I'm proposing a split that's more favorable to me. This is still a fair offer giving you a substantial portion of $450000. If you reject, we'll lose more time in negotiations, which you mentioned affects you due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
