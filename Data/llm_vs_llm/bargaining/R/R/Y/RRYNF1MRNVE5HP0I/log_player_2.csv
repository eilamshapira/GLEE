"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a slightly higher amount for myself to account for the 10% inflation penalty I face in future rounds. This is a fair first offer that gives you a substantial portion while recognizing my disadvantage if negotiations continue. 
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice's offer gives me $460,000 and herself $540,000
2. She claims she faces 10% inflation penalty in future rounds, but I should only trust what I know for certain
3. I know my inflation rate is 0%, so my money's value won't decrease in future rounds
4. If I reject, I can make my own proposal next round, and my position is actually stronger since I don't face any inflation

Given that:
- I don't face any inflation penalty
- I can make a counter-offer next round without losing value
- The current split (46%-54%) isn't particularly favorable to me
- I'm in a stronger negotiating position than Alice seems to think

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more favorable to me while still being reasonable:

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, since I don't face any inflation penalty, I'm proposing a split that's more favorable to me. This is still a fair offer giving you a substantial portion of $450,000. If you reject, we'll lose more time in negotiations, which you mentioned affects you due to inflation.""}"
