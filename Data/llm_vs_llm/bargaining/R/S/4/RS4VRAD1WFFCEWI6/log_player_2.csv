"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $400,000 while she gets $600,000 out of the $1,000,000. 

If I reject, we move to round 2 where I make the offer, but the total value decreases by 20% to $800,000. This means even if I propose a 50-50 split in round 2, I would get $400,000 - exactly what Alice is offering me now.

Any further rounds would result in even less money due to the 20% inflation per round.
