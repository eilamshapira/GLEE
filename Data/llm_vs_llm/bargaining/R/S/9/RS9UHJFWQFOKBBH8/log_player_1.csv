"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll consider my offer carefully given the inflation impact on each round. Since I'm playing as Alice and the money loses 20% of its value for me with each passing round, it's in my interest to reach an agreement sooner rather than later.

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering the inflation pressure on my side. By accepting this now, we can both walk away with a substantial amount rather than risking further depreciation."
