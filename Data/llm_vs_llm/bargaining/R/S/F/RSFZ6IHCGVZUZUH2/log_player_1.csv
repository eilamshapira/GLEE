"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, the $40 offered to me is actually worth $40 * 0.9 = $36 to me.

Considering this, I think I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Due to inflation, the money I gain is now worth 10% less than in the previous round, and 20% less than in the first round (10% in round 1 + 10% in round 2 = 20% less than the original value, but since it's cumulative, it's 10% * 10% = 1% more than 20%, so 10% + 10% - 1% = 19% less, approximately, but for simplicity, we will consider 10% less in each round, so in round 3, I will consider it 30% less, 10% in round 1, 10% in round 2 and 10% in round 3).

The money I gain is worth $1 * (1 - 0.1)^3 = $0.729 per $1.

I'll make an offer that takes this into account.
