"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair but strategic split, considering that Bob's money loses 5% value each round while mine doesn't.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose this split because:
1. It's a reasonable starting offer that gives Bob a significant portion
2. If Bob rejects, his share will be worth less in the next round due to 5% inflation
3. It acknowledges my stronger position (no inflation penalty) while still being fair enough to potentially get accepted"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer:

1. This is actually a better offer for me than what I proposed (60/40)
2. If I reject, Bob's future gains will be worth even less due to inflation
3. There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in future rounds
4. This is a very reasonable offer that gives me the majority share

Since this offer is better than my initial proposal and provides me with a good share, I'll accept it.
