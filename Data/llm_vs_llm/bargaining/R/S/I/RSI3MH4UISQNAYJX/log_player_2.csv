"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering the offer where I get $4000 and Alice gets $6000.

Given that we need to divide $10,000, this is a 40/60 split in Alice's favor. While it's not exactly equal, it's not an unreasonable offer. Since there's no inflation for me (0% inflation means the money retains its value in future rounds), I don't lose anything by rejecting and making a counter-offer.

However, I don't know how inflation affects Alice, which introduces uncertainty. If Alice faces high inflation, she might be more willing to accept a better offer from me in the next round. On the other hand, if she faces no inflation either, we could end up in a stalemate.

I think I can propose a more favorable split for myself in the next round, so I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split that's still advantageous to me but reasonable enough that Alice might accept it.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split of the $10,000 where I receive $5,500 and Alice receives $4,500. This gives me a slight advantage while still offering Alice a substantial portion of the money. Since we both started with nothing, this represents a significant gain for both of us, and accepting this offer would end the negotiation immediately with both of us benefiting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering the new offer where I get $4200 and Alice gets $5800.

This offer is slightly better for me than Alice's first offer ($4200 vs $4000). I also now have new information - Alice is facing significant inflation (19% so far), which means her money is worth less the longer we negotiate.

Given that:
1. Alice improved her offer to me slightly
2. Alice faces inflation while I don't
3. If I reject, we'll go to another round where I can make an offer, but Alice's inflation will increase further
4. Alice has already rejected my 5500/4500 split

Alice clearly wants more than $4500, but her bargaining position weakens with each round due to inflation. If I reject now, I could potentially get more in the next round as Alice's inflation pressures her to accept.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Now that I know Alice faces significant inflation (19% already and likely increasing with each round), I'll adjust my offer to be more favorable to me while still being attractive enough for Alice to accept given her weakening position.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

I propose this split of the $10,000 where I receive $6,000 and Alice receives $4,000. Since Alice is experiencing inflation that reduces the value of her money with each passing round, it's in her interest to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. This offer still gives Alice a substantial portion that, even with inflation, represents a significant value. If she rejects, her next round's gains will be worth even less due to increasing inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering the new offer where I get $4400 and Alice gets $5600.

This offer continues the pattern of Alice slightly improving her offers to me ($4000 → $4200 → $4400). Meanwhile, Alice's inflation has increased significantly to 34.39%, meaning her $5600 is effectively worth only about $3674 compared to the original value.

Important considerations:
1. Alice continues to face increasing inflation (now 34.39%)
2. Alice has improved her offer again
3. My last offer of 6000/4000 was rejected
4. I don't face any inflation, so waiting costs me nothing

Alice's position continues to weaken with each round. If I reject now, I can make another counter-offer, and Alice will face even greater inflation pressure to accept. The trend suggests Alice might be willing to accept a better offer for me in the next round due to her rapidly devaluing gains.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given Alice's rapidly increasing inflation (now at 34.39%) and the pattern of our negotiations so far, I'll improve my offer slightly from my previous one but still maintain a strong advantage.

{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200}

I propose this split of the $10,000 where I receive $5,800 and Alice receives $4,200. This represents a $200 improvement for Alice compared to my last offer, showing I'm willing to compromise. However, with Alice's significant inflation rate (which will likely increase further in the next round), accepting this offer immediately would be in her best interest. Her $4,200 now is worth more than a potentially larger amount in future rounds when inflation has further eroded its value. Since I face no inflation, I can afford to wait, but Alice's position weakens substantially with each passing round."
