Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I think we can do a little better - how about a 60/40 split in my favor? It's still a significant amount for you. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
