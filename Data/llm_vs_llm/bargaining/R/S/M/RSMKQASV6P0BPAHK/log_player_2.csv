{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I think we can do a little better - how about a 60/40 split in my favor? It's still a significant amount for you.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's try to find a compromise. How about 52 for me and 48 for you? Given inflation is only affecting your gains, this is a better deal for you than my previous offer was for me. I think this is a fair way to meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
