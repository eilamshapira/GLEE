# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting both of us, but more significantly affecting Alice's gain, I should consider the decreasing value of the money. However, Alice's offer is still not in my favor.

# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
