"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value I'd get is 42 * 0.64 = 26.88 (since it's 36% less than the original, which is equivalent to 64% of the original value).

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Due to inflation, the money I gain is worth 36% less than in the first round, and it will be worth even less in this round (40% less, since 20% less in round 2 and another 20% less in round 3, combined is 36%, and now another 20% less, which is 1 - (1 - 0.2)(1 - 0.36) = 0.488, or approximately 51.2% of the original value, but I will calculate it as 40% less, which is 60% of the original value).

I'll make an offer, taking into account the reduced value.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value I'd get is 43 * 0.4096 = 17.62 (since it's approximately 59.04% less than the original, which is equivalent to 40.96% of the original value).

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","Due to inflation, the money I gain is worth even less. I'll make an offer, taking into account the reduced value.

Considering I rejected the previous offers, I should make a more generous offer to Alice, while still trying to get a decent share for myself.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value I'd get is 44 * 0.2621 = 11.52 (since it's approximately 73.79% less than the original, which is equivalent to 26.21% of the original value).

Given the significant decrease in value, I should consider accepting an offer that gives me a relatively higher share, even if it's not ideal.
