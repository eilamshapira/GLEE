"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to make a proposal that's appealing enough for Bob to accept it quickly, while still getting a good portion for myself. Since this is round 1, I should start with a fairly generous offer to avoid a long and potentially fruitless negotiation. I'll assume Bob is rational and also wants to avoid losing everything after 12 rounds.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I see. Bob rejected my generous offer in Round 1, and now he's proposing a split that favors him in Round 2. I need to consider the inflation effect on Bob. While my money's value is the same as Round 1, Bob's $550,000 is now worth only $550,000 * 0.8 = $440,000 to him in Round 1 dollars. He is probably aware of this and made his proposal accordingly.

His proposal gives me $450,000. In the first round I offered him $450,000 so I could gain $550,000.
Now I need to think carefully. If I reject, I will need to propose next turn, knowing that Bob is being tough and that inflation is hurting him. Is it wise to push back? 
I should accept.
