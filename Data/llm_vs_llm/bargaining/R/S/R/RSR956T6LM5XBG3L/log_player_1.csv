"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me make a fair initial offer, considering that delay will cost me 20% due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because while an equal split might seem fair, I need to account for the 20% inflation penalty I'll suffer if we go to another round. This offer gives Bob a substantial portion while protecting my interests against potential delays."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept this offer, I get $500,000, but it's worth 20% less due to inflation, so effectively $400,000
- If I reject and make a new offer in round 3, any amount I get will be worth another 20% less
- My original offer of $550,000 would have been worth more than what I'm being offered now
- However, rejecting this offer means the next round will have even more severe inflation for me

Given that the inflation penalty is severe and compounds each round, I should accept this offer. Getting $400,000 in effective value now is better than risking further devaluation.
