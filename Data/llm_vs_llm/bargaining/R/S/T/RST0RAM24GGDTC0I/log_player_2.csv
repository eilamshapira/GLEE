"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first move. This is still a fair offer that gives you a substantial portion. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer...

While 40$ is a decent amount, there's no real justification for Alice to get a larger share just for making the first move. I believe a more equitable split would be fair, and I can propose that in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose an equal split, which is the most fair solution:

{
""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I propose we split this evenly 50-50. This is the fairest solution, and we can both walk away happy with a good amount.""
}"
