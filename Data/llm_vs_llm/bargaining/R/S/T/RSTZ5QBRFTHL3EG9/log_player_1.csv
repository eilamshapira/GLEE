"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair first offer, considering that inflation will reduce the value by 20% each round if we don't reach an agreement quickly.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose an equal split of $5,000 each. This is a fair starting point that respects both parties and has the best chance of being accepted immediately, before inflation starts eating into the value."
