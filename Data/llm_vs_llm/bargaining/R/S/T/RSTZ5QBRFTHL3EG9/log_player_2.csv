"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. It's a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
2. However, if I reject, I can make my own offer next round
3. Due to inflation, if I reject, any amount I get next round will be worth 10% less
4. If I get $5000 now, that's better than getting $5500 next round (which would only be worth $4950 to me)
5. There's also risk that Alice might reject my next offer

Given these factors, especially the inflation penalty, this fair split in the first round is actually a good deal for me.
