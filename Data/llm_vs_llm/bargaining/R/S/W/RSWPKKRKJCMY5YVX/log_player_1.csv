"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it more evenly. I propose 400000 for me and 600000 for you. It's a fair deal considering the value decrease for me each round. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
