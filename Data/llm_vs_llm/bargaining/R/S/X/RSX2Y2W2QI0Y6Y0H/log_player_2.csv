"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me 4000$ while taking 6000$ for herself. 

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 10% less to me and 20% less to Alice. So the total value will be:
- For me: 9000$ to divide
- For Alice: 8000$ to divide

Since Alice will lose value faster than me (20% vs 10% per round), I have some leverage in negotiations. I could potentially get a better deal by making a counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice will lose value faster than me, I'll propose a more balanced split, but still slightly in my favor. I'll also note that if Alice rejects, the next round will be worth even less to her.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering a 55%-45% split which is more equitable than her initial offer, while still giving me a slight advantage. This seems fair given that we both lose value over time, but she loses more, so she has more incentive to agree quickly."
