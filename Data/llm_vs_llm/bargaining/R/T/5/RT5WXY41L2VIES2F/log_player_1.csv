"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand. I will make the first offer.

Here's my offer in JSON format:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I see the offer and understand the impact of inflation on my potential gains.

My gains are now worth 20% less than in the first round. So, if I get $4000, its real value is $4000 * (1 - 0.20) = $3200.

Considering the time limit, and the fact that I don't know how inflation affects Bob, I will make my decision based on what I can actually keep now.

I choose to:

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's round 3. The money is worth even less now for me.

My offer is:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
