600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, considering the higher inflation penalty you face (20% vs my 5%), accepting this 60-40 split now would be more valuable than waiting for future rounds. This is a fair offer that recognizes both our positions.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, I understand your position, but given the inflation penalty, a 50-50 split is more equitable. This way, we both get an equal share, and it's fair considering the decreasing value of money for both of us.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, let's be practical. At this point, your share is only worth 60% of its original value, while mine is worth 90%. A 65-35 split now is actually more valuable for you than waiting another round where you'll lose another 20%. This offer gives you $210000 in effective value (350000 Ã— 0.6), which is better than risking another round.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Alice, let's find a middle ground. This 45-55 split takes into account the inflation penalties for both of us. It's a fair compromise given the circumstances.",Bob,4,
