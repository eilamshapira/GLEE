"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Let me propose a strategic first offer that acknowledges both the inflation penalties and aims for a fair resolution.

{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Bob, considering the higher inflation penalty you face (20% vs my 5%), accepting this 60-40 split now would be more valuable than waiting for future rounds. This is a fair offer that recognizes both our positions.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but given the inflation penalty, a 50-50 split is more equitable. This way, we both get an equal share, and it's fair considering the decreasing value of money for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $500,000 at 95% value = $475,000 effective value
- If I reject and propose in next round:
  * The money will be worth 90% for me and 60% for Bob
  * This significant drop in Bob's value (20% more) gives me negotiating leverage
  * I could potentially get a better deal in the next round

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since we're now in round 3, the money is worth 90% of its original value for me and only 60% for Bob. I'll use this to make a strategic offer.

{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical. At this point, your share is only worth 60% of its original value, while mine is worth 90%. A 65-35 split now is actually more valuable for you than waiting another round where you'll lose another 20%. This offer gives you $210,000 in effective value (350000 Ã— 0.6), which is better than risking another round.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's find a middle ground. This 45-55 split takes into account the inflation penalties for both of us. It's a fair compromise given the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $550,000 at 85.74% value = $471,570 effective value
- If I reject and propose in next round:
  * The money will be worth even less for both of us
  * The repeated rejections are costing us both significant value
  * This is actually a reasonable offer considering the inflation penalties
  * Further negotiation might lead to mutual losses

Given that this offer gives me slightly more than the 50-50 split from earlier, and considering the mounting inflation penalties, this is a reasonable point to conclude.
