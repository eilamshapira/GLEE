"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering the higher inflation penalty you face (20% vs my 5%), accepting this 60-40 split now would be more valuable than waiting for future rounds. This is a fair offer that recognizes both our positions. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but given the inflation penalty, a 50-50 split is more equitable. This way, we both get an equal share, and it's fair considering the decreasing value of money for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical. At this point, your share is only worth 60% of its original value, while mine is worth 90%. A 65-35 split now is actually more valuable for you than waiting another round where you'll lose another 20%. This offer gives you $210000 in effective value (350000 Ã— 0.6), which is better than risking another round. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000
