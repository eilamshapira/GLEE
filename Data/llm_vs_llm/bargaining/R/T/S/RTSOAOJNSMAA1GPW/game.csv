5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we split the $10000 equally – $5000 each. Since delaying the agreement costs me 5% per round, I believe locking in an even division now is in both our best interests. Let’s settle quickly and avoid unnecessary inflation losses. What do you say?",Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I believe I deserve a slightly larger share. Let's aim for $5500 for me and $4500 for you. This is still a good deal for both of us considering the inflation. What do you think?",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, I understand your reasoning. Accepting this deal now is better for me than risking further rounds with additional inflation losses. Let's finalize the agreement with $4500 for me (worth 5% less due to inflation) and $5500 for you.",Alice,2,accept
