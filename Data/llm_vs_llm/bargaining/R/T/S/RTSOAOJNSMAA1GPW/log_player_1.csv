"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split the $10,000 equally – $5,000 each. Since delaying the agreement costs me 5% per round, I believe locking in an even division now is in both our best interests. Let’s settle quickly and avoid unnecessary inflation losses. What do you say?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I believe I deserve a slightly larger share. Let's aim for $5500 for me and $4500 for you. This is still a good deal for both of us considering the inflation. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Bob, I understand your reasoning. Accepting this deal now is better for me than risking further rounds with additional inflation losses. Let's finalize the agreement with $4500 for me (worth 5% less due to inflation) and $5500 for you.""}"
