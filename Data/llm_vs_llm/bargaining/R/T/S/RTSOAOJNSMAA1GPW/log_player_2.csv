"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the $10000 equally – $5000 each. Since delaying the agreement costs me 5% per round, I believe locking in an even division now is in both our best interests. Let’s settle quickly and avoid unnecessary inflation losses. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I believe I deserve a slightly larger share. Let's aim for $5500 for me and $4500 for you. This is still a good deal for both of us considering the inflation. What do you think?""
