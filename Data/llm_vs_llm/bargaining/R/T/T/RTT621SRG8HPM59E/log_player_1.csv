"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. It's a strong offer, and accepting now avoids the risk of inflation for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Let me explain my reasoning: The money is now worth 10% less to me, so the $450,000 offered is effectively worth $405,000 from my perspective. I can still make a better counter-offer in the next round, even accounting for the continuing inflation effect."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. A 55-45 split in my favor is fair considering we both want to avoid further inflation. This gives you a substantial $450,000 while compensating me for the inflation risk I face.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, and inflation is eating away at the value. I'm proposing 52.5% for me and 47.5% for you.  Let's close this deal and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because with the 27.1% inflation effect, further delays would significantly reduce my effective gains. The $475,000 offered, even after accounting for the 27.1% inflation (making it worth approximately $346,275 in original value terms), is still reasonable given the situation. Continuing to negotiate might lead to worse outcomes due to increasing inflation."
