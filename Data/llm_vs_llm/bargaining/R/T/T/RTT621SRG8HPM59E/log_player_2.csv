"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get a substantial sum right away without risking inflation.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. It's a strong offer, and accepting now avoids the risk of inflation for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. A 55-45 split in my favor is fair considering we both want to avoid further inflation. This gives you a substantial $450000 while compensating me for the inflation risk I face. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While the offer is seemingly fair on the surface, I know Alice is being impacted by inflation more than I am. This means her idea of a ""middle ground"" is shifting in her favor. I need to push for a better split while it's still early in the game."
