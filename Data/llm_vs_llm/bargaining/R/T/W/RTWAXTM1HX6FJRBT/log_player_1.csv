"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a division that takes into account the different inflation rates affecting both players. Since Bob's money devalues faster (10% per round) compared to mine (5% per round), he has more incentive to accept a reasonable offer early.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this 60-40 split in my favor because:
1. Bob faces higher inflation risk (10% vs 5%)
2. If he rejects, his next offer would need to be compelling enough to overcome my smaller inflation penalty
3. It's still a substantial amount for Bob ($400,000) that should be attractive enough to accept rather than risk inflation"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept Bob's offer now:
   * I get $450,000 at 95% value = $427,500 effective value
   * Bob gets $550,000 at 90% value = $495,000 effective value

2. If I reject and make a new offer next round:
   * The money will be worth another 5% less for me (90% total)
   * The money will be worth another 10% less for Bob (80% total)
   * I'd need to make a very attractive offer to Bob to overcome his higher inflation

Given that:
1. The current offer gives me a substantial amount with only 5% depreciation
2. Rejecting would mean both of us lose more value
3. The split is fairly reasonable considering the circumstances
