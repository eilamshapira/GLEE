550000.0,450000.0,Let's make this fair and efficient. I'm offering you a generous 45% split to avoid lengthy negotiations that will reduce the money's value for both of us.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Given the rapid depreciation of the money's value, especially for you, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor this round. This is fair considering the inflation rates and gives us a quick resolution to benefit us both before the value drops further.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
525000.0,475000.0,"Let's be practical here. With my 20% inflation rate versus your 10%, we both lose by dragging this out. This 52.5-47.5 split is fair and considers both our positions. Further delays will only hurt us both more significantly.",Alice,3,
