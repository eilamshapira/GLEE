"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's make this fair and efficient. I'm offering you a generous 45% split to avoid lengthy negotiations that will reduce the money's value for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the rapid depreciation of the money's value, especially for you, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor this round. This is fair considering the inflation rates and gives us a quick resolution to benefit us both before the value drops further. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The inflation rates mean I should act quickly, but Bob's offer gives him too much advantage. I'll make a more balanced counter-offer in the next round, considering our different inflation rates."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Let's be practical here. With my 20% inflation rate versus your 10%, we both lose by dragging this out. This 52.5-47.5 split is fair and considers both our positions. Further delays will only hurt us both more significantly.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the rapid depreciation, especially on your side, I suggest a 52.5-47.5 split in my favor. This proposal reflects the urgency to settle before the value diminishes further, and it's a fair compromise given our inflation rates. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because with my higher inflation rate (48.8% loss already), continuing to negotiate would significantly reduce the real value of any future gains. While Bob's offer gives him a slight advantage, the remaining value of my share now is better than risking further depreciation through more rounds of negotiation."
