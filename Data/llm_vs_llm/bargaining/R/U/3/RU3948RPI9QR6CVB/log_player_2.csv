Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be practical here. With my 20% inflation rate versus your 10%, we both lose by dragging this out. This 52.5-47.5 split is fair and considers both our positions. Further delays will only hurt us both more significantly.
