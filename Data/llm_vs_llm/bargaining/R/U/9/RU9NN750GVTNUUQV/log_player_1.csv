I'm starting to get concerned about Bob's unwillingness to compromise, but I still believe holding out for a better deal is the right move. The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me, but it's better to get something than nothing."

It's getting very risky now, but I still think there's a chance Bob will offer a fairer deal. Accepting $1 would be a disaster at this point."

This is a terrible outcome, but I have no choice. If I reject this offer, we both get nothing.  Bob played very aggressively and took advantage of my rapidly devaluing returns."
