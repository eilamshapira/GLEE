60.0,40.0,I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to avoid the 5% inflation penalty from further rounds.,Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Considering the 5% inflation penalty, I'm offering a more balanced split. It's in both our interests to agree sooner rather than later.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Let's be efficient and end this now. With the current 10% inflation penalty on my end, this 55-45 split is actually costing me more than it appears. If we continue, we both lose more value.",Alice,3,
