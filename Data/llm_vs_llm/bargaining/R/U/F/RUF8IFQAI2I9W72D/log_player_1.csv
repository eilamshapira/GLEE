"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the 5% inflation penalty, I'm offering a more balanced split. It's in both our interests to agree sooner rather than later. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer since even with the 5% inflation penalty, I can still propose a better deal for myself in the next round. The current offer would give me $45, but with 5% inflation penalty, that's worth about $42.75 to me. I believe I can secure a better outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55,
