4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, let's be practical. I'm offering you a sizable portion to make it worth settling now. This is a good deal before inflation eats away at the value.",Bob,2,

5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for something more equitable. Since we're now in round 3 with 40% total inflation if we don't agree, I'm offering you $4800 while I take $5200. This slight advantage to me balances your previous attempt to take more, while still giving you a good amount. Let's settle now before inflation reduces our total value further.",Alice,3,
