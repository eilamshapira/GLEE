Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a fair offer to Bob while considering the inflation penalty for prolonged negotiation.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be practical. I'm offering you a sizable portion to make it worth settling now. This is a good deal before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for something more equitable. Since we're now in round 3 with 40% total inflation if we don't agree, I'm offering you $4800 while I take $5200. This slight advantage to me balances your previous attempt to take more, while still giving you a good amount. Let's settle now before inflation reduces our total value further.""}"
