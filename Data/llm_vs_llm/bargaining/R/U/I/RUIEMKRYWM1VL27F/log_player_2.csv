"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing an equal split of the money. This is fair to both of us, and we can avoid losing value to inflation by settling now. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be practical. I'm offering you a sizable portion to make it worth settling now. This is a good deal before inflation eats away at the value.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for something more equitable. Since we're now in round 3 with 40% total inflation if we don't agree, I'm offering you $4800 while I take $5200. This slight advantage to me balances your previous attempt to take more, while still giving you a good amount. Let's settle now before inflation reduces our total value further. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
