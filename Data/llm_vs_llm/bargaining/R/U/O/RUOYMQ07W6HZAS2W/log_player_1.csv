Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I suggest a fair split where I get slightly more as the first mover, but you still receive a substantial amount. Better to agree now than lose value to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the amount equally and avoid further inflation. It's a fair deal, and we both benefit equally from it. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer for an equal split. This is a fair proposal, and with the 5% inflation penalty already affecting this round, it's better to secure the deal now rather than risk further devaluation in subsequent rounds. A 50-50 split of $1,000,000 gives us each $500,000, which is a reasonable outcome for both parties."
