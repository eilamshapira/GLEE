"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that Alice is offering me $40 out of $100, I need to consider whether it's better to accept now or reject and make a counter-offer next round.

If I reject, the total value will decrease by 5% due to inflation (for me), meaning the $100 would be worth $95 in the next round. If I were to propose a 50/50 split then, I'd get $47.50, which is better than the $40 offered now.

However, Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation. Also, I don't know how inflation affects Alice's valuation, which could influence her decisions.

Since $40 is a reasonable offer (40% of the total) and pursuing a higher amount carries risk of ending with less due to inflation in later rounds, I'll make my decision.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair division that's slightly in my favor but should still be attractive to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'm offering a 55/45 split in my favor. This is a reasonable counteroffer that gives me more than Alice's initial proposal while still giving her a substantial portion. Since we both face the risk of further inflation if negotiations continue to another round, this balanced offer should appeal to Alice's interest in reaching an agreement efficiently."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice has increased her offer from $40 to $45, which is a positive movement. Due to 9.75% inflation for me, the current $100 pot is effectively worth about $90.25 from my perspective.

If I reject this offer and we move to round 4, inflation would increase to approximately 14.76% (compounding 5% three times), making the pot worth even less to me. If I were to propose a better split in the next round, there's no guarantee Alice would accept it, risking further rounds of inflation.

Alice's current offer of $45 gives me more than I would have received in her first offer ($40), and when adjusted for current inflation, it's a reasonable proposition compared to the risk of continuing.
