44.0,56.0,"Alice, every round we wait further shrinks the pie. At this stage, your 44 dollars is worth about 22.53 in round‐1 value—a bit more than you'd expect if you delayed to the next round. I believe this is a fair, final offer that spares both of us additional loss. Let's settle now before the pie gets any smaller.",Bob,4,
