"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a slightly favorable split for myself since I'm making the first offer, but keep it reasonable to increase chances of acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose to take $55 and give $45 to Bob. This is a fair offer considering I'm making the first move, while still giving Bob a substantial portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept Bob's offer:
   * I get $40, but with 5% inflation = $38 real value
   * Bob gets $60, but with 20% inflation = $48 real value

2. If I reject:
   * Next round will have even more inflation (10% for me)
   * I'll get to make the offer, but the total value will be lower
   * There's risk of further rejections and more value loss

While $40 is less than I hoped for, considering:
- The inflation effect
- The risk of further devaluation in future rounds
- That I'm still getting a reasonable amount in real terms ($38)
- That waiting another round will definitely reduce the total value
