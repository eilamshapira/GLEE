"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $40 while she gets $60.

While it's not an equal split, $40 is still a significant portion of the $100. Since there's no inflation penalty for me, I don't lose anything by continuing to the next round, but I also don't gain anything. However, Alice might have inflation pressure on her side that I don't know about.

I think I can get a better deal by making a counter-proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a more equitable split, but still keeping it reasonable to increase chances of acceptance.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

This is a fair, equal split of the money. Since I know I don't face any inflation pressure, but Alice might, she should be incentivized to accept this balanced offer rather than risk losing value in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has improved her offer from the initial 40/60 split to a 45/55 split
2. I now know that Alice is facing significant inflation pressure (36% less value for her)
3. I'm not affected by inflation at all
4. If I reject, Alice's next proposal would be worth even less to her due to inflation

Given that:
- The offer is more favorable than her first one
- Alice is under pressure from significant inflation
- I could wait for an even better offer, but the difference might not be worth prolonging the game
- 45% is a reasonably fair portion

I'll accept this offer.
