0.0,100.0,"Hi Bob, here's my offer: you get the entire $100 and I take nothing. I understand that if you reject and make your proposal in the next round you would still secure the full amount—so to keep things efficient (and to avoid further loss on my side due to depreciation), I’m offering you $100 right now. Looking forward to your acceptance!",Alice,1,
