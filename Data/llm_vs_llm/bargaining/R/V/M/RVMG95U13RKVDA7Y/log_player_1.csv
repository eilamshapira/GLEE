Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm offering Bob $10,000, keeping the vast majority for myself.  I figure it's a small amount for him, but better than nothing.  Let's see if he's greedy!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's not ideal, but better than risking getting nothing in later rounds.  Let's take the 500,000 and call it a day."
