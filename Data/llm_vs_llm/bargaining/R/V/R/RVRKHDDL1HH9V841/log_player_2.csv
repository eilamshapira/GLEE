"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer and consider the impact of inflation.

Alice is offering an even split of the $10,000, with each of us getting $5,000.

If I reject this offer, we'll go to Round 2 where:
- I can make a counter-offer
- For me, the money will be worth 20% less (so the $10,000 pot is effectively worth $8,000 to me)
- For Alice, the money will be worth only 5% less (so the $10,000 pot is worth $9,500 to her)

This difference in inflation rates means delaying is much more costly for me than for Alice. If I reject now, the maximum I could get in the next round would be $8,000 (since that's what the full amount would be worth to me), and Alice would likely reject any offer that gives her less than $4,750 (since $5,000 with 5% inflation is $4,750).

A 50-50 split is fair, and rejecting would put me at a disadvantage due to the asymmetric inflation rates.
