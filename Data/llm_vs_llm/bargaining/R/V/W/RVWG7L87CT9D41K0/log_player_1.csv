"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split that takes into account the potential loss from inflation if Bob rejects.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because:
1. It's relatively fair, giving me a modest advantage
2. If Bob rejects, the next round will have the money worth 5% less to me
3. A 55-45 split is reasonable enough that Bob should seriously consider accepting rather than moving to the next round"
