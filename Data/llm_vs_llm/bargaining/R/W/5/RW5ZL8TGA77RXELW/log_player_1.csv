"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split while considering that inflation will reduce the value in future rounds if Bob declines.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this division because while a 50-50 split might seem fairest, I need to account for the 5% inflation penalty I'll suffer if we go to the next round. By asking for 55%, I'm offering Bob a substantial sum while protecting myself from potential inflation losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept now:
   * I get $450,000 worth 95% of original value = $427,500 effective value
   * Bob gets $550,000 worth 90% of original value

2. If I reject and propose in next round:
   * Money will be worth even less (90% for me)
   * I might be able to negotiate a better split, but the inflation penalty makes this risky
   * Even if I get a larger share next round, it might be worth less due to inflation

Given that $427,500 is still a substantial amount and the risk of further value erosion, I'll accept this offer.
