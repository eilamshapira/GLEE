"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $40 out of the $100, while she takes $60. 

If I reject this offer, I'll get to make a counter-offer next round, but due to inflation, the money will be worth 20% less to me. That means the total value to me would be equivalent to only $80 in current value, and my potential share would need to account for that reduction.

Since $40 right now is better than a potential portion of an effectively reduced $80 in the next round, I'll accept this offer.
