"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40. It's a fair deal for a quick agreement. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer gives me $40
2. If I reject and propose next round:
   * Money is worth 10% less
   * Maximum I could get would be $90, but worth only $81 due to inflation
   * Alice might reject my offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation

While 40/60 split isn't exactly equal, it's a reasonable offer considering:
- I avoid inflation loss
- I get a guaranteed amount
- Further negotiation might lead to worse outcomes if Alice is stubborn
