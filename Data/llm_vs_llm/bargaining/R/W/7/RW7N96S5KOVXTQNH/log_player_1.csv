"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I suggest a more balanced 60/40 split. This is much fairer than your initial proposal, and considering inflation will affect future rounds, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
