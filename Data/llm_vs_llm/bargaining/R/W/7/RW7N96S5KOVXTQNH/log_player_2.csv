"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  This is a fair starting point, considering I'm taking the initiative. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The offer of only $10 is too low. With inflation reducing the value by 20% each round, I can still make a more favorable counter-proposal in the next round that would be better for both parties."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I suggest a more balanced 60/40 split. This is much fairer than your initial proposal, and considering inflation will affect future rounds, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 60/40 is still too far in your favor.  Let's meet in the middle at 70/30. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. Due to inflation already reducing my gains by 36%, if I wait longer, my share will be worth even less. A $30 share now (worth approximately $19.20 after the 36% inflation) is better than risking further rounds where inflation will continue to erode my gains. Additionally, Alice has moved significantly from her initial 90/10 offer, making this a reasonable compromise."
