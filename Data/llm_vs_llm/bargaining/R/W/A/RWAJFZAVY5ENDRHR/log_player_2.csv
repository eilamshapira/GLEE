"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'd like to see your counter-proposal. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but considering the inflation rates affecting us differently, I think a more equitable split would be for me to take 5500 and you take 4500. This way, we both get a fair share considering the devaluation of the money over rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Considering the inflation rates, I think this split is more fair. Let's settle on this to avoid further devaluation of the money.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly.  The inflation is impacting both of us, and this is a fair compromise to avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
