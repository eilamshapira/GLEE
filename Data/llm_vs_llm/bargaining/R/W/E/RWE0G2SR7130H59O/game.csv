450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. This is fair because my inflation rate (20%) is actually double yours (10%), meaning I lose more value with each passing round. This split acknowledges our different positions while still giving you a substantial amount. Let's conclude this now so we both avoid further devaluation.",Bob,2,
