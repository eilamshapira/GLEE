Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. This is fair because my inflation rate (20%) is actually double yours (10%), meaning I lose more value with each passing round. This split acknowledges our different positions while still giving you a substantial amount. Let's conclude this now so we both avoid further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
