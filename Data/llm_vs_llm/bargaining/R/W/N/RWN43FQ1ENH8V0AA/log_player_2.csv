"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer. She's proposing:
* I get $4,000
* She gets $6,000

This is a 40/60 split, which isn't particularly favorable to me. Given that:
1. We have 11 more rounds available
2. I'll be able to make the next proposal if I reject
3. The 5% inflation penalty per round isn't too severe for the first few rounds

I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer, but still giving Alice a decent portion to increase chances of acceptance:

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

This represents a 55/45 split which is fairer than the previous offer, while still giving Alice a significant portion. The slight tilt in my favor is justified since I'm affected by inflation while she isn't."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze Alice's new offer:
* I get $4,200, but with 9.75% inflation, it's actually worth $3,790.50
* She gets $5,800 (no inflation for her)

Alice has slightly improved her offer from the first round ($4,000 â†’ $4,200), but due to inflation, I'm actually getting less real value than in her first offer. We still have 9 rounds left, but the inflation penalty is starting to become more significant.

Still, I believe I can get a better deal, and the next round would be my turn to propose again.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice has rejected my previous 55/45 split and time is becoming more critical due to inflation, I'll make a slightly more attractive offer to her while still maintaining a fair share for myself:

{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800}

This 52/48 split is more balanced than previous offers and should be more appealing to Alice. Given that I'm affected by inflation and she isn't, this still protects my interests while showing willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze Alice's latest offer:
* I get $4,400, but with 18.55% inflation, it's actually worth $3,583.80
* She gets $5,600 (no inflation for her)

I notice that:
1. The inflation is becoming quite significant (18.55%)
2. We're approaching the halfway point of our rounds (5/12)
3. Alice keeps making small improvements to her offers, but they're not keeping pace with inflation
4. My real value is actually decreasing with each of her offers due to inflation

While I'd like a better deal, the inflation is becoming a serious concern. If this continues much longer, even a larger nominal amount will be worth less to me. It's time to accept.
