"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a reasonable first offer, considering that I need to account for potential inflation if negotiations extend further.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this 60-40 split because I'm facing a 5% inflation penalty per round, and I need to protect myself against that risk while still making an offer that Bob might find acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I'll get $400,000 with 5% inflation = $380,000 effective value
- If I reject, any future gains will be worth another 5% less
- Bob seems to be facing higher inflation (20%) which gives me some negotiating leverage
- We still have 10 rounds left, but the value keeps decreasing
- Bob's counteroffer is quite aggressive, moving from my 60-40 split to a 40-60 split in his favor

Given that I still have many rounds to negotiate and Bob is facing higher inflation pressure than me (20% vs 5%), I believe I can get a better deal by continuing negotiations.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob is facing much higher inflation (20% vs my 5% per round), I can be a bit more strategic. However, I also need to make progress towards an agreement to avoid losing everything after 12 rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm moderating my position from my initial 60-40 split to a 55-45 split. This is a more balanced offer that:
1. Still gives me the larger share to protect against inflation
2. Shows willingness to compromise from my initial position
3. Takes advantage of Bob's higher inflation pressure which should make him more eager to reach a deal"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I'll get $450,000 with 14.26% inflation = $386,330 effective value
- Bob's proposal has improved from his last offer (moving from 400k to 450k for me)
- Bob is facing severe inflation (48.8% now), which explains why he's becoming more reasonable
- My own inflation isn't too severe yet (14.26%)
- We're in round 4 of 12, still have time but need to be cautious

While I could try to negotiate further, Bob is showing movement in my direction, and his high inflation rate suggests he'll be motivated to close soon. However, given that his inflation is so much higher than mine (48.8% vs 14.26%), I think I can still get a better deal by continuing negotiations.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that Bob is facing severe inflation (48.8% last round) compared to my 14.26%, and he showed movement toward a more balanced split, I'll make a slightly more aggressive offer but still show some room for negotiation.

{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000}

I'm offering a 52.5-47.5 split because:
1. Bob's severe inflation pressure should make him more willing to accept
2. This is more favorable to Bob than my previous offers (moving from 55-45 to 52.5-47.5)
3. It's still good for me given my lower inflation rate
4. We're approaching the middle of our 12 rounds, so we need to start converging on an agreement"
