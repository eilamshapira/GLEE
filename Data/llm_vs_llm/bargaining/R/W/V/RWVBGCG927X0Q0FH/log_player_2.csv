"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, here's my proposal: $55 for me and $45 for you. I think it's a fair split given I'm going first. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice offers me $45 out of $100
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 10% inflation, any amount in the next round will be worth 10% less to me
4. If I wait, $45 now would be equivalent to $50 in the next round
5. Considering the inflation risk and that the offer is relatively fair, accepting might be the better choice
