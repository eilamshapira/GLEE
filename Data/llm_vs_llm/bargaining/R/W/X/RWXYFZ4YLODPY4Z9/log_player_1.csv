"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a fair offer to Bob in this first round, recognizing that inflation affects him more than me.

{""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, since you face 10% inflation per round and I don't, it makes sense to agree quickly. I'm offering you a substantial portion that's worth more now than it would be in future rounds.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe a fair split is 50/50. Given the inflation affecting my share, this is a reasonable proposal for both of us. Let's settle on this and end the game. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
