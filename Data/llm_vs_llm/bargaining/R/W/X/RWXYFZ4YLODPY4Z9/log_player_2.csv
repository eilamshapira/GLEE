"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, since you face 10% inflation per round and I don't, it makes sense to agree quickly. I'm offering you a substantial portion that's worth more now than it would be in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
