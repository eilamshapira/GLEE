"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me propose a fair split, considering the inflation rates and the need to reach an agreement quickly.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor because I face a higher inflation rate (20% vs 10%), so I need a larger share to compensate for the potential value loss if negotiations extend to further rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 20% inflation for me, $450,000 is now worth $360,000 in round 1 terms.
For Bob, $550,000 with 10% inflation is worth $495,000 in round 1 terms.

If I reject and we go to round 3, any amount will be worth even less due to higher inflation (40% for me, 30% for Bob).
My previous offer of $600,000 would only be worth $360,000 to me in round 3.

Given these calculations, and the risk of further value loss, I should accept this offer now.
