"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's proposal. She's offering me $400,000 and taking $600,000 for herself. 

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value decreases by 10% for me (meaning the $1,000,000 is worth $900,000 to me), and by 20% for Alice (meaning it's worth $800,000 to her).

I could potentially propose a better split for myself in the next round, but I need to weigh that against the 10% depreciation. Since Alice stands to lose more from inflation (20% vs my 10%), I have some negotiating advantage if we go to the next round.

Let me reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that takes advantage of the differential inflation rates while still being reasonable enough for Alice to accept.

Since Alice faces a 20% depreciation per round compared to my 10%, she has more incentive to reach an agreement quickly. If we go to round 3, the $1,000,000 will only be worth $800,000 to her, while it will be worth $900,000 to me.

I'll propose a more balanced split, giving myself a slight advantage:

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000}

This is fair because if Alice rejects this offer, she'll face a greater loss in the next round than I would. Still, I'm offering her a substantial amount that would be rational for her to accept given the depreciation rates."
