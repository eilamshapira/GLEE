"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think through this:
1. Alice offered a 50-50 split, which is fair at face value
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 20% less next round
3. I could propose something better for me next round, but Alice might reject
4. A 50-50 split in hand is better than risking future rounds with inflation

The offer is fair and avoiding inflation is important, so I'll accept.
