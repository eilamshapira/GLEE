"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think a 50-50 split is the most fair division. This way we both receive $5000 each. The previous offer wasn't balanced, and I'd prefer an equal split that benefits us both equally. Please accept this fair proposal. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
