"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly. I hope you agree! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice's offer gives me $4000 and her $6000, which isn't an even split, I need to consider the 5% inflation penalty I'll face if I reject and move to the next round. If I reject, the total value will be worth 5% less to me, meaning the $10,000 would effectively be worth $9,500 to me in the next round.

A fair 50-50 split would give me $5,000, but rejecting now means I'd need to secure at least $4,211 ($4,000 รท 0.95) in the next round just to break even with Alice's current offer.

Given the inflation penalty and uncertainty about how inflation affects Alice, I'll reject this offer and make my own proposal in the next round.
