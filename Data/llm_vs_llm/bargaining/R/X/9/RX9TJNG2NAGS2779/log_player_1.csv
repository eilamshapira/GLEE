"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Let me make a strategic first offer, considering the 20% depreciation per round for me but not for Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""I'm offering you a fair 40% share. Remember that while the money devalues for me each round, it doesn't for you. A quick agreement benefits us both.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking into account the devaluation for you. This offer gives you more than half of the current value. Let's settle before it's too late. 
# Alice gain: 575000 
# Bob gain: 425000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $575,000, but it's worth 20% less due to inflation, so effectively $460,000
- If I reject, the next round will have another 20% devaluation for me
- Bob's offer is reasonable considering the inflation factor, and gives me a good portion
- Prolonging negotiations could significantly reduce my effective gains
