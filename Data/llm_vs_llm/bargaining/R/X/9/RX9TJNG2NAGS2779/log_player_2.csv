"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you a fair 40% share. Remember that while the money devalues for me each round, it doesn't for you. A quick agreement benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money doesn't devalue for me, I have an advantage in waiting. However, I also need to consider that if we don't reach an agreement, we'll both get nothing. Given that Alice's offer is not extremely unfair, I might be inclined to accept to ensure I get something. But, I think I can get a better deal if I wait.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Now it's my turn to make an offer. Considering the money devalues for Alice by 20% each round, I'll try to take advantage of this. However, I also want to make sure my offer is reasonable enough for her to consider accepting.

Since the total amount is $1,000,000 and it's the second round, the value for Alice has decreased by 20%. So, the value for Alice is now $1,000,000 * 0.8 = $800,000.

I'll offer her a bit more than a 50% share of the devalued amount to make it attractive.
