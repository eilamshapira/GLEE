"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $5500 and you receive $4500. This division reflects both our interests fairly and avoids any potential losses from delay. I believe this is a strong start for both of usâ€”what do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $4500 for me
2. If I reject and move to next round:
   * Money will be worth 20% less to me
   * Maximum I could propose would be $10000, but worth only $8000 to me due to inflation
   * Alice might reject my proposal, leading to further rounds and more inflation

The current offer of $4500 is quite reasonable, especially considering:
- It's close to a 50-50 split
- I avoid the 20% inflation penalty
- There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in future rounds
- Alice might be more aggressive in later rounds
