"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it equally. It's fair and we both get a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Let's wait for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I need a bit more to compensate for the inflation I'm experiencing. You still get a fair amount.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concern about inflation, but I need to look out for my interests too. This offer still gives you a fair amount considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

While the amount of money is less than the original offer due to inflation, 45 is better than 40.5. If I were to reject and make a counteroffer, Alice would likely reject my counteroffer."
