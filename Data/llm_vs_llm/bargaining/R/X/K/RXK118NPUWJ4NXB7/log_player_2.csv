"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze this offer, taking inflation into account. This is Round 1, so there's no inflation penalty yet. Alice proposes I get $4000 and she gets $6000.

My goal is to maximize the amount I receive, considering the possibility of future rounds and the resulting inflation. Right now, $4000 seems reasonable, considering it's 40% of the total.
