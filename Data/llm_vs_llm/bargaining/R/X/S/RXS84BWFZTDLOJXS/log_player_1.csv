"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split while accounting for the risk of inflation if Bob declines.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose this division because if Bob declines and we go to the next round, the money will be worth 5% less to me. A 55-45 split gives Bob a good incentive to accept while protecting my interests against inflation risk."
