"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. Alice is proposing I get $45 out of the $100, while she gets $55. 

If I reject this offer, I'll make a counter-offer in the next round, but the money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation. This means the $100 would effectively be worth only $80 to me in the next round. Even if I asked for a larger share then, the inflation effect reduces my potential gain.

Since $45 now is better than a potential but uncertain higher amount that would be subject to a 20% reduction, this is a reasonable offer.
