"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer that considers the inflation effect while trying to create a fair division.

{""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a 55/45 split in my favor. This is fair considering I face 5% inflation each round, which means waiting would cost me value. If we don't agree now, we both lose money to inflation. This is a balanced first offer.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose a 50/50 split. This way, we both get an equal amount, and it avoids further losses due to inflation. Let's agree on this and finish the game. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
