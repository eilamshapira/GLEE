"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering a 55/45 split in my favor. This is fair considering I face 5% inflation each round, which means waiting would cost me value. If we don't agree now, we both lose money to inflation. This is a balanced first offer. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
