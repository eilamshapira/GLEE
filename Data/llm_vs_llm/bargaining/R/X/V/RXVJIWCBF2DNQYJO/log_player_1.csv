"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","For the first round, I'll make a reasonable offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, I want to make a deal quickly. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

This offer gives me a slight advantage, but it's still a fair split, considering the inflation penalty. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation penalty, the $4000 I'd gain is actually worth $4000 * 0.8 = $3200 to me.

Considering this, Bob's offer doesn't seem very favorable. I think I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth even less to me now (20% less with each round), I'll try to make a more attractive offer to Bob while still getting a decent share.

The total value of the money has decreased due to inflation:
- For me, it's 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 of the original value
- For Bob, it's 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 of the original value

My offer:
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

This split gives us equal shares, taking into account the decreasing value of the money. Hopefully, Bob will find this more acceptable!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of the offer considering the inflation:

The money I'd gain ($4500) is worth $4500 * 0.8^3 = $4500 * 0.512 = $2304 to me.

The money Bob would gain ($5500) is worth $5500 * 0.9^3 = $5500 * 0.729 = $4010 to him.

While the offer is more favorable to me than the previous one, I still think I can negotiate a better split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation penalties:

- For me, the money is now worth 0.8^4 = 0.4096 of the original value
- For Bob, the money is now worth 0.9^4 = 0.6561 of the original value

I'll try to make a more appealing offer to Bob, while still getting a decent share for myself.

My offer:
{""alice_gain"": 4200, ""bob_gain"": 5800}

This offer gives Bob a slightly larger share, which should be more attractive to him given the relatively lower inflation penalty he's facing. Hopefully, he'll accept this one!"
