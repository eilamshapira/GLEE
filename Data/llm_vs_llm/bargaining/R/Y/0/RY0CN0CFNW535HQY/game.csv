4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, I believe a more equitable split would be better for both of us. I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, which is much more balanced than your initial offer. Remember that with inflation, if you reject this, the total value decreases by 5% for me in the next round, and we'd both lose value. This is a fair compromise that gives us both a substantial amount.",Bob,2,
