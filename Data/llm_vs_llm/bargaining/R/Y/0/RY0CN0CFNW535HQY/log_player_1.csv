"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I believe a more equitable split would be better for both of us. I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, which is much more balanced than your initial offer. Remember that with inflation, if you reject this, the total value decreases by 5% for me in the next round, and we'd both lose value. This is a fair compromise that gives us both a substantial amount. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
