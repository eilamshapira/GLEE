"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Here's a fair division considering we both get a significant amount. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $2,000 while she gets $8,000, which is a 20-80 split. With inflation reducing the value by 5% each round, if I reject this offer, the total amount will effectively be worth less in the next round.

However, this split seems quite uneven. If I reject, I can make my own proposal in the next round and potentially get a larger share, even accounting for the 5% inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer that accounts for the inflation factor.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, I believe a more equitable split would be better for both of us. I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, which is much more balanced than your initial offer. Remember that with inflation, if you reject this, the total value decreases by 5% for me in the next round, and we'd both lose value. This is a fair compromise that gives us both a substantial amount.""}"
