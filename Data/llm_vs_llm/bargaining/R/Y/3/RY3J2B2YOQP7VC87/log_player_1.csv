"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering the time pressure and inflation risk we both face. Let's settle this quickly to maximize value for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose a 50-50 split. This way, we both share the risk of inflation equally and still receive a decent amount. Let's agree on this! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
* Bob's offering me $5000, but with 5% inflation, it's actually worth $4750 to me
* Waiting another round means any amount I get will be worth another 5% less
* We still have 10 rounds left, but the value keeps decreasing
* A 50-50 split is objectively fair
* Getting a deal now is better than risking further value loss
