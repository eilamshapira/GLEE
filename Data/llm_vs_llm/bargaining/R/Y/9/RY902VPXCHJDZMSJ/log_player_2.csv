"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which is $50 for me and $50 for her. This is a fair split of the total amount.

I need to consider the inflation factor. If I reject this offer, the total value decreases by 5% for me in each subsequent round. If I make a counter-offer in round 2, the $100 will actually be worth $95 to me. And if negotiations continue, the value will keep decreasing.

Given the fair nature of this initial offer and the risk of inflation, I'll accept.
