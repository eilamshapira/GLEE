5200.0,4800.0,"Alice, I value your commitment to fairness. However, delaying further reduces my share's real value by 5% per round. To avoid unnecessary losses for both of us, I propose we agree now on a split of 4800 for me and 5200 for you. I believe this maintains fairness while accounting for the time factor. Looking forward to your acceptance.",Bob,2,
