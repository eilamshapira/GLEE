"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I value your commitment to fairness. However, delaying further reduces my share's real value by 5% per round. To avoid unnecessary losses for both of us, I propose we agree now on a split of 4800 for me and 5200 for you. I believe this maintains fairness while accounting for the time factor. Looking forward to your acceptance. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
