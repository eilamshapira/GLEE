"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Alice, I value your commitment to fairness. However, delaying further reduces my share's real value by 5% per round. To avoid unnecessary losses for both of us, I propose we agree now on a split of 4800 for me and 5200 for you. I believe this maintains fairness while accounting for the time factor. Looking forward to your acceptance.""}"
