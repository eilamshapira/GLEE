"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer of $45 for me and $55 for her. With inflation reducing the value by 10% each round, if I reject now, the total amount will be worth less next round. If I make a counter-offer, there's no guarantee Alice will accept it.

$45 now is better than potentially less in future rounds due to inflation. This is close to an even split, and the difference isn't worth the risk of further negotiation with decreasing value.
