550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob! Since I face a 10% inflation penalty each round, I'm proposing a fair split that accounts for this. If we delay to round 2, my share would be worth 10% less, so this 55/45 split makes us both better off than waiting.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Alice! I'm proposing a 50/50 split. This way, we both get an equal share, and it's better than risking future rounds. Let's settle this and both walk away with a fair amount!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, I have to reject a 50/50 split because of the 10% inflation I face each round. My $500K in round 2 is only worth $450K to me due to the 20% cumulative inflation I now face. This 60/40 split accounts for this disadvantage while still giving you a substantial amount. If we continue to delay, I'll need an even larger share to offset my inflation penalty.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Alice! I'm offering you $450000 and keeping $550000 for myself. I understand your concerns about inflation, but I'm still providing you with a substantial amount. It's better than risking another round!",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, due to compounding inflation, I'm now facing a 34.39% loss in value compared to round 1. Your $450K offer would only be worth about $328K to me in real value. This 65/35 split accounts for my significant disadvantage while still giving you a substantial $350K with no inflation penalty. If we keep going back and forth, I'll need increasingly larger portions to offset my growing inflation handicap. Let's be fair and resolve this now.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Hi Alice! I'm proposing a split where I take $600000 and you take $400000. While I recognize the inflation impact on your share, this is a solid amount for both of us compared to risking further rounds. Let's settle this!",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
700000.0,300000.0,"Bob, I've had to reject your offer because with 40.95% cumulative inflation, your $400K offer is only worth about $236K to me in real value. We're now at round 7 with a 46.86% inflation penalty for me. This 70/30 split accounts for this severe disadvantage. Mathematically, $700K with nearly 47% inflation gives me approximately $372K in real value - still much less than your $300K with no penalty. If we continue, my required share will need to be even larger to be fair. Let's end this now.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"Hi Alice! I'm offering you a split of $350000 and keeping $650000 for myself. I understand the inflation is significant on your side, but I believe this is still a fair division. It's better than risking another round!",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
750000.0,250000.0,"Bob, your last offer of $350K to me is only worth about $167K in real value to me due to the 52.17% inflation I now face. We're at round 9, where I'm facing a cumulative 56.95% inflation. This means even with this 75/25 split, my $750K is only worth about $323K to me in real value - still not much more than your $250K with no penalty. The math clearly shows how severely disadvantaged I am. If we go to round 11 or 12, we risk getting nothing. Let's conclude this now with a fair adjustment for the large inflation penalty.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"Hi Alice! I'm proposing a split where I take $700000 and you take $300000. I know you're dealing with significant inflation, but I believe this is still a substantial amount for you. It's better than the risk of getting nothing if we continue to delay!",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
800000.0,200000.0,"Bob, we have only one more round after this before we both get nothing. Your $300K offer is only worth $116K to me in real value due to the 61.26% inflation I face. At round 11, I'm now facing 65.13% inflation. Even with this 80/20 split, my $800K is only worth about $279K to me in real value - still only slightly more than your $200K. If we don't agree now, we'll likely both get zero in round 12. This is your last realistic chance to walk away with $200K instead of nothing.",Alice,11,
