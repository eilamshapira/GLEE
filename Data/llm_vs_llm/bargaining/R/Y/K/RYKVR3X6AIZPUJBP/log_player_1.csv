Mathematically, $700K with nearly 47% inflation gives me approximately $372K in real value - still much less than your $300K with no penalty.

This means even with this 75/25 split, my $750K is only worth about $323K to me in real value - still not much more than your $250K with no penalty. The math clearly shows how severely disadvantaged I am. If we go to round 11 or 12, we risk getting nothing. Let's conclude this now with a fair adjustment for the large inflation penalty.""}"
