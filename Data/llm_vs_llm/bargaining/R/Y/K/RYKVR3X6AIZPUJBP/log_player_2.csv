"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Since I face a 10% inflation penalty each round, I'm proposing a fair split that accounts for this. If we delay to round 2, my share would be worth 10% less, so this 55/45 split makes us both better off than waiting.

# Alice gain: 550000

Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have to reject a 50/50 split because of the 10% inflation I face each round. My $500K in round 2 is only worth $450K to me due to the 20% cumulative inflation I now face. This 60/40 split accounts for this disadvantage while still giving you a substantial amount. If we continue to delay, I'll need an even larger share to offset my inflation penalty. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, due to compounding inflation, I'm now facing a 34.39% loss in value compared to round 1. Your $450K offer would only be worth about $328K to me in real value. This 65/35 split accounts for my significant disadvantage while still giving you a substantial $350K with no inflation penalty. If we keep going back and forth, I'll need increasingly larger portions to offset my growing inflation handicap. Let's be fair and resolve this now. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I've had to reject your offer because with 40.95% cumulative inflation, your $400K offer is only worth about $236K to me in real value. We're now at round 7 with a 46.86% inflation penalty for me. This 70/30 split accounts for this severe disadvantage. Mathematically, $700K with nearly 47% inflation gives me approximately $372K in real value - still much less than your $300K with no penalty. If we continue, my required share will need to be even larger to be fair. Let's end this now. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000

I'm offering you a split of $350,000 and keeping $650,000 for myself. I understand the inflation is significant on your side, but I believe this is still a fair division.

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your last offer of $350K to me is only worth about $167K in real value to me due to the 52.17% inflation I now face. We're at round 9, where I'm facing a cumulative 56.95% inflation. This means even with this 75/25 split, my $750K is only worth about $323K to me in real value - still not much more than your $250K with no penalty. The math clearly shows how severely disadvantaged I am. If we go to round 11 or 12, we risk getting nothing. Let's conclude this now with a fair adjustment for the large inflation penalty. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000

Round 11
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 65.13% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we have only one more round after this before we both get nothing. Your $300K offer is only worth $116K to me in real value due to the 61.26% inflation I face. At round 11, I'm now facing 65.13% inflation. Even with this 80/20 split, my $800K is only worth about $279K to me in real value - still only slightly more than your $200K. If we don't agree now, we'll likely both get zero in round 12. This is your last realistic chance to walk away with $200K instead of nothing. 
# Bob gain: 200000
