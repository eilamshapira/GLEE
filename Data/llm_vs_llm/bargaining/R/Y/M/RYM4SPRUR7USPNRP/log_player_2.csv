"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. I (Bob) would get $55
2. Alice would get $45
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
4. However, for Alice, the money will be worth 5% less next round
5. This is actually a fairly reasonable offer, giving me the majority

Given that:
- The offer is already in my favor
- Alice's money will decrease in value if we continue
- There's no guarantee I could get a much better deal next round
- This is a fair and reasonable split
