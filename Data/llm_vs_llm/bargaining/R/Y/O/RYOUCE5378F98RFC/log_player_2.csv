"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate this offer carefully.

Alice is offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000 pot, while she takes $600,000. 

While this isn't an equal split, it's a substantial amount of money. Since inflation isn't affecting me (0% less each round), I don't lose value by rejecting and making a counter-offer in the next round. However, there's always risk in negotiation that the other party might be less generous in future rounds.

Given that I could propose a more favorable split in the next round and there's no penalty for me to wait, I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair counter-offer that addresses both our interests.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing an equal split of the money, which is fair to both of us. This gives us each $500,000, which is a substantial amount that would benefit both parties equally. Since there's no reason one of us should receive more than the other in this scenario, I believe this represents the most equitable solution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer.

Alice is now offering me $450,000 out of the $1,000,000, which is an improvement from her initial offer of $400,000. She would take $550,000.

Interestingly, I've learned that Alice is affected by inflation (her money is worth 19% less than in round 1), while my value remains the same. This gives me some leverage in negotiation as time passes.

Alice has increased her offer to me, likely recognizing that inflation affects her more than me. However, I still believe I can get a better deal in the next round, especially knowing that inflation will continue to impact Alice's share but not mine.

Since there's no penalty for me to wait (0% inflation), and Alice faces increasing inflation pressure, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that I now understand Alice is affected by inflation while I am not, I'll adjust my strategy to propose a fair offer that accounts for this dynamic.

{""bob_gain"": 525000, ""alice_gain"": 475000}

I'm proposing that I receive $525,000 and Alice receives $475,000. This offer slightly favors me, but is reasonably close to an equal split. Since Alice is facing inflation pressure and I am not, this offer gives her a substantial amount now rather than potentially less valuable money in future rounds. This represents a middle ground between my previous equal split and recognizing the time advantage I have in these negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's latest offer.

Alice is now offering me $480,000 out of the $1,000,000, which is another improvement from her previous offers of $400,000 and $450,000. She would take $520,000.

Key considerations:
- Alice is now facing 34.39% inflation compared to round 1
- I continue to face 0% inflation
- Alice has increased her offer to me again
- The inflation penalty for Alice is getting more significant with each round

Alice's $520,000 is actually worth only about $341,172 to her compared to round 1 value (due to the 34.39% inflation). Meanwhile, my $480,000 retains full value.

While I could potentially get an even better deal by rejecting again, Alice may be reaching her limit, and there's a risk she might make a less favorable offer if frustrated. The difference between her offers is narrowing ($50k, then $30k) which suggests we may be approaching her limit.

Given the substantial amount offered to me and the significant inflation Alice faces, I'll accept this offer.
