"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it equally because it's fair for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether this is a good deal given the inflation mechanic.

If I reject this offer, we move to the next round where I get to make a proposal. However, the money will be worth 20% less to me. So if I were to get the full $100 in the next round, it would actually be worth only $80 to me.

Alice is offering me $50 now, which is better than getting $80 in the next round and risking Alice rejecting my offer (which would lead to even more inflation in subsequent rounds).

Given the certainty of getting $50 now versus the uncertainty and guaranteed devaluation in future rounds, I'll accept Alice's fair offer.
