6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we settle now to avoid any loss in value from additional rounds. I offer you $4000 and I take $6000. This way we both secure our gains and mitigate the inflation risk. Looking forward to your favorable response!",Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, I'm feeling generous this round! I'll take $5500 and you can have $4500. Let's end this now and secure our money before it loses more value.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer—but I'm going to reject it. While I appreciate your generosity, I believe it's worth waiting a round since my funds do not depreciate like yours. I'm confident that as the proposer next round I can suggest a division that better reflects the current value dynamics. Looking forward to round 3!",Alice,2,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Bob, in this round the stakes change because your share carries a 20% inflation penalty. To avoid further loss and uncertainty, I propose we split the $10000 equally: you get $5000 (worth effectively $4000 to you now) and I get $5000. I believe this fair and balanced split secures both our interests, considering the devaluation risk on your end. Let’s settle now and avoid any further erosion of value!",Alice,3,
