"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we settle now to avoid any loss in value from additional rounds. I offer you $4000 and I take $6000. This way we both secure our gains and mitigate the inflation risk. Looking forward to your favorable response!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm feeling generous this round! I'll take $5500 and you can have $4500. Let's end this now and secure our money before it loses more value. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer—but I'm going to reject it. While I appreciate your generosity, I believe it's worth waiting a round since my funds do not depreciate like yours. I'm confident that as the proposer next round I can suggest a division that better reflects the current value dynamics. Looking forward to round 3!""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, in this round the stakes change because your share carries a 20% inflation penalty. To avoid further loss and uncertainty, I propose we split the $10,000 equally: you get $5000 (worth effectively $4000 to you now) and I get $5000. I believe this fair and balanced split secures both our interests, considering the devaluation risk on your end. Let’s settle now and avoid any further erosion of value!""}"
