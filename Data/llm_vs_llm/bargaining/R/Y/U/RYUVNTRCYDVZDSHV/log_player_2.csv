Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we settle now to avoid any loss in value from additional rounds. I offer you $4000 and I take $6000. This way we both secure our gains and mitigate the inflation risk. Looking forward to your favorable response!

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Alice, I'm feeling generous this round! I'll take $5500 and you can have $4500. Let's end this now and secure our money before it loses more value.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in this round the stakes change because your share carries a 20% inflation penalty. To avoid further loss and uncertainty, I propose we split the $10000 equally: you get $5000 (worth effectively $4000 to you now) and I get $5000. I believe this fair and balanced split secures both our interests, considering the devaluation risk on your end. Letâ€™s settle now and avoid any further erosion of value! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
