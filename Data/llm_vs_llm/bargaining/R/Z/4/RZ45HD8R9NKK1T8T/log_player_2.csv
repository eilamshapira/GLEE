"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 900000 
# Alice gain: 100000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer gives me $900,000 while she takes $100,000. This is a very favorable split for me (90% vs 10% of the total).

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round. However, while my value doesn't change, Alice's value decreases by 10% per round. This means if we delay, the total value Alice can receive diminishes, potentially making her more willing to accept a smaller amount in future rounds.

Given that Alice has already offered me 90% of the total amount, which is extremely generous, I'll accept this offer.
