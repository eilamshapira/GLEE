"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fairly balanced split, but slightly in my favor since Bob might want to negotiate and there's inflation risk for me.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this division because it's close to fair while giving me a small advantage. If Bob rejects, the next round will have the money worth 10% less to me, so this offer is reasonable."
