"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
* She's offering me $4,500 out of $10,000
* That's 45% of the total amount
* While not exactly equal, it's a reasonable offer
* The money doesn't lose value for me with inflation
* If I reject, I can make a counter-offer, but Alice might reject it

Since it's a substantial amount and there's no downside to taking it now versus later, I'll accept this offer.
