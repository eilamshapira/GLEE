"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a slightly favorable split for myself while keeping it reasonable enough for Bob to accept, considering the 10% inflation penalty per round if he refuses.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I offer $5,500 for myself and $4,500 for Bob. This is a fairly balanced split with a small advantage for me. If Bob rejects this, we'll both lose value due to inflation, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly."
