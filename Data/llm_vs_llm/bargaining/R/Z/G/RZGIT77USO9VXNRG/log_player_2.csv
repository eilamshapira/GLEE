"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer considering the effect of inflation. If I reject, I'll make my own proposal in the next round, but the value of the money will be 5% less for me.

Currently Alice is offering me $4,500. If I reject and move to the next round, the total amount would be worth 5% less to me, so the entire $10,000 would effectively be worth $9,500 to me. Even if I proposed a better split for myself in the next round, Alice might reject it, leading to further rounds and more inflation.

$4,500 now is better than potentially getting slightly more in later rounds with significant inflation risk.
