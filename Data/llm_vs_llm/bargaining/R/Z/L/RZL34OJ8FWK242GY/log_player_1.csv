"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I need to consider the actual value I'll get. 
The offer is $45, but due to inflation, it's worth 20% less, so the actual value for me is $45 * 0.8 = $36.
Considering this, I think I can get a better deal.
{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 20% * 2 = 40% less than in the first round (20% less in round 2 and another 20% less in round 3, which is equivalent to 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 of the original value).
I'll try to get a bit more than half, but not too much to discourage Bob from accepting.
{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","The money I gain is worth 48.8% less, so the actual value for me is $48 * (1 - 0.488) = $48 * 0.512 = $24.58.
Considering this, the offer seems reasonable, but I'll think about the potential future offers.
However, the inflation is significantly affecting my potential gains, and I don't want to risk losing more value.
