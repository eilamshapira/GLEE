Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's aim for a slightly more balanced split. This offer considers the initial round and the slight inflation I'm facing. This is a fair proposal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
