"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a counter-offer in the next round. While Alice's offer gives me $10, it's quite unfair given the total amount of $100. Since Alice's money loses value faster than mine (20% vs 5% per round), she has more incentive to reach an agreement quickly, so I can propose a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a reasonable offer because:
1. It's much more balanced than Alice's initial 90-10 split
2. Alice should be motivated to accept since her money loses value faster (20% per round vs my 5%)
3. If she rejects, her $40 will be worth only $32 in the next round, while my $60 would be worth $57"
