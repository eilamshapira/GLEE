"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but the money will be worth 10% less to me. 
$40 now is worth more than potentially getting more in the next round when it's worth less.

However, I could counter-offer for more in the next round, where $90 for me would still be worth $81 after the 10% depreciation.

Since Alice doesn't face any depreciation and this is a somewhat unfair split, I'll reject and try to negotiate for more.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I should propose a split that's better for me but still reasonable enough that Alice might accept it. I need to account for the 10% depreciation in this round, so I'll aim for a higher amount to compensate.

I'll propose a split where I get $60 (which is actually worth $54 to me due to the 10% depreciation) and Alice gets $40. This is essentially reversing Alice's original offer, which seems fair.

{""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40}

I'll explain to Alice: ""I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering I've already lost 10% value due to inflation."""
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice's offer of $45 to me is now worth only $36.45 (due to 19% depreciation)
2. If I reject, in the next round:
   - The depreciation will increase to 27.1%
   - Even if I got $70, it would be worth only about $51 to me
3. Alice has slightly improved her offer from the first round (from 40/60 to 45/55)
4. Further negotiation might lead to diminishing returns due to increasing depreciation

Given that Alice has shown some willingness to compromise, and the depreciation is significantly affecting my potential gains, I should accept this offer. Getting $36.45 in real value now is better than risking further depreciation.
