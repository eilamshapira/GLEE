"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's keep it fair and split the $1000000 equally. We both win this way! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. This is round 1, so there's no depreciation yet
2. Alice is offering a 50-50 split
3. If I reject:
   - Next round I can make an offer
   - But my money will be worth 20% less
   - Her money will be worth 10% less
   - This gives me some leverage, but also means waiting costs me more than it costs her

A 50-50 split is actually quite fair, and given that inflation will hurt me more than Alice in future rounds (20% vs 10%), getting $500,000 now is better than risking a worse deal later.
