60.0,40.0,"Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  We can adjust if you'd like, but I think this is a good starting point.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
35.0,65.0,Let's try this. I'm proposing a 65/35 split in my favor. This is a better deal for me and ensures we both get something significant before inflation kicks in.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"I understand you want more, but let's not be greedy. A 55/45 split is still a good deal for both of us, especially with inflation.  It's time to compromise, or we risk losing everything.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
30.0,70.0,"Alice, inflation is hurting you more. I'm offering you 30, which is still something. 70 for me, take it or we both lose out.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
40.0,60.0,"We're running out of time. While I'm losing more with each round, I'm still willing to negotiate. A 40/60 split is a fair compromise given the current situation. Let's get this done before we lose everything.",Alice,5,
