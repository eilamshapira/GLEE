"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I need to consider the inflation effect on my potential gains as the rounds progress. Here's my initial offer, trying to balance getting a good amount while also making it appealing enough for Bob to accept:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

Rationale: I'm asking for a slightly larger share, assuming Bob might be willing to accept this in the first round to avoid potential inflation affecting his gains in later rounds as well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the reduced value of the money due to inflation. My potential gain of $4500 now is equivalent to $4500 / 1.2 = $3750 in round 1 value.

Even though Bob is offering me less than I initially proposed for myself, I will accept to avoid further loses due to inflation.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
