"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice has offered a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance. However, I need to consider that:

1. If I reject, the money will be worth 20% less to me in the next round
2. Alice doesn't face any depreciation
3. We have 12 rounds total
4. 50$ now is better than potentially getting slightly more later when it's worth less to me

This is actually a pretty good offer considering the depreciation factor. If I reject, I'd need to secure significantly more than 50$ in the next round to make up for the 20% loss in value. And Alice, knowing she doesn't face depreciation, might be less willing to accept a smaller amount in later rounds.
