"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, which I believe is fair given we both want to resolve this quickly.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is more equitable. Let's get this done, but I believe a more even distribution is fairer. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Bob is offering me $45
2. For Bob, his $55 is actually worth less due to 20% inflation, so it's effectively worth $44 to him
3. If I reject and we go to another round, inflation will affect Bob even more
4. My first offer was rejected, showing Bob is willing to negotiate
5. $45 is still a substantial portion, and getting it now avoids further rounds of negotiation
