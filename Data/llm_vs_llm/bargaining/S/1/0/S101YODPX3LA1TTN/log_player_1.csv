"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll play as Alice in this game. Since the value of money decreases by 20% for me each round, I should try to reach an agreement quickly while ensuring a fair distribution.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I suggest this division because it's reasonably favorable to me while still giving Bob a substantial amount. If we move to the next round, the total value will decrease for me due to inflation, so it's in my interest to reach an agreement now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept this offer. While I'm getting 5000 instead of the 6000 I initially proposed, the 20% inflation means that if I reject and make a counter-offer in round 3, any amount I receive would be worth even less to me. Since $5000 now is worth more to me than potentially getting a larger nominal amount in a future round with compounding inflation, accepting this equal split is the rational choice."
