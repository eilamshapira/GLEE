"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of the $10,000, which is 40% of the total. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but I don't know how inflation might affect Alice's decision-making.

Since there's no inflation for me (0% less value per round), I don't lose anything by rejecting and making a counter-offer. This gives me the opportunity to potentially get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more balanced while still being reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I propose we split the money equally, which is fair to both of us. A 50-50 split represents a balanced division that respects both our interests in this negotiation."
