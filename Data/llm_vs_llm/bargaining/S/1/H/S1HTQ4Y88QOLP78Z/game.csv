550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split where I get slightly more as the first mover. This way we both walk away with a substantial amount without risking inflation losses.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
475000.0,525000.0,"Let's split it fairly, I'm willing to give you a significant share, but as the game progresses, inflation will affect me, so let's find a mutually beneficial agreement ASAP.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, I need to account for the 5% inflation penalty I'm facing each round. This offer gives me $600k (which is worth less to me now) and you $400k (which maintains its full value for you). This is fair considering the inflation impact on my side.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Considering the inflation impact on your side, I'm willing to split it 50/50. This way, we both get a fair share, and you can mitigate some of the inflation losses. Let's agree before it's too late.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, with the inflation penalty now at over 14% and growing, I need a larger nominal amount to achieve a fair outcome. My $650k is actually worth only about $557k to me due to inflation, while your $350k maintains its full value. Please consider this to reach a fair agreement before inflation grows further.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
525000.0,475000.0,"I understand the inflation impact on your side is increasing. I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share to account for this. Let's settle on this offer before the inflation penalty grows even more, making it harder for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
700000.0,300000.0,"Bob, the inflation effect is now over 22% and will keep growing. My $700k would actually only be worth about $541k to me, while your $300k keeps its full value. This split is now necessary to achieve a fair outcome considering the severe inflation penalty I'm facing. Please accept so we can both walk away with a good deal.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"I'm starting to feel the pressure of the game's time limit. Considering the significant inflation impact on your side, I'm willing to give you a larger share. This offer should be more to your liking, given the circumstances. Let's agree before we risk losing everything.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
750000.0,250000.0,"Bob, with only 3 rounds left and inflation now over 30%, my $750k is actually only worth about $523k to me, while your $250k keeps its full value. This split is necessary to reach a fair outcome given the severe inflation penalty I face. We're running out of time - let's make a deal before we both risk getting nothing.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
575000.0,425000.0,"Time is running out, and I know the inflation penalty on your side is severe. I'm making a significant concession, giving you a larger share. This is my best offer - let's settle and ensure we both get something rather than risking everything in the remaining rounds.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
800000.0,200000.0,"Bob, this is our second-to-last round. With inflation at nearly 37%, my $800k is actually only worth about $504k to me, while your $200k keeps its full value. This is our last real chance to make a deal before we risk getting nothing. Please accept this offer - it's fair given the massive inflation penalty I'm facing.",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"This is our last chance. I'm making a final concession, giving you a larger share to account for the extreme inflation penalty you're facing. If we don't agree on this, we'll both get nothing. Let's be reasonable and split it now.",Bob,12,
