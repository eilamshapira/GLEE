Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it fairly, I'm willing to give you a significant share, but as the game progresses, inflation will affect me, so let's find a mutually beneficial agreement ASAP. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The inflation penalty makes this offer less attractive for me - I would only get $475,000 with a 5% reduction in value. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round that better accounts for the inflation effect I'm facing."

""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Bob, I need to account for the 5% inflation penalty I'm facing each round. This offer gives me $600k (which is worth less to me now) and you $400k (which maintains its full value for you). This is fair considering the inflation impact on my side.""

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation impact on your side, I'm willing to split it 50/50. This way, we both get a fair share, and you can mitigate some of the inflation losses. Let's agree before it's too late. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

A 50-50 split might seem fair at first glance, but with the 14.26% inflation penalty, my $500,000 would actually be worth only about $428,700. I'll make a counter-offer that better compensates for this growing inflation effect."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the inflation impact on your side is increasing. I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share to account for this. Let's settle on this offer before the inflation penalty grows even more, making it harder for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

With the 22.62% inflation penalty, the $525,000 would only be worth about $406,245 to me, while Bob's $475,000 maintains full value. This is becoming increasingly unfavorable for me. I need to make a counter-offer that better reflects the growing inflation impact."

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to feel the pressure of the game's time limit. Considering the significant inflation impact on your side, I'm willing to give you a larger share. This offer should be more to your liking, given the circumstances. Let's agree before we risk losing everything. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

With a 30.17% inflation penalty, the $550,000 would only be worth about $384,065 to me, while Bob's $450,000 maintains full value. We only have 4 rounds left, but this offer still doesn't adequately compensate for the severe inflation impact I'm facing. I'll make another counter-offer."

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 425000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

With a 36.98% inflation penalty, the $575,000 would only be worth about $362,365 to me, while Bob's $425,000 maintains full value. With only 2 rounds left, this is getting risky, but this offer still doesn't adequately compensate for the severe inflation impact. I'll make one more attempt at a better deal."

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 43.12% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is our last chance. I'm making a final concession, giving you a larger share to account for the extreme inflation penalty you're facing. If we don't agree on this, we'll both get nothing. Let's be reasonable and split it now. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this final offer. While the 43.12% inflation means my $600,000 is only worth about $341,280 to me, and Bob's $400,000 maintains full value, it's better than both of us getting nothing if we fail to reach an agreement in this last round. The risk of walking away empty-handed outweighs the potential benefit of rejecting this offer."
