"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a division that takes into account that Bob's money loses 10% value each round while mine doesn't. This gives me some negotiating leverage.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose I get $60 and Bob gets $40. This is a fair offer considering that if Bob refuses, his next round's money will be worth less due to his 10% inflation penalty."
