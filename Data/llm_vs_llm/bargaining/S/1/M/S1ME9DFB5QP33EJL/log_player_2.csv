"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share for both 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer:

Alice is proposing that she gets $60 and I get $40, calling it a ""fair share for both."" While I appreciate her attempt to start a negotiation, the division isn't equal, as she's taking 60% of the total amount.

Since I'm the one who needs to decide whether to accept or reject, and we have several rounds available to reach a better agreement, I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a fair counter-offer to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""I propose an equal 50-50 split, which is truly fair for both of us. We both deserve an equal share of the money.""}"
