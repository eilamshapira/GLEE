"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a fair 50-50 split. This is the most equitable division, and while I understand you offered 60-40, an equal division seems most fair. Let's avoid further rounds where my share would lose value due to the 5% inflation penalty. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
