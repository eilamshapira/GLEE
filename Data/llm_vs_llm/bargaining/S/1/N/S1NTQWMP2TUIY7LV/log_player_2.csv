"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice's offer gives me a decent amount of money, I'd like to propose a more balanced split since we both need to agree. Given that I face a 5% discount penalty each round and Alice doesn't, I should make a reasonable counter-offer now.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I need to consider the time pressure since my share loses 5% value each round. I'll propose a more balanced split with a clear rationale.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. This is the most equitable division, and while I understand you offered 60-40, an equal division seems most fair. Let's avoid further rounds where my share would lose value due to the 5% inflation penalty.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer: 58-42, considering inflation, this is more generous than my first offer 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is making a slightly better offer than before, offering me 42% instead of 40%. While this isn't a 50-50 split, I need to consider that with each rejection, my share loses 5% more value. If I reject now and propose again, the inflation will be at 14.26% by round 4, and Alice has no inflation penalty. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush.
