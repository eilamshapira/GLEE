"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob, taking into account the inflation rate difference between us.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a slightly favorable split for myself since I face higher inflation (20% vs your 10%). If we delay, we both lose value, so accepting now maximizes our combined total. This is fair given our different inflation rates.""
}
