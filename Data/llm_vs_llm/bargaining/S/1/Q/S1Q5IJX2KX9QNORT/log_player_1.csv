"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","For the first round, I'll make a reasonable offer to avoid prolonging the game due to the inflation factor affecting my share. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

This offer splits the money evenly between us, hoping Bob will see it as a fair deal and accept, ending the game early to maximize our shares."
