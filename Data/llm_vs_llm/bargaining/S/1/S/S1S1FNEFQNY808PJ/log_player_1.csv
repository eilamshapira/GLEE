"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, but considering the 10% inflation penalty per round that affects me, I should aim for a slightly higher amount to offset potential future losses.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because it's close to fair while giving me a small buffer against inflation if Bob rejects it. I'll get $550,000 and Bob will get $450,000. This is reasonable enough that Bob should accept it, avoiding inflation losses for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept, I'll get $450,000 Ã— 0.9 = $405,000 (due to 10% inflation)
2. If I reject, next round I can make a new offer, but I'll face:
   - Another 10% inflation penalty
   - Risk of Bob rejecting again
   - We're already in round 2 of 12
3. Bob's offer isn't terribly unfair, just reversed from my initial proposal
4. The inflation penalty makes waiting costly for me

Given these factors, I'll accept. While I could try to negotiate for more, the inflation risk makes accepting now a safer choice.
