Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 575000, ""bob_gain"": 425000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, considering the 5% inflation penalty I face each round, I'm suggesting a fair split that accounts for this disadvantage. If we delay, my share becomes less valuable with each round, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. This offer gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging my inflation constraint.""}"
