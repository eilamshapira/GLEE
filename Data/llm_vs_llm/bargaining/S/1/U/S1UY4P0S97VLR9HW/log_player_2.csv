"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first move, but it's still a fair amount for you, Bob. Keep in mind that waiting will reduce the total value due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing that I get $40 while she gets $60, justifying the uneven split by noting she's making the first move.

If I reject and we move to round 2, the total pot would be worth 20% less ($80 total). A 50-50 split would then be $40 each, which is the same as what I'm being offered now. However, Alice might not accept an even split in round 2.

Given that the money loses value with each round and my current offer is equivalent to half of the inflation-adjusted pot in the next round, accepting seems reasonable.
