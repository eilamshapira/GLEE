"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice is offering me 4000$ out of 10,000$
2. If I reject, I can make my own offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, my purchasing power next round will be reduced
4. 4000$ now is better than 4000$ next round
5. Still, I think I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer. Since there's 5% inflation affecting my gains each round, I need to act strategically but also be fair enough that Alice accepts.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

A 50-50 split is fair and reasonable. Alice should see this as an improvement from her perspective compared to her initial offer where she tried to take a larger share. If she rejects this, she'll face a round of inflation on her next proposal, so this balanced offer should be attractive to both of us."
