"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 9999, ""bob_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Hi Bob – Here’s my first offer. I propose to take $9,999 and offer you $1. Given that any delay will reduce your share by 5% each round while my money stays steady, accepting now is your best shot. Think it over – a tiny amount today beats a discounted larger sum tomorrow.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I know that if we let this game move on, my share will only deteriorate further while you retain every dollar's full value. Recognizing your strong bargaining position when you propose (as you did in round 1) and the fact that in round 3 you could claim almost the entire sum, I’m offering you the whole $10000 now. I believe a prompt agreement is best for both of us—please accept this offer. 
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
