"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob – Here’s my first offer. I propose to take $9999 and offer you $1. Given that any delay will reduce your share by 5% each round while my money stays steady, accepting now is your best shot. Think it over – a tiny amount today beats a discounted larger sum tomorrow. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 9999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 0, ""alice_gain"": 10000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I know that if we let this game move on, my share will only deteriorate further while you retain every dollar's full value. Recognizing your strong bargaining position when you propose (as you did in round 1) and the fact that in round 3 you could claim almost the entire sum, I’m offering you the whole $10,000 now. I believe a prompt agreement is best for both of us—please accept this offer.""}"
