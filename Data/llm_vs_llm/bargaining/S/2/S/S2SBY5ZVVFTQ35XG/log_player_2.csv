"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I’m proposing that you get $79.05 and I get $20.95 from the $100. If you wait for your turn in round 2, you’ll eventually be able to claim almost all of the pie—but the delay means that your money will be worth 5% less per round and mine 10% less per round. In equilibrium, given our respective discount rates and the 12‐round limit, accepting this offer now gives you the equivalent value of what you’d secure by waiting, while avoiding further erosion. I believe this is a fair deal to conclude our negotiations quickly. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 79.05 
# Alice gain: 20.95 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
