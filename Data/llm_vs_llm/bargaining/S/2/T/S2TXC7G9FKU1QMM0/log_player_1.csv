"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob that considers the inflation dynamics.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering that you face 10% inflation each round while I don't. If we delay too long, the money will be worth much less to you, so accepting now maximizes your actual value.""}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your advantage, but I think a 55-45 split in your favor is more reasonable given the inflation risk I'm taking. Let's settle for this to avoid further devaluation of my share. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
