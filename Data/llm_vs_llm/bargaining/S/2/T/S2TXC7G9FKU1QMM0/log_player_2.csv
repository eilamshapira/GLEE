"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering that you face 10% inflation each round while I don't. If we delay too long, the money will be worth much less to you, so accepting now maximizes your actual value. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your advantage, but I think a 55-45 split in your favor is more reasonable given the inflation risk I'm taking. Let's settle for this to avoid further devaluation of my share.""}"
