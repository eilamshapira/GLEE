"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider this offer carefully.

Alice is offering me $40 while she takes $60. While this isn't an even split, I should consider a few factors:

1. Alice faces 10% inflation per round, so her money loses value each round
2. If I reject, we go to Round 2 where I can make a counteroffer
3. If we reach 12 rounds without agreement, we both get nothing

Since I face 0% inflation, waiting doesn't hurt me financially. I can propose a more favorable split in the next round, and Alice will have more incentive to accept because her money will be worth less.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that accounts for our different inflation situations.

Since Alice faces 10% inflation per round and I don't, I can propose a more favorable split for myself while still giving Alice incentive to accept now rather than later.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'm proposing a split where I receive $55 and Alice receives $45. This is fair considering that if Alice rejects and we continue negotiating, her portion will be worth less in future rounds due to her 10% inflation rate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's new offer carefully.

Alice is now offering me $45 while she takes $55. This is an improvement from her first offer of $40/$60, showing we're moving closer to agreement.

Key considerations:
1. Alice's inflation continues (now at 19% less value for her)
2. If I reject, I can make another counteroffer in Round 4
3. We still have plenty of rounds before the deadline

Since I don't face inflation, I can afford to negotiate further. My previous offer was $55/$45, and Alice's counter is $45/$55, so we're still $10 apart. I believe I can get a better deal by continuing negotiations, especially as Alice's inflation penalty increases.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since we're still negotiating and Alice's money is losing value with each round (now 19% less valuable for her), I'll make a slightly more favorable offer for her than my previous one, but still advantageous for me given our inflation differences.

{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48}

I'm proposing a split where I receive $52 and Alice receives $48. This is a compromise from my previous offer of $55/$45, moving $3 in Alice's direction. Given that she faces continued inflation and I don't, this should be more appealing to her than continuing negotiations for several more rounds where her money will be worth even less."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is now offering an even 50/50 split, which is quite fair. Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice's money has already lost 34.39% of its value due to her 10% per-round inflation
2. If I reject, we'll go to round 6 where I can make another offer
3. If we continue negotiating too long, we both risk getting nothing

A 50/50 split is traditionally considered fair, and Alice has moved substantially from her initial position. While I could try to negotiate for slightly more, the risk of prolonged negotiations isn't worth the potential small gain, especially since Alice's inflation penalty is already significant.
