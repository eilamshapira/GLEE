"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"":8000,""bob_gain"":2000,""message"":""Let's start with a generous offer. I believe this is a fair division to kick things off!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given that the money is now worth 20% less to you, this offer gives you $4000, which is equivalent to $3200 in your current valuation. This is a fair split considering the depreciation factor, and we can avoid further losses by agreeing now. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
