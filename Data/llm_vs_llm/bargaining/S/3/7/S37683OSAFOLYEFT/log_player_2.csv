"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a generous offer. I believe this is a fair division to kick things off! 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me only 20% of the total amount ($2000), while keeping 80% ($8000) for herself. 

Given that:
1. For each round that passes, the money loses 20% of its value for Alice, but maintains its value for me
2. We have 12 rounds total
3. If we don't agree, we both get nothing

I can get a better deal by rejecting this offer. If I make a counter-offer in the next round, the $10,000 will still be worth $10,000 to me, but only $8,000 to Alice. This gives me negotiating leverage.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is now worth 20% less to Alice ($8,000 total value for her), but still worth full value to me, I'll make a more balanced offer that takes this into account.

{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Given that the money is now worth 20% less to you, this offer gives you $4,000, which is equivalent to $3,200 in your current valuation. This is a fair split considering the depreciation factor, and we can avoid further losses by agreeing now.""}"
