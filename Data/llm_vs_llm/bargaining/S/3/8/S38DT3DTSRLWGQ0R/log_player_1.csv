"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. While this might seem uneven, keep in mind that I face 20% inflation each round. If we don't agree soon, we both lose value quickly. This offer gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging my inflation constraint.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but I also have to consider my own 5% inflation. Given that, I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. This offer is more balanced and takes into account the decreasing value of our money with each round. Let's agree before we both lose more value. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your acknowledgment of our inflation situation. Since my inflation is 20% per round compared to your 5%, I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. This is fair considering my significantly higher inflation rate. If we continue negotiating, the total value we both receive will decrease substantially. Let's agree now and maximize our combined outcome.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the significant difference in our inflation rates, I'm willing to compromise. Considering the money's value has already decreased for both of us, I propose a 50-50 split. This way, we both get an equal share, and given your higher inflation rate, it might be more beneficial for you to accept this offer sooner rather than later. Let's split it evenly and avoid further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50
