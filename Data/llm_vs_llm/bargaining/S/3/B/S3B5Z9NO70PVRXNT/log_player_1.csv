"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","According to a standard alternating‐offers analysis (in which the discount factors are δ₍Alice₎ = 0.95 per round and δ₍Bob₎ = 0.90 per round), if we assume both players are perfectly rational, then in the subgame perfect equilibrium the proposer (Alice in round 1) will secure a share of

  Alice’s share = (1 – δ₍Bob₎)⁄(1 – δ₍Alice₎·δ₍Bob₎)
         = (1 – 0.90)⁄(1 – 0.95×0.90)
         = 0.10⁄(1 – 0.855)
         = 0.10⁄0.145 ≈ 0.6897

of the $10,000 pot, and Bob’s share would be the remainder:
  Bob’s share ≈ 31.03%

Thus, my intended (and fair from a strategic viewpoint) proposal in round 1 is to secure about $6,896.55 for me (Alice) and offer Bob about $3,103.45.

Below is the JSON message for my proposal:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500
