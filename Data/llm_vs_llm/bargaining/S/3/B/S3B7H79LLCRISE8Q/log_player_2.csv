"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
- It's a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
- If I reject, I'll make the next offer, but:
  * The money will be worth 20% less to me
  * 50$ now is better than potentially getting more later with the inflation penalty
  * There's no guarantee Alice will accept a better offer from me

Since this is a fair offer and the inflation penalty makes waiting risky, I'll accept.
