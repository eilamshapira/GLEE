"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $40 while she gets $60 of the $100 total.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value will decrease by 5% for me (to $95 effective value) and by 20% for Alice (to $80 effective value). This significant difference in our inflation rates gives me some leverage.

Given the substantial difference in our discount rates, I should be able to get a better deal by making a counter-offer next round. The offer isn't terrible, but I can likely do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I'm making the offer now, I need to consider the inflation that has already occurred. The $100 is now effectively worth $95 to me and only $80 to Alice due to our different inflation rates.

I should propose a split that's better for me while still being attractive enough for Alice to accept. Given that Alice stands to lose more from another round of inflation (20% vs my 5%), I have some negotiating advantage.

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I propose this split because it gives me a better portion than Alice's initial offer, while still ensuring Alice gets a significant amount. If she rejects and we go to another round, the money will be worth even less to her, so accepting $40 now is better than risking further depreciation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this new offer considering the inflation that has occurred.

Alice is now offering me $50 of the $100, which is better than her initial offer of $40. Due to inflation, the money I gain is worth 9.75% less than in round 1, meaning $50 now is effectively worth about $45.13 to me in round 1 terms.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 4:
- For me, money will be worth even less (another 5% reduction)
- For Alice, money will be worth significantly less (another 20% reduction)

Since Alice has moved considerably from her initial position (from 40:60 to 50:50), and considering the continued inflation risk for both of us (especially for Alice), this seems like a reasonable compromise.
