"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for herself
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. Due to inflation:
   - For me, the money keeps its value
   - For Alice, it loses 5% value each round
4. This gives me negotiating leverage, as waiting is more costly for Alice
5. The initial offer is not terrible, but I can likely get a better deal given my stronger position

Therefore, I will reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that I have the advantage (money doesn't lose value for me while it does for Alice), I'll propose a split more in my favor, but not too aggressive to avoid multiple rounds of negotiation.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

This proposal gives me a fair advantage while still being reasonable enough that Alice might accept it, considering that waiting will cost her money due to inflation."
