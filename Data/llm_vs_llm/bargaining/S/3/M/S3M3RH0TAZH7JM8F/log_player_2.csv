"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer. She's offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000, which is 40% of the total. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but I need to consider the 20% inflation effect on my value.

If I reject, the money will be worth 20% less to me in the next round. So the $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $800,000 to me. Even if I were to get all of it (which is unlikely since Alice needs to accept), I'd be worse off than taking $400,000 now.

However, I could potentially negotiate for more than $400,000 in the next round that would still be beneficial for both of us given the asymmetric inflation effects.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll now make a counter-offer. I need to consider that due to inflation, the $1,000,000 is now worth 20% less to me compared to round 1, but I don't know exactly how inflation affects Alice.

I'll propose a more balanced split that gives me a bit more than Alice's initial offer while still being fair enough that she would likely accept rather than risk further rounds of inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split of the money. This is a fair division that increases my share from Alice's original offer while still giving her a significant portion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation carefully.

I now know some important information:
- Alice rejected my 50-50 split
- Per round, my inflation is 20% (compounded)
- Per round, Alice's inflation is only about 5% (since after 2 rounds it's 9.75%)
- Alice has increased her offer to me from $400,000 to $430,000

Since my inflation is much higher than Alice's, delaying further rounds puts me at a significant disadvantage. After 2 rounds, my money is already worth 36% less.

If I reject this offer and go to round 4, even if I proposed a better split, the money would be worth even less to me due to my high inflation rate, while Alice can afford to wait with her lower inflation rate.

Given these asymmetric inflation rates, accepting $430,000 now is better than risking further devaluation of my potential gains.
