45.0,55.0,"Alice, every extra round costs both of usâ€”especially you with the steeper 10% discount. To avoid further losses, I'm offering a division where I receive 55 and you receive 45. This way you secure more immediate value than risking a later round. I believe this is fair under the circumstances. What do you say?",Bob,2,
