Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every extra round costs both of usâ€”especially you with the steeper 10% discount. To avoid further losses, I'm offering a division where I receive 55 and you receive 45. This way you secure more immediate value than risking a later round. I believe this is fair under the circumstances. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
