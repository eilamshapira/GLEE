Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, every extra round costs both of usâ€”especially you with the steeper 10% discount. To avoid further losses, I'm offering a division where I receive 55 and you receive 45. This way you secure more immediate value than risking a later round. I believe this is fair under the circumstances. What do you say?""}"
