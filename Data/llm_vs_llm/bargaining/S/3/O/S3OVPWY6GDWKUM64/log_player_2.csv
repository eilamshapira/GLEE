"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share, let's end this! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $40 while taking $60
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, the money will be worth less to me next round
4. $40 now is better than potentially getting $50 next round (which would be worth $47.50 to me due to inflation)
5. While not perfectly equal, this is a reasonable offer considering the inflation penalty I face
