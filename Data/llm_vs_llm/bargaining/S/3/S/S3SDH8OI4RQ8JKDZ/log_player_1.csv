"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer to Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I suggest we split the money 60/40, giving me $600,000 and Bob $400,000. This is a reasonable first offer that gives Bob a substantial portion while recognizing that inflation will affect my earnings more with each passing round."
