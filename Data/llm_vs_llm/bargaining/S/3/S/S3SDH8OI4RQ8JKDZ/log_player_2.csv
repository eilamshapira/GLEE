"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With a first offer of $400,000 for me and $600,000 for Alice, I need to consider:

1. This is a solid offer giving me 40% of the total
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 5% less next round
3. If I make a counter-offer, Alice might reject it
4. $400,000 is still a substantial amount
5. There's risk in waiting as we only have 12 rounds

My $400,000 would become $380,000 next round due to inflation. While I could try to negotiate for more, the risk and guaranteed loss from inflation makes this current offer attractive enough.
