"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair 50/50 split of the $10000. Settling now guarantees the full value for both of us and avoids the inflation penalty I'm facing in later rounds. I believe this is a win-win starting point. Let me know if you agree! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering a 50/50 split ($5000 each)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but:
   - The money will be worth 5% less to me
   - I don't know how inflation affects Alice
3. This is round 1 of 12, so I have room to negotiate
4. However, a 50/50 split is generally considered fair
5. Taking the deal now guarantees me the full $5000 value

Given that:
- It's a fair initial offer
- Accepting now avoids any inflation penalty
- There's risk in rejection (Alice might become more aggressive)
- The offer reflects good faith negotiation
