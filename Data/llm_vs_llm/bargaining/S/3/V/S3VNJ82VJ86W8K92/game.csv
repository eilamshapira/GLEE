6000.0,4000.0,Hi Bob! I think this is a fair split to start with. Let's make this easy and take our share.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
2000.0,8000.0,"Alice, every round you wait costs you 10% in value. I’m offering you $2000 now to secure your share, while I keep $8000. Accept this offer and let’s both walk away with the best value available—delays only hurt you.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"Okay Bob, let's try this again. I'm offering you $7000 and I take $3000. Time is ticking and you want to get the most value out of this.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"Alice, I understand you want a fair share, but every round you wait means an extra 10% loss in your money's value. In this round your $3000 is effectively worth about $2187, and if we delay further, it will drop even more. I believe this is the best we can do now, so let's settle and avoid further losses for you.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
3500.0,6500.0,"Alright Bob, let's try one more time. I am going to give you $6500 and take $3500. This is my final offer; let's get this done.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
100.0,9900.0,"Alice, consider this: waiting any longer will erode the nominal value of your share even further (by nearly 41% compared to round 1). In round 7, as the proposer, you'll have to concede almost everything to Bob for him to accept. This offer, though small for you nominally, gives you more than what you'll realistically secure if we continue. Accept now and salvage whatever value you can.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
100.0,9900.0,"Bob, I understand your strategy. I accept your previous offer, but I'll propose a very similar one. Let's end this.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,accept
