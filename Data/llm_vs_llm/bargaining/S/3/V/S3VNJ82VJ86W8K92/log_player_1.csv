Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every round you wait costs you 10% in value. I’m offering you $2000 now to secure your share, while I keep $8000. Accept this offer and let’s both walk away with the best value available—delays only hurt you. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want a fair share, but every round you wait means an extra 10% loss in your money's value. In this round your $3000 is effectively worth about $2187, and if we delay further, it will drop even more. I believe this is the best we can do now, so let's settle and avoid further losses for you. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, consider this: waiting any longer will erode the nominal value of your share even further (by nearly 41% compared to round 1). In round 7, as the proposer, you'll have to concede almost everything to Bob for him to accept. This offer, though small for you nominally, gives you more than what you'll realistically secure if we continue. Accept now and salvage whatever value you can. 
# Alice gain: 100 
# Bob gain: 9900
