"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's make this fair and efficient - I propose a 60-40 split. You get a solid $4,000 and we can both walk away happy without losing money to inflation.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be realistic, I'm taking a risk by rejecting your offer. I deserve a slightly larger share. Accept this and we can both walk away with a good deal before inflation eats away at our profits. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The reasoning behind accepting:
1. With 10% inflation, my $4,500 is now worth $4,050 in round 1 terms
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 3, any amount I receive will be worth another 10% less
3. My initial offer of $6,000 would now only be worth $5,400 in real terms even if Bob accepted it
4. $4,050 (real value of current offer) is better than risking further rounds with compounding inflation
5. Bob's offer is reasonable enough given the circumstances"
