"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the money evenly. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer. She's proposing a 50-50 split, which is completely fair and equitable. This is actually a very reasonable first offer that aligns with principles of fairness. While I could reject and try to negotiate for more in the next round, there's also a risk that subsequent negotiations could lead to a worse outcome. 

Given that this is a fair offer right from the start, I'll accept it.
