"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. 

Alice is offering me $100,000 while keeping $900,000 for herself. This is only 10% of the total amount for me, which seems quite low. If I reject this offer, I'll get to make a counter-proposal in the next round.

However, I need to account for inflation. If I reject, the money will be worth 20% less to me in the next round, meaning the $1,000,000 would effectively be worth only $800,000 from my perspective. For Alice, it would be worth $950,000 due to her 5% inflation rate.

Given the significant inflation penalty for me, and the fact that $100,000 is still a substantial amount, I'll make my decision:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to make a strategic offer that accounts for the inflation rates. Since we're in round 2, the money is worth 20% less to me and 5% less to Alice compared to round 1.

I should offer a fair split that Alice would be likely to accept, considering she faces a smaller inflation penalty than I do if she rejects. If she rejects my offer, she'll make a counter-offer in round 3, but by then, the money will have depreciated further for both of us.

Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split which is fair and gives us both substantial value. Since Alice faces less inflation pressure, she should recognize that accepting this offer now is better than making another offer in the next round when the total value would decrease for both of us."
