5500.0,4500.0,Let's split it fairly considering the inflation risk. This offer gives you a substantial amount while accounting for the decreasing value of the money over time.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, I propose a fair 50/50 split of $10000. Given that delays only risk our returns (especially on my end with inflation), let's settle now and secure an equitable outcome for both of us.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5400.0,4600.0,"I understand the need for a fair split, but considering the inflation risk on my side, I need to secure a bit more. This offer still gives you a significant portion while addressing my concerns.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5400.0,4600.0,"Alice, I know you're concerned about inflation eroding your share. By delaying further, you'll only lock in a worse deal for yourself. My proposal gives you the same nominal amount you'd get in your previous offerâ€”but if we wait, that number effectively drops for you. Let's settle now with 4600 for me and 5400 for you, ensuring you secure what you're effectively entitled to.",Bob,4,
