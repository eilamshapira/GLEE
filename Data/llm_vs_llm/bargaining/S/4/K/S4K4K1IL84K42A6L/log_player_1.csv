Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose a fair 50/50 split of $10000. Given that delays only risk our returns (especially on my end with inflation), let's settle now and secure an equitable outcome for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know you're concerned about inflation eroding your share. By delaying further, you'll only lock in a worse deal for yourself. My proposal gives you the same nominal amount you'd get in your previous offerâ€”but if we wait, that number effectively drops for you. Let's settle now with 4600 for me and 5400 for you, ensuring you secure what you're effectively entitled to. 
# Alice gain: 5400 
# Bob gain: 4600
