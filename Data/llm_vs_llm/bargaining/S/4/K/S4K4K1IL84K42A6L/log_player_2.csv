"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly considering the inflation risk. This offer gives you a substantial amount while accounting for the decreasing value of the money over time. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, I propose a fair 50/50 split of $10,000. Given that delays only risk our returns (especially on my end with inflation), let's settle now and secure an equitable outcome for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the need for a fair split, but considering the inflation risk on my side, I need to secure a bit more. This offer still gives you a significant portion while addressing my concerns. 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4600, ""alice_gain"": 5400, ""message"": ""Alice, I know you're concerned about inflation eroding your share. By delaying further, you'll only lock in a worse deal for yourself. My proposal gives you the same nominal amount you'd get in your previous offerâ€”but if we wait, that number effectively drops for you. Let's settle now with 4600 for me and 5400 for you, ensuring you secure what you're effectively entitled to.""}"
