"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. This offer gives you a substantial amount while considering the impact of inflation on me. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:

1. The total amount is $1,000,000
2. She's offering me $400,000 (40%)
3. She's keeping $600,000 (60%)
4. There's no inflation effect on my end
5. We have 11 more rounds if needed
6. I can make a counter-offer in the next round

While this is a substantial amount, the split isn't quite fair given that inflation doesn't affect me. I can try to negotiate for a better deal since we have many rounds left.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer considering that inflation doesn't affect me:

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""I propose a perfectly equal 50-50 split. This is the fairest solution, and since inflation doesn't affect me, we can conclude this quickly without losing value on your end.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. This offer is closer to an equal split, but still considers the inflation affecting me. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze Alice's new offer:

1. She's offering me $450,000 (45%)
2. She's keeping $550,000 (55%)
3. Due to inflation, her $550,000 is actually worth about $496,375 to her (after 9.75% reduction)
4. My $450,000 maintains its full value
5. We still have 9 more rounds
6. The inflation is starting to impact her position significantly

While this is a better offer than her first one, given that her share is already being devalued by inflation and we still have many rounds left, I believe I can get a better deal. The increasing inflation will likely make her more willing to compromise in future rounds.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that Alice's portion is being affected by inflation, I'll propose an offer that acknowledges this while still aiming for a favorable outcome for me:

{""bob_gain"": 475000,
""alice_gain"": 525000,
""message"": ""Let's be practical - inflation is reducing your gains with each round. This offer gives you a larger share to offset some inflation impact, while still being fair. We should conclude this soon to minimize your losses.""}"
