"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's adjust the split to account for inflation. This is a fairer deal considering the devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I need to calculate the actual value of the offer.

The original amount was $10,000, but due to 10% inflation for me, the value is now $10,000 * 0.9 = $9,000.
For Bob, the value is $10,000 * 0.95 = $9,500.

Bob's offer is $4,500 for me and $5,500 for him. 

Given the circumstances, I think I can get a better deal if I wait.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the value of the money for me has decreased by another 10%, and for Bob, it has decreased by another 5%.

The original amount was $10,000, but due to 20% inflation for me (10% in Round 1 and 10% in Round 2), the value is now $10,000 * 0.9 * 0.9 = $8,100.
For Bob, the value is $10,000 * 0.95 * 0.95 = $9,025.

I'll make an offer that takes into account the decreasing value.
