"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share for both 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering me $45 while keeping $55 for herself. While this isn't an exactly equal split, it's reasonably close to 50-50, and I should consider that rejecting means waiting for another round. Since there's no inflation for me (the money is worth 0% less each round), there's no cost to waiting, but I also don't gain anything by waiting.

Let me evaluate this offer. $45 is a substantial portion of the $100, and it's fairly close to an even split. I could reject and propose a more favorable split for myself in the next round, but Alice might then reject my offer, extending the game further.

Given that the offer is reasonably fair, I'll accept it.
