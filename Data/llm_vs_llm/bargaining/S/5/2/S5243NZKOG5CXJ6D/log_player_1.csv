Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a 50-50 split is the fairest way to divide the money. This way we both walk away with a significant amount, and we can avoid further rounds where inflation will reduce the value for me. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
