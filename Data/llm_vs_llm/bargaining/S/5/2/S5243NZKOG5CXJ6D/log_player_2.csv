"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a solid division. I believe this is a fair offer that allows us both to walk away with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:
1. Alice is offering me $200,000 out of $1,000,000
2. That's only 20% of the total amount
3. If I reject, the money will be worth 10% less next round (so $900,000 total value for me)
4. But I'll have the chance to make a counter-offer
5. Given that we have 12 rounds, I can afford to negotiate for a better deal

This initial offer seems too low - a 20/80 split is not fair. I should reject and propose a more balanced division in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split, considering that:
1. The total value for me is now effectively $900,000 due to 10% inflation
2. I should aim for a fair division while acknowledging that Alice made the first move
3. A message that emphasizes fairness and cooperation might help

""message"": ""I believe a 50-50 split is the fairest way to divide the money. This way we both walk away with a significant amount, and we can avoid further rounds where inflation will reduce the value for me.""}"
