"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's value of the money decreases by 20% each round, and it's now the 3rd round, the money is worth 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 of its original value to Bob. 

To take this into account, I'll make a more favorable offer to myself.
