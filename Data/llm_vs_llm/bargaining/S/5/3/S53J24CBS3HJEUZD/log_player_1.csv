"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in your favor.  This accounts for the time value of money and is a fair deal considering the inflation. Let's close this out. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
