550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we split the money 55/45 in my favor. Since I'm facing 5% inflation per round, I need a slight advantage to account for the decreasing value. This is a fair offer that gives us both substantial amounts without risking further rounds where we both lose value.",Alice,1,

475000.0,525000.0,"Alice, your initial offer was a bit too tilted in your favor.  I'm facing a 5% loss each round, so I need a bit of a cushion to make this worthwhile. This offer is still generous considering your inflation.",Bob,2,

525000.0,475000.0,"Bob, I see we both claim to face 5% inflation per round. Let's meet in the middle between our initial positions. I'm proposing a 52.5/47.5 split which is fair to both of us. We've already lost value over two rounds - further delays will hurt us both. Let's reach an agreement now and both walk away with significant amounts.",Alice,3,

487500.0,512500.0,"Alice, we need to find a solution quickly. I understand your position, but I'm also facing significant losses with each round.  This offer is a compromise, moving closer to the middle ground while acknowledging the time pressure.",Bob,4,

510000.0,490000.0,"Bob, we're now 5 rounds in, and I'm facing a significant inflation penalty. I've moved considerably from my initial position toward a more balanced split. This 51/49 offer is very close to equal and acknowledges both our inflation concerns. Let's not waste more time - further rounds will only diminish the value for both of us. This is a fair compromise that gives us both substantial amounts.",Alice,5,
