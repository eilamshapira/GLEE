"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split the money 55/45 in my favor. Since I'm facing 5% inflation per round, I need a slight advantage to account for the decreasing value. This is a fair offer that gives us both substantial amounts without risking further rounds where we both lose value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer was a bit too tilted in your favor.  I'm facing a 5% loss each round, so I need a bit of a cushion to make this worthwhile. This offer is still generous considering your inflation. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Bob, I see we both claim to face 5% inflation per round. Let's meet in the middle between our initial positions. I'm proposing a 52.5/47.5 split which is fair to both of us. We've already lost value over two rounds - further delays will hurt us both. Let's reach an agreement now and both walk away with significant amounts.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we need to find a solution quickly. I understand your position, but I'm also facing significant losses with each round.  This offer is a compromise, moving closer to the middle ground while acknowledging the time pressure. 
# Alice gain: 487500 
# Bob gain: 512500

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 510000, ""bob_gain"": 490000, ""message"": ""Bob, we're now 5 rounds in, and I'm facing a significant inflation penalty. I've moved considerably from my initial position toward a more balanced split. This 51/49 offer is very close to equal and acknowledges both our inflation concerns. Let's not waste more time - further rounds will only diminish the value for both of us. This is a fair compromise that gives us both substantial amounts.""}"
