"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the money 55/45 in my favor. Since I'm facing 5% inflation per round, I need a slight advantage to account for the decreasing value. This is a fair offer that gives us both substantial amounts without risking further rounds where we both lose value.

# Alice gain: 550000

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we both claim to face 5% inflation per round. Let's meet in the middle between our initial positions. I'm proposing a 52.5/47.5 split which is fair to both of us. We've already lost value over two rounds - further delays will hurt us both. Let's reach an agreement now and both walk away with significant amounts. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're now 5 rounds in, and I'm facing a significant inflation penalty. I've moved considerably from my initial position toward a more balanced split. This 51/49 offer is very close to equal and acknowledges both our inflation concerns. Let's not waste more time - further rounds will only diminish the value for both of us. This is a fair compromise that gives us both substantial amounts. 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000
