Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm sticking to my previous offer, Bob. Time is ticking and inflation is eating away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

I'm still not willing to accept such an uneven deal, even with the pressure of inflation. I need to push for a better split in the next round."
