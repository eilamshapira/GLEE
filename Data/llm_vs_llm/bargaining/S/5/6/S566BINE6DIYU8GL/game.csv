6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering the higher inflation rate I face (20% vs your 5%). Let's make a deal now and both walk away with a good amount.",Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"Hi Alice, considering the inflation rates, I think a 55-45 split is more reasonable. This way, we both get a significant amount, and I'm taking on less of a loss due to inflation.",Bob,2,

5800.0,4200.0,"Bob, let's be practical. With my 20% inflation rate versus your 5%, I need a larger share to compensate for my faster-decreasing value. This 58-42 split is a fair compromise - slightly better for you than my first offer. If we keep negotiating, we both lose more to inflation. Let's agree now.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4300.0,5700.0,"Alice, I understand your concerns about inflation, but I still think you're asking for too much. Considering the current loss in value, I'm willing to offer a 57-43 split. This is a better deal for you than my previous offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, we're both losing money with each round - I've already lost nearly 50% of my potential value while you've only lost 14%. I'm reducing my request to 55-45 split as a significant compromise. This is very close to your first offer but with roles reversed. Let's agree now before inflation erodes our gains further.",Alice,5,
