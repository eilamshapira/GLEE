"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation rates, I think a 55-45 split is more reasonable. This way, we both get a significant amount, and I'm taking on less of a loss due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The inflation rate impacts me much more severely than Bob, and a 45-55 split in his favor doesn't account for this disadvantage. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round that better reflects our different inflation rates."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, 
""bob_gain"": 4200, 
""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical. With my 20% inflation rate versus your 5%, I need a larger share to compensate for my faster-decreasing value. This 58-42 split is a fair compromise - slightly better for you than my first offer. If we keep negotiating, we both lose more to inflation. Let's agree now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns about inflation, but I still think you're asking for too much. Considering the current loss in value, I'm willing to offer a 57-43 split. This is a better deal for you than my previous offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4300 
# Bob gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The inflation impact is becoming significant - I've already lost nearly half the potential value while Bob has only lost about 14%. His offer of 43% to me doesn't adequately address this growing disparity. We need to reach an agreement soon, but it needs to better account for my higher inflation rate."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Bob, we're both losing money with each round - I've already lost nearly 50% of my potential value while you've only lost 14%. I'm reducing my request to 55-45 split as a significant compromise. This is very close to your first offer but with roles reversed. Let's agree now before inflation erodes our gains further.""}"
