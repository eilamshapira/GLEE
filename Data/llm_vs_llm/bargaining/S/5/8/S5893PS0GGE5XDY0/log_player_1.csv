"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since this is the first round and I want to start with a reasonable offer that has a good chance of being accepted while accounting for potential inflation risk, I'll propose a slightly favorable split for Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}

I believe this is a fair opening offer that shows good faith and gives Bob a slight advantage, which might encourage acceptance. If Bob declines, my share will be worth less in the next round due to 5% inflation, so I'm incentivized to make a reasonable offer now."
