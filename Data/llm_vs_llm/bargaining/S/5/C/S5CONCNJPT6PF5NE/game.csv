5000.0,5000.0,"I'm proposing an equal 50-50 split of the money. This is fair for both of us, and we can settle this immediately without risking inflation reducing the total value.",Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"I understand that you want a fair split, but considering the inflation effect on me, I'd like to propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This way, we can both walk away with a reasonable amount before the money loses more value.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"I appreciate your offer, but I need to account for the fact that inflation affects me more severely (20% per round) than it affects you (10% per round). Given this asymmetry, I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor to balance the inflation effects. This way we can both walk away with a fair value before further devaluation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Given that inflation affects you more, I understand your previous proposal. However, to compensate for the risk of further inflation, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This way, we can both still get a reasonable amount.",Bob,4,

6000.0,4000.0,"Bob, inflation is significantly impacting my returns - I'm now facing almost 50% devaluation while you're only at about 27%. At this rate, further delays will hurt both of us substantially. I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor to account for the much higher inflation rate I'm facing. Let's reach an agreement now before the money loses even more value for both of us.",Alice,5,
