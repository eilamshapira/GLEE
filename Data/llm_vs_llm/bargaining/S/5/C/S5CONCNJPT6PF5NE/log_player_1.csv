""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but I need to account for the fact that inflation affects me more severely (20% per round) than it affects you (10% per round). Given this asymmetry, I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor to balance the inflation effects. This way we can both walk away with a fair value before further devaluation.""}"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Bob, inflation is significantly impacting my returns - I'm now facing almost 50% devaluation while you're only at about 27%. At this rate, further delays will hurt both of us substantially. I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor to account for the much higher inflation rate I'm facing. Let's reach an agreement now before the money loses even more value for both of us.""}"
