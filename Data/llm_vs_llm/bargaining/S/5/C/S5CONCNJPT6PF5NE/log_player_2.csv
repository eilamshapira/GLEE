Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm proposing an equal 50-50 split of the money. This is fair for both of us, and we can settle this immediately without risking inflation reducing the total value.

# Alice gain: 5000

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, but I need to account for the fact that inflation affects me more severely (20% per round) than it affects you (10% per round). Given this asymmetry, I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor to balance the inflation effects. This way we can both walk away with a fair value before further devaluation.

# Alice gain: 5500

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, inflation is significantly impacting my returns - I'm now facing almost 50% devaluation while you're only at about 27%. At this rate, further delays will hurt both of us substantially. I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor to account for the much higher inflation rate I'm facing. Let's reach an agreement now before the money loses even more value for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000
