Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the actual value I'm considering is $10,000 * 0.8 = $8,000. However, for the proposal, I'll still use the original $10,000 amount.

To make a fair offer, I'll propose a 50/50 split of the original amount, considering the decreasing value for both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1500 
# Alice gain: 8500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value of the money I would gain is $1500 * 0.64 (1 - 0.36) = $960.

Given this, I still don't think the offer is favorable to me.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 20% * 2 = 40% less for me (since two rounds have passed for me), and 5% * 2 = 10% less for Alice (since two rounds have passed for Alice, but the decrease is 5% per round for her, and one more round has passed for her since her last offer, making it 5% + 4.75% = 9.75% total decrease for her, but I'll consider the 10% decrease for simplicity in my calculations for her).

However, the correct decrease for me is 20% for the first round and another 20% of the 80% remaining for the second round, which results in a total decrease of 36% after the first two rounds, and now after the third round, it's 20% of the 64% remaining, which is 12.8%, making the total decrease 36% + 12.8% = 48.8% for me.

For Alice, the correct decrease is 5% for the first round, and then 4.75% of the remaining 95%, which is the decrease after the second round for her, and now after the third round, it's 5% of the 95% remaining from the last time she made an offer, which was after the first round for her, and then another decrease, making the total decrease for her 5% + 4.75% + 4.725% = 14.475%, approximately 14.5% for simplicity.

Given these considerations, I'll aim for a split that reflects our respective decreases in value but also tries to find a middle ground.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value of the money I would gain is $2000 * 0.4096 (1 - 0.5904) = $819.20.

Given this significant decrease in value for me and the offer being $2000, which is less than half of the original amount, I'm inclined to reject this offer as it still seems unfavorable to me.

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth 59.04% less for me and 18.55% less for Alice.

To calculate the actual values:
- For me, the value is $10,000 * (1 - 0.5904) = $10,000 * 0.4096 = $4,096.
- For Alice, the value is $10,000 * (1 - 0.1855) = $10,000 * 0.8145 = $8,145.

Given these values, I'll make an offer that tries to balance our losses due to inflation.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value of the money I would gain is $2500 * (1 - 0.7379) = $2500 * 0.2621 = $655.25.

Given this significant decrease in value for me, the offer of $2500, which translates to $655.25 in real value, is still a considerable portion of the diminished total value I could get. However, considering Alice's offer and the fact that the value for me has decreased substantially, I need to weigh the option of accepting this offer against the risk of further decreases in value if I reject it.
