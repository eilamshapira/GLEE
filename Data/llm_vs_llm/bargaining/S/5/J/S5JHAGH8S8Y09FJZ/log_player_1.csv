"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I need to consider the shrinking value of the money with each round. In the first round, I'll make a generous offer to increase the chances of acceptance.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the declining value of the money. If I reject this offer and we move to round 3, the total value will be even less. Let's calculate the value of 450,000 in round 2 relative to round 1. It's effectively 450,000 * 0.9 = 405,000.

Now let's consider what might happen if I reject it. I have to propose next turn. Given Bob is pushing for a higher share already, I don't see him backing down, and the value will decrease by 10% again if I pass on this. Therefore, it's best to accept this deal.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
