"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, your initial offer was quite uneven. I propose this more balanced split that recognizes I'm affected by inflation while you might not be. This way we both walk away with a substantial amount and don't risk further rounds of negotiation where the value decreases for me. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
