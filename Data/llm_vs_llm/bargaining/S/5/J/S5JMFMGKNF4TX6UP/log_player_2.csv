"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's end this quickly. I'll take 900k, you get 100k. Seems fair, considering the rounds we have left. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is asking for 900,000$ while offering me only 100,000$. This is a very uneven split, giving me just 10% of the total.

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round. Due to 10% inflation per round, the money will be worth 900,000$ to me next round. So even if I propose a more balanced split like 500,000$ each, my 500,000$ would be worth 450,000$ due to inflation, which is much better than the 100,000$ Alice is offering now.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while acknowledging the inflation effect.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, your initial offer was quite uneven. I propose this more balanced split that recognizes I'm affected by inflation while you might not be. This way we both walk away with a substantial amount and don't risk further rounds of negotiation where the value decreases for me.""}"
