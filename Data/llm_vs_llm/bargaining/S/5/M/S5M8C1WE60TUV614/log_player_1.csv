"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob that accounts for the 20% depreciation per round, aiming for a fair division that he'll accept immediately.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""I'm proposing an equal 50-50 split of the money. This is fair for both of us, and accepting now means we both get maximum value since inflation will reduce our shares in future rounds.""
