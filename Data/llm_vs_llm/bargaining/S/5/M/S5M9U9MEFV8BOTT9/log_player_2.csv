"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $4,000 while she takes $6,000 of the $10,000 total. 

If I reject and we go to the next round, I'll face 10% inflation on my portion. However, I'll also get to make the next offer. If we're looking at pure economics, my $4,000 now is worth more than $4,000 in the next round (which would be worth $3,600 to me due to inflation).

Since this is the first round and I have the opportunity to make a counter-offer, I think I can negotiate for a better split.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that accounts for the inflation I'm facing while still being reasonable to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I'm proposing a more favorable split for myself, but still offering Alice a substantial portion. Given that I face 10% inflation per round, it makes sense for me to seek a better deal now. I hope Alice recognizes that a fair agreement early in the game benefits us both, as continued negotiations will reduce the total value we can share due to my inflation penalty."
