"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, my money will be worth less next round
4. $40 now is better than $40 in future rounds due to inflation
5. Still, I think I can get a better deal by negotiating

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair offer while accounting for inflation:
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I propose this split because:
1. It's more balanced than Alice's initial offer
2. Alice should recognize that rejecting this and making a counter-offer would mean both our shares would be worth less due to inflation
3. 55-45 split is reasonable enough that Alice might accept to avoid further inflation losses
4. If Alice rejects, my next opportunity to make an offer would be in round 4, where significant inflation will have occurred"
