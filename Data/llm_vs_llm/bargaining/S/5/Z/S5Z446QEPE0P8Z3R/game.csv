8000.0,2000.0,"Hi Alice, in view of the inflation effect, if you reject this offer you'll be forced into round 3 where your money will be worth only 80% (about $6400 in effective value). To make sure you're as well off as you can be, I'm offering you $8000 nominal, which gives you that effective value now. I believe this is fairâ€”please accept.",Bob,2,
