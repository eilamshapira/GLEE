"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, in view of the inflation effect, if you reject this offer you'll be forced into round 3 where your money will be worth only 80% (about $6400 in effective value). To make sure you're as well off as you can be, I'm offering you $8000 nominal, which gives you that effective value now. I believe this is fairâ€”please accept. 
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
