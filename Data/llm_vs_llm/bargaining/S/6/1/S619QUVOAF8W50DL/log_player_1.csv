"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer that is fair but also accounts for the inflation effect on me.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'd like to propose a slightly favorable split for me, as I know the money will be worth less to me in future rounds due to inflation. This is a reasonable offer that gives both of us a substantial portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
