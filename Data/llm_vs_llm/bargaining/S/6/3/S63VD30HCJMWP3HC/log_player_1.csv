"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60/40 seems reasonable""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know we both want to maximize our gains before further value is lost. If we agree now, we secure more value than waiting for future rounds. I propose $5200 for me and $4800 for you. Let's settle now and avoid the inflation hit! 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the fact that the total value of the money is now 20% less, I think Bob's offer is reasonable. To calculate the actual value, the original $10,000 is now worth $8,000 due to the 20% decrease.
