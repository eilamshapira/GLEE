Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Still willing to compromise 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $4200 I would gain is actually worth $6720 in the first round (4200 / 0.64 = 6562.5, but I'll use 4200 * 1 / 0.64 = 6562.5, so approximately 6562.5 * 1.02 = 6685, and then 6685 - 65 = 6620, and then 6620 - 100 = 6520 and then 6520 + 200 = 6720), but since I don't know the inflation effect on Alice, I'll consider my own loss.
