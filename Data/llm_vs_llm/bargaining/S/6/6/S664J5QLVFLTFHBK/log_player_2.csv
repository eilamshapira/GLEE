"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair 50/50 split. What do you think about this even division, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this... 

Alice is offering a 50/50 split, which seems fair on the surface. However, I need to consider the inflation factor. If I reject this offer, the value decreases by 20% in the next round. So if I were to make a counter-offer in round 2, the $100 would effectively be worth $80 to me.

Given this inflation pressure and the fact that 50/50 is a standard fair division, I think this is a reasonable first offer.
