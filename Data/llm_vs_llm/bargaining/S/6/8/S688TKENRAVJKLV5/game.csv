,,,Bob,1,reject
1.0,999999.0,"Alice, if you reject this offer, you'll be proposer in Round 3—but the equilibrium outcome then leaves you with nothing due to the inflation penalty and my subsequent optimal play. Accept this minimal amount now to secure a positive payoff rather than risking zero later.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
902500.0,97500.0,"The pot is shrinking.  $97500 is a good deal for you now, considering the inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
1.0,999999.0,"Alice, the value of any amount you get is devalued by another 5% if we delay further. If you reject this offer, you'll be the proposer in Round 5, but the equilibrium outcome there forces you to concede nearly everything to me in order to induce my acceptance—leaving you effectively nothing. Accept this offer now: you get $1 (worth about $0.86 in Round 1 value) rather than a zero payoff later. Please accept.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
857375.0,142625.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Take $142625 now, or watch the total value continue to plummet. You're only hurting yourself at this point.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
1.0,999999.0,"Alice, every round you wait costs you even more. In Round 7, you'll be the proposer, but the inflation will have slashed your effective value to about 73.5% of its face value—and you'll be forced to give Bob nearly everything to secure his acceptance. In contrast, this offer guarantees you something rather than nothing. Accept $1 now rather than risking an outcome that leaves you with virtually zero.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
814506.0,185494.0,"Bob, I'm making one last reasonable offer. $185494.  This is your last chance to get a substantial sum. If you reject this, I'm playing hardball from here on out.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
1.0,999999.0,"Alice, every round you delay only worsens your outcome due to inflation. If you reject this offer, you'll become the proposer in Round 9—but as the backward‐induction analysis shows, you'll be forced to offer Bob almost all of the money, leaving you with nothing (nominally zero). Accept $1 now (which, even after the 30% discount, is still positive) rather than risk a future outcome where you get nothing.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
773781.0,226219.0,"This is it, Bob. Take it or leave it. The pot is shrinking rapidly.  Don't be greedy.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
1.0,999999.0,"Alice, with further delay your money continues to devalue sharply – by round 11 your effective payoff would drop even more due to compounded inflation. If you reject this offer, as the proposer in round 11 you’d be forced to concede nearly the entire pot to me in order for me to agree to any division in view of my full-value bargaining power. Accept this offer now: although you nominally receive $1, it’s worth about $0.63 in current value – essentially matching what you’d get if you risk further rounds. This is the equilibrium outcome that minimizes your loss.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
735092.0,264908.0,"Bob, I'm giving you one last chance.  If you reject this, we both get nothing.  Don't be foolish.",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,reject
1.0,999999.0,"Alice, this is the final round. There's no tomorrow, and if you reject, both of us walk away with nothing. I know the inflation has hurt your share considerably, but even a discounted $1 is still better than $0. Accept this offer and secure at least a minimal positive payoff rather than losing everything.",Bob,12,
