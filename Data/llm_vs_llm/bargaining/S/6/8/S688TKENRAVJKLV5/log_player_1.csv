Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, if you reject this offer, you'll be proposer in Round 3—but the equilibrium outcome then leaves you with nothing due to the inflation penalty and my subsequent optimal play. Accept this minimal amount now to secure a positive payoff rather than risking zero later.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the value of any amount you get is devalued by another 5% if we delay further. If you reject this offer, you'll be the proposer in Round 5, but the equilibrium outcome there forces you to concede nearly everything to me in order to induce my acceptance—leaving you effectively nothing. Accept this offer now: you get $1 (worth about $0.86 in Round 1 value) rather than a zero payoff later. Please accept.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every round you wait costs you even more. In Round 7, you'll be the proposer, but the inflation will have slashed your effective value to about 73.5% of its face value—and you'll be forced to give Bob nearly everything to secure his acceptance. In contrast, this offer guarantees you something rather than nothing. Accept $1 now rather than risking an outcome that leaves you with virtually zero.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every round you delay only worsens your outcome due to inflation. If you reject this offer, you'll become the proposer in Round 9—but as the backward‐induction analysis shows, you'll be forced to offer Bob almost all of the money, leaving you with nothing (nominally zero).

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, with further delay your money continues to devalue sharply – by round 11 your effective payoff would drop even more due to compounded inflation. If you reject this offer, as the proposer in round 11 you’d be forced to concede nearly the entire pot to me in order for me to agree to any division in view of my full-value bargaining power. Accept this offer now: although you nominally receive $1, it’s worth about $0.63 in current value – essentially matching what you’d get if you risk further rounds. This is the equilibrium outcome that minimizes your loss.
