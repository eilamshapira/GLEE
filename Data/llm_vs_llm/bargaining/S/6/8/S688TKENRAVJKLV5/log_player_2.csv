Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 999999, ""alice_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Alice, if you reject this offer, you'll be proposer in Round 3—but the equilibrium outcome then leaves you with nothing due to the inflation penalty and my subsequent optimal play. Accept this minimal amount now to secure a positive payoff rather than risking zero later.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4

If you reject this offer, you'll be the proposer in Round 5, but the equilibrium outcome there forces you to concede nearly everything to me in order to induce my acceptance—leaving you effectively nothing. Accept this offer now: you get $1 (worth about $0.86 in Round 1 value) rather than a zero payoff later. Please accept.""}"

Round 6

In Round 7, you'll be the proposer, but the inflation will have slashed your effective value to about 73.5% of its face value—and you'll be forced to give Bob nearly everything to secure his acceptance. In contrast, this offer guarantees you something rather than nothing. Accept $1 now rather than risking an outcome that leaves you with virtually zero.""}"

Accept $1 now (which, even after the 30% discount, is still positive) rather than risk a future outcome where you get nothing.""}"

Round 10

If you reject this offer, as the proposer in round 11 you’d be forced to concede nearly the entire pot to me in order for me to agree to any division in view of my full-value bargaining power. Accept this offer now: although you nominally receive $1, it’s worth about $0.63 in current value – essentially matching what you’d get if you risk further rounds.

There's no tomorrow, and if you reject, both of us walk away with nothing. I know the inflation has hurt your share considerably, but even a discounted $1 is still better than $0. Accept this offer and secure at least a minimal positive payoff rather than losing everything.""}"
