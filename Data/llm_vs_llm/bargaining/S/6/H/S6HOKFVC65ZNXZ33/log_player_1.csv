"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I need to consider that $4000 is actually worth $3200 to me. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Due to inflation, the money I gain is now worth 20% * 2 = 40% less than in the first round (20% less in round 2 and another 20% less in round 3, but it's cumulative: 20% of the remaining 80% is 16%, so 20% + 16% = 36%, approximately 40% less in total, but to be precise: 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64, so it's 36% less). 

So, I'll make an offer that takes this into account.

{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 48.8% less, I need to consider that $3000 is actually worth $3000 * (1 - 0.488) = $3000 * 0.512 = $1536 to me.

Considering this, I think I should accept the offer, as it's better than risking further inflation.
