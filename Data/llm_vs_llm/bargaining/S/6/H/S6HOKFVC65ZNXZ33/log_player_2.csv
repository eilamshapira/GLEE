"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Since Alice's money loses 20% value each round, and mine maintains its value, I have an advantage in rejecting and making a counter-offer. If we go to the next round:
- My $5000 would still be worth $5000
- Her $5000 would only be worth $4000 to her

Therefore, I could potentially negotiate a better deal in the next round, as she would be more motivated to accept due to the depreciation of value.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice's money loses 20% value each round, I can propose a split that gives me more while still being appealing to Alice. From her perspective:
- In this round, each $1000 is worth $800 to her
- If she rejects and we go to round 3, her money will be worth even less (60% of original value)

I'll propose a 6000/4000 split. For her, $4000 at 80% value ($3200) is better than risking another round where her share would be worth even less.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

This offer is fair considering the depreciation factor, and it's in her best interest to accept rather than continue to lose value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

Alice is offering me $3500, which is too low considering I have the advantage of no value depreciation. Her $6500 is actually only worth $4160 to her (64% of 6500) due to the 36% depreciation in this round.

If I reject and we go to round 4:
- My money will still maintain its full value
- Her money will be worth even less (only 51.2% of original value)
- I can make another offer where she might be more desperate to accept due to the severe depreciation

Since I'm in a stronger negotiating position, and this offer gives me significantly less than even the initial 50-50 split:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","At this point, Alice's money has depreciated significantly. In this round, any money Alice receives is worth only 51.2% of its original value (a 48.8% depreciation). This gives me a very strong negotiating position.

If she rejects this offer, in the next round her money will only be worth about 41% of the original value, which puts her in an even worse position.

Given this, I'll propose:

{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000}

This offer is actually reasonable for Alice because:
- For her, $3000 at 51.2% value is worth about $1536
- If she rejects, any money in the next round will be worth even less
- She's better off accepting this than risking another round of depreciation

This split maximizes my advantage while still giving Alice enough incentive to accept rather than risk further depreciation."
