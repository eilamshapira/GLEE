Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concern about inflation, but your previous offer doesn't seem quite fair considering the potential devaluation. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This acknowledges the inflation factor while still offering you a reasonable share.
