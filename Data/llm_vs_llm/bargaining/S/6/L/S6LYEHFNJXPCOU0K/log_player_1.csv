"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me propose a fair split, considering I need to make it attractive enough for Bob to accept, while accounting for the 20% inflation penalty if we move to the next round.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because:
1. It's close to a 50-50 split, which is generally seen as fair
2. If Bob rejects and we move to the next round, my potential gains will be worth 20% less
3. Bob might be motivated to accept a reasonable first-round offer rather than risk further negotiations"
