"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
- Alice is offering me $450,000 (45%) and keeping $550,000 (55%)
- If I reject, we move to next round where I can make an offer
- However, due to 10% inflation, in next round the money will be worth less to me
- $450,000 now is better than $500,000 in next round (which would be worth $450,000 after 10% inflation)
- This is a reasonable first offer that gives me a significant portion
