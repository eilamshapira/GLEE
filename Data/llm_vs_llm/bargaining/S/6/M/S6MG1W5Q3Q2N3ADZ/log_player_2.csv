"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
1. She's offering me $40 out of $100
2. While this isn't a 50-50 split, it's a decent first offer
3. If I reject, the money will be worth 20% less next round (only $80 total)
4. Even if I propose a better split next round, Alice might reject, leading to further depreciation

I'll accept this offer. Getting $40 now is better than risking further negotiations with the value decreasing each round.
