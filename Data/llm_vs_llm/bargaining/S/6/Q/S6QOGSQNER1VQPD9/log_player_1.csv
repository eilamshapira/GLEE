"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split while accounting for the risk of inflation if Bob rejects.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable offer that gives Bob a substantial portion while protecting my interests against potential inflation in future rounds."
