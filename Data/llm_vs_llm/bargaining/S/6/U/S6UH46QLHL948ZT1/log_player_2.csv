Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000}

I propose we split the money in a way that's advantageous to both of us. The longer we negotiate, the less this money will be worth due to the 5% inflation per round. With this split, we both walk away with significant amounts rather than risking further depreciation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing a more balanced split that gives us both substantial value. The money is already worth 14.3% less for me since round 1 due to inflation, and if we keep negotiating, we'll both lose more value. This offer gives you a very fair share while acknowledging my position as well."
