"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split it 60-40 in my favor. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that she gets $60 and I get $40. If I reject and move to the next round, my purchasing power will be reduced by 20% due to inflation. So in the next round, $100 would only be worth $80 to me, meaning even if I proposed a 50-50 split, I'd only effectively get $40 worth of value.

Given that accepting now gives me $40, and rejecting risks getting less value in the next round due to inflation, I should accept this offer.
