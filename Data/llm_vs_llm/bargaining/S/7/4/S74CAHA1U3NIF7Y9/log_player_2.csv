"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair and equal split of the money. This way, we both walk away with $50, which is a win-win solution. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's first offer carefully. She's proposing a 50-50 split which would give each of us $50. This is a perfectly fair and equal division that maximizes our joint outcome.

Given that we have a limited number of rounds and both risk getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement, accepting a fair split now seems reasonable. There's no guarantee that continuing negotiations would lead to a better outcome for me.
