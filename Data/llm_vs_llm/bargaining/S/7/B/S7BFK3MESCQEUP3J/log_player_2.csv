"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split, let's be reasonable 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully, taking into account the 5% inflation penalty for each round if I reject.

Alice is offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000 total (40%). If I reject, we move to the next round where I get to make an offer, but the money will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation.

If I reject now, the maximum I could reasonably get in the next round would be more than 40%, but that amount would be subject to 5% inflation, and Alice might reject my counter-offer anyway, leading to further inflation penalties.

Given that $400,000 is a substantial amount and the risk of losing value through inflation, I'll accept this offer.
