"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split where I get 55% and you get 45%. This is a reasonable offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and it's better to secure a good amount now than risk losing everything through multiple rounds. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me 450,000$
2. If I reject and wait for next round:
   * The money will be worth 10% less to me
   * Maximum I could get in round 2 would be worth 900,000$ (if I propose keeping most)
   * But Alice would likely reject an unfair offer
   * The 450,000$ now would be worth more than 450,000$ in future rounds

While a 50-50 split might seem more fair, this is a reasonable first offer and the inflation penalty makes waiting risky. Getting 450,000$ now is better than risking further negotiations with value deterioration.
