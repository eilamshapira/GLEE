"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a slightly favorable split for myself, considering that:
1. I have the first-mover advantage
2. Bob's money depreciates faster than mine (10% vs 5% per round)
3. It's in both our interests to resolve this quickly

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

My proposal gives Bob a substantial amount while keeping a reasonable advantage for myself. This is fair considering I'm making the first move, and if Bob rejects, both our potential gains will decrease due to inflation."
