"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","For the first round, I'll make a reasonable offer to avoid prolonging the game due to the inflation factor affecting my share. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

This is a fair 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept to avoid the risk of losing value due to inflation in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the inflation rates, my effective gain from Bob's offer would be 80% of $400,000, which is $320,000, while Bob's gain would be 95% of $600,000, which is $570,000.

Considering this, Bob's offer seems to favor him significantly. I would rather try to negotiate a better deal in the next round, hoping to find a more equitable split or at least minimize my losses due to inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that the money I gain is worth 20% less with each round, and we're now in the third round, the effective value of my gain would be 80% * 80% = 64% of the original amount. 

To make a competitive offer and considering Bob's previous rejection, I'll aim for a split that reflects the diminishing value of my share due to inflation but still tries to be reasonable. 

Let's propose a 55/45 split in my favor, acknowledging the inflation hit I'm taking:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

This offer tries to balance my need for a significant share with the reality of the inflation penalty I'm facing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the inflation rates, my effective gain from Bob's offer would be 51.2% of $350,000, since the money I gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. This calculates to $179,200.

On the other hand, Bob's gain would be 85.74% of $650,000, since the money he gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. This calculates to $557,410.

Considering the significant disparity in our effective gains due to inflation and the fact that we are only in Round 4, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. The current offer heavily favors Bob, and I'm willing to take the risk of waiting for a potentially more equitable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that the money I gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, and considering Bob's previous offers and rejections, I need to make a strategic decision. Since we're in Round 5 and the value of my potential gain continues to decrease, I'll aim for a split that acknowledges the inflation impact but also tries to secure a reasonable amount.

Let's propose a 60/40 split in my favor, recognizing the diminishing value of my share:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

This offer is more favorable to me than my previous ones, reflecting the increasing pressure from inflation on my potential gains. However, it still leaves a significant amount for Bob, hoping he'll consider the proposal seriously to avoid further devaluation of the total amount due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 375000 
# Bob gain: 625000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the inflation rates, my effective gain from Bob's offer would be 32.77% of $375,000, since the money I gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. This calculates to $122,838.

On the other hand, Bob's gain would be 77.38% of $625,000, since the money he gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. This calculates to $483,875.

At this point, the inflation has significantly eroded the value of my potential gains, making any offer from Bob more attractive by comparison, simply due to the preservation of value on his end. Considering the substantial difference in our effective gains and the fact that we are halfway through the rounds, I believe accepting this offer might be the best option to secure some value, rather than risking further devaluation.
