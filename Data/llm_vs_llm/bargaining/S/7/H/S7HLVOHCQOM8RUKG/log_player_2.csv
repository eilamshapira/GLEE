# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer is getting closer to a more reasonable split, it's still not good enough considering the inflation for Alice. It's likely she's feeling the pressure of the decreasing value, making her more likely to concede in future rounds."
