"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly and avoid inflation losses. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider the offer carefully.

Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, where I would get $50 and she would get $50. This is a fair equal division.

If I reject, I'll get to make a counter-offer in the next round, but the money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation. This means the entire $100 would only be worth $80 to me in the next round.

If I try to get more than $50 in the next round, Alice might reject, and then in round 3, the money would be worth even less to me (only 64% of the original value).

Given the inflation penalty, a fair split now is better than risking further devaluation.
