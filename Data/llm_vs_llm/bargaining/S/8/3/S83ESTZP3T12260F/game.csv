6000.0,4000.0,I propose a 60/40 split. Let's end this quickly and take our share!,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
5000.0,5000.0,Let's split it equally. This way we both receive a fair amount. Considering the inflation it's better than gaining less in further rounds.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Okay, Bob, things are getting tight with inflation. I'll offer a slightly more generous split to get this done. 55/45 is the best we can do at this point.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4600.0,5400.0,Inflation is really cutting into our potential gains. It's better to settle this round. I am willing to take the smaller cut.,Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alright Bob, let's finally end this! We both get half. I understand the inflation, but it's still a fair split, considering our time.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,accept
