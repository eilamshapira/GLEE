"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly! I'm taking a little more to account for the inflation difference. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $4,500 of the $10,000
2. If I reject and we go to next round:
   * The money will be worth 20% less to me
   * My maximum potential gain in next round would be worth less than 4,500
   * I would have to make an offer that Alice would accept, considering her 10% inflation rate

Alice's reasoning about the inflation difference is fair, and getting $4,500 now is better than risking a lower value in the next round due to the higher inflation rate affecting me.
