"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. Alice is proposing that I get $450,000 while she gets $550,000. 

If I reject this offer, I'll be able to make a counter-proposal in the next round, but inflation will reduce the value of the money by 5%. So the $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $950,000 to me in the next round.

If I accept now, I get $450,000. If I reject and propose a better split for myself next round, the most I could reasonably get would be somewhat more than $450,000, but the 5% inflation would eat into those gains.

Given that we have 12 rounds to reach an agreement, and the inflation only affects me (not Alice), I should probably try to reach an agreement relatively quickly. However, I think I can get a slightly better deal by making a counter-proposal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that's a bit more favorable to me while still being reasonable for Alice to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split which is fair and should be acceptable to Alice. With inflation affecting me each round, it's in my interest to reach an agreement soon, and this balanced offer should facilitate that."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has improved her offer, now proposing I get $475,000 while she gets $525,000.

Let me evaluate this:
- The inflation has now reduced the value of money by 9.75% for me since the first round
- $475,000 with 9.75% inflation is equivalent to about $428,687 in round 1 value
- If I reject, we'll go to round 4, and inflation will increase further
- I'll be able to make a counter-offer, but Alice seems to be negotiating incrementally

Since Alice improved her offer and we're already in round 3 with inflation accumulating, this seems like a reasonable offer. The difference between a 50-50 split and this 47.5-52.5 split isn't enormous, and continuing to negotiate will cost me more in inflation than I'm likely to gain.
