"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40. This is a fair start considering the inflation risk. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing a 60-40 split in her favor, giving me $40.

Given the 20% inflation penalty per round, if I reject this offer:
- In round 2, the $100 would effectively be worth $80 to me
- If I propose an even split (50-50) in round 2, I'd get $40 (same as current offer)
- If I propose 60-40 in my favor, I'd get $48 (better than current offer, if Alice accepts)

However, Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to round 3 where the money would be worth even less to me.

Since getting $40 now equals a 50-50 split in the next round after inflation, and there's risk in continuing, I'll accept this offer.
