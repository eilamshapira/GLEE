"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I must evaluate the offer considering the impact of inflation on my potential gains.

*   **My perspective (Alice):** The money's value is already 20% less. While I didn't get anything in the first round, rejecting Bob's offer means the money will be worth even less in the next round. Accepting now is better, so I should accept the offer.
