"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's start with a fair split. I propose 55 for me and 45 for you. This is a good starting point, and avoids the risk of inflation eroding our potential gains in later rounds. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer carefully. 

Alice is offering me $45 out of $100, taking $55 for herself. If I reject this offer, I'll get to make a counter-offer in the next round, but the money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation. This means the $100 will effectively be worth only $80 to me in the next round.

If I accept now, I get $45. If I reject, I might be able to negotiate for more than 50% of the $80 value in the next round, but there's risk involved.

Given the significant inflation penalty and the reasonable initial offer, I think accepting is the better choice.
