"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I must consider the effects of inflation on my potential gains. While Bob's offer seems tempting at first glance, I have to account for the devaluation of the money.

If I accept this offer:

*   **Alice's gain (Nominal):** $400,000
*   **Alice's gain (Real Value - accounting for 5% inflation from Round 1):** $400,000 * (1 - 0.05) = $380,000

In comparison with my previous offer, this is a bad trade. The money I get is reduced in value.

Therefore, I will **reject** the offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, it's round 3. I need to be more aggressive to secure a decent outcome, considering the ongoing inflation that affects me.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 650000,
  ""bob_gain"": 350000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze Bob's offer in Round 4.

*   **Alice's Gain (Nominal):** $350,000
*   **Alice's Gain (Real Value - accounting for the cumulative inflation from Round 1. Inflation is 5% per round):** $350,000 * (1 - 0.05)^3 = $350,000 * (0.95)^3 = $350,000 * 0.857375 = $300,081.25

My previous offer was slightly better than this one, considering inflation and the number of rounds. So I'll reject again to try and secure a better deal.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Alright, it's Round 5. The value of the money I receive is decreasing significantly with each passing round. I have to adjust my strategy to reflect this and secure a deal before the value diminishes too much.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 620000,
  ""bob_gain"": 380000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's evaluate Bob's offer in Round 6, considering the effect of inflation:

*   **Alice's Gain (Nominal):** $300,000
*   **Alice's Gain (Real Value):** $300,000 * (1 - 0.05)^5 = $300,000 * (0.95)^5 = $300,000 * 0.77378 = $232,134

This offer gives me a very small amount in real value. I'll reject it.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, it's round 7. The situation is getting critical, and the value of the money is dropping rapidly. I need to try and secure a more favorable outcome.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's break down Bob's offer in Round 8.

*   **Alice's Gain (Nominal):** $250,000
*   **Alice's Gain (Real Value):** $250,000 * (1 - 0.05)^7 = $250,000 * (0.95)^7 = $250,000 * 0.698337 = $174,584.25

The real value I would receive is quite low. Given the rounds remaining, I'm likely to get a better deal making an offer and making it now. I will reject this offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","We are in round 9, and the pressure is on. The effects of inflation are starting to severely impact the value I'll receive. I need to make an offer that is likely to be accepted.

Here is my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze Bob's offer in Round 10:

*   **Alice's Gain (Nominal):** $200,000
*   **Alice's Gain (Real Value):** $200,000 * (1 - 0.05)^9 = $200,000 * (0.95)^9 = $200,000 * 0.630249 = $126,049.8

My real value has diminished greatly due to inflation, but I'm close to the final round. If I reject, I risk ending up with nothing. This is a crucial moment, and I need to make a decision that gives me a positive outcome even if it's not ideal. Because I have so few rounds left, I will accept it.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, round 11. This is it, almost the final round. The value of the money I can receive is really, really low. I have to make an offer Bob is most likely to accept.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000
}
```"
