5400.0,4600.0,"Alice, I value a quick resolution. My share loses 10% value each round, so waiting isn't in my best interest. To keep things efficient and still fair, I propose $4600 for me and $5400 for you. I hope this deal acknowledges both our interests and saves us further lossesâ€”let's settle now!",Bob,2,
