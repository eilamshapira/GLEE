Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I value a quick resolution. My share loses 10% value each round, so waiting isn't in my best interest. To keep things efficient and still fair, I propose $4600 for me and $5400 for you. I hope this deal acknowledges both our interests and saves us further lossesâ€”let's settle now! 
# Alice gain: 5400 
# Bob gain: 4600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
