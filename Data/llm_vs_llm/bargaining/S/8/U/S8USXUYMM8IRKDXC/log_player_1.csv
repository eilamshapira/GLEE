"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, considering I'm making the first move and taking initiative in starting our negotiation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be fair. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  This accounts for the time value of money, as we move into the next round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $45, but it's worth 5% less due to inflation, so effectively $42.75
- If I reject, we go to next round where I can make a new offer, but any amount will be worth another 5% less
- Bob seems reasonable with a relatively fair split
- The difference between my initial offer (60) and his counter (45) isn't extreme
- Further negotiation might lead to diminishing returns due to inflation

Given that Bob has made a reasonable offer and inflation will continue to eat into the value, I'll accept.
