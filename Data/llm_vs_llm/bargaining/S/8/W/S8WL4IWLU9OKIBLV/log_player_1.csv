Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Let's see how the math works out with inflation and why rejecting is the better choice:

* **Bob's Offer:**
    * Alice gets $400,000, but due to inflation, it's worth 20% less: $400,000 * 0.8 = $320,000
    * Bob gets $600,000 (unaffected by Alice's inflation).

* **Why Rejecting is Better** 
    * Bob's offer heavily favors him. 
    * I'm willing to take a slight hit in later rounds to get a fairer deal. It's better to negotiate than accept a bad offer early on. 
 
Let's aim for a more equitable split in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}
``` 

Let's break down my reasoning:

* **Inflation Impact:** The money I gain this round is worth 40% less than in Round 1.
* **Finding a Balance:** I've reduced my demand slightly from Round 1,  but it's still a strong offer considering the inflation working against me. 
* **Bob's Perspective:** Bob likely sees that a 50/50 split will be less appealing to me as time goes on.  This offer gives him a chance to secure a decent sum.

Hopefully, Bob will accept this time."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob is getting bolder, but his offer still isn't good enough. Here's why:

* **My Real Gain:** With inflation, $450,000 is now worth only $230,400 to me ($450,000 * 0.512).
* **The Trend:** Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation working against me. Each round, his offer gets slightly better for him.  
* **Time Pressure:** While we're not critically low on time yet, I need to show Bob I'm serious about getting a fair share. 

I'll hold out for a better offer."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

Here's my thinking:

* **Strategic Compromise:**  I've come down a bit from my previous offer, acknowledging the time pressure and inflation. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Still Favoring Myself:**  While a compromise, this offer still secures me a larger portion of the money. This is crucial because of the inflation working against me.
* **Testing Bob's Greed:** This offer tests whether Bob is willing to accept a reasonable deal or if he'll continue pushing for an increasingly larger share.

Let's hope Bob sees this as a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Finally! A reasonable offer. While a 50/50 split seemed unfair earlier, considering the significant inflation working against me, this is now the best I'm likely to get.  

Accepting now secures me a decent amount before inflation eats away even more of my potential gains."
