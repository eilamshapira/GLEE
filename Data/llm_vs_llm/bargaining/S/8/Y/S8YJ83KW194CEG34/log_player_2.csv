"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

If I accept now, I get $4,000. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but due to 10% inflation, the total pot is effectively worth $9,000 to me.

While $4,000 isn't quite a fair split, rejecting means I'm gambling that I can secure a better deal despite:
1. The inflation penalty
2. The risk of further rounds of negotiation
3. The possibility of getting nothing if we don't agree in 12 rounds

Given that this is just round 1 and I have room to negotiate for a better deal even with inflation, I'll reject this somewhat unfair split.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me make a more balanced offer, but still accounting for my position.

I'll propose a more equitable split while considering that:
1. If Alice rejects, the next round will be worth 10% less to me
2. Alice might be more likely to accept a fair offer
3. We need to reach agreement within 12 rounds

I'll propose a 50-50 split, which is fair and harder to argue against:

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

This is a fair division that gives us both equal shares. It's a reasonable improvement from Alice's initial offer that favored her significantly."
