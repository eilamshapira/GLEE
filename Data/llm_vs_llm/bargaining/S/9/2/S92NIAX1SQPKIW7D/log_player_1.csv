"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split that slightly favors me since I'm making the first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this 55-45 split as a reasonable starting point that gives both of us a substantial amount while maintaining fairness. The slight advantage to me reflects my position as the first mover, but it's not so unfair that Bob would likely reject it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer since we still have many rounds left to negotiate, and Bob has simply reversed my initial proposal. Let me try to make a more enticing offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a perfectly equal split to demonstrate fairness and increase chances of acceptance:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose this 50-50 split as it's completely fair to both parties. There's no rational reason to reject an equal division, and we should both walk away satisfied rather than risk getting nothing if we can't reach an agreement within the remaining rounds."
