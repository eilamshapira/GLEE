60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This seems fair considering we both want to maximize our gains, and we should aim to agree quickly due to inflation affecting the total value. If we go to another round, I'll only get 90% of my share's value, so it's in both our interests to settle now.",Alice,1,
