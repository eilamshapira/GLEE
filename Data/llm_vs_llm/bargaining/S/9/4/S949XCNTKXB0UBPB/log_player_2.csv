"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This seems fair considering we both want to maximize our gains, and we should aim to agree quickly due to inflation affecting the total value. If we go to another round, I'll only get 90% of my share's value, so it's in both our interests to settle now. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's offering me $40 out of $100, while taking $60 for herself. If I reject, we move to the next round where I can make a counter-offer, but the total money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation (so the $100 would effectively be worth only $80 to me).

If I reject and propose a better split for myself in the next round, Alice might reject my offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation, reducing the overall value even more for me.

Given that I get to keep a substantial portion ($40) without risking further devaluation, and considering the uncertainty about how inflation affects Alice, accepting this offer seems reasonable.
