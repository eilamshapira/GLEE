Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I think a more equitable division would be better for both of us. I'm offering you the majority at 55%, but with a more balanced split. Remember that with each round, inflation affects me by 20%, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
