"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a decent piece to start with. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing to give me $100,000 out of the $1,000,000, which is 10% of the total. 

If I reject, I'll get to make a counter-offer in the next round, but the money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation. This means the effective total value to me would be $800,000 in the next round.

While $100,000 is a substantial amount, it seems quite low compared to the total. Since this is just the first round and I have the opportunity to make a counter-offer next, I'll reject this offer to try for a better division.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I need to make a reasonable counter-offer. The money is now worth 20% less to me, but I still want to get a fair share while making an offer Alice might accept.

{""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""Alice, I think a more equitable division would be better for both of us. I'm offering you the majority at 55%, but with a more balanced split. Remember that with each round, inflation affects me by 20%, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. My offer is more balanced and gives us both a decent amount.  Time is running out! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate this offer. Alice is now offering me $400,000, which is 40% of the total. This is a significant improvement from her first offer of only $100,000.

Due to inflation, the money is now worth 36% less to me than in the first round. So the effective value of the $400,000 to me would be:
$400,000 × (1 - 0.36) = $400,000 × 0.64 = $256,000

If I reject and we move to the next round, the inflation would increase to around 49% (0.8^3 = 0.512, so 48.8% less), and I'd need to make a new offer.

Alice's offer has improved substantially, and the inflation penalty is getting significant. Given that we have a limited number of rounds and the inflation keeps accumulating, this seems like a reasonable offer to accept.
