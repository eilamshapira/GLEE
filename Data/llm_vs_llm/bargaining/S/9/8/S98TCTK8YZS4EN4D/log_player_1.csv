"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly and end the game early!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to be generous, but let's make it worthwhile for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, I need to consider that when evaluating Bob's offer.

Bob's offer: Alice gain = $5200, but due to 10% inflation, it's worth $5200 * 0.9 = $4680 to me.

Considering this, I think I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less now, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself.

Due to two rounds of inflation, the money I gain is worth 10% less each round, so it's worth 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 of the original value.
The money Bob gains is worth 20% less each round, so it's worth 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 of the original value.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 6500, 
""bob_gain"": 3500, 
""message"": ""Let's end the game before the money loses more value!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair offer considering the inflation. Let's end this now. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 27.1% less, I need to consider that when evaluating Bob's offer.

Bob's offer: Alice gain = $5000, but due to 27.1% inflation, it's worth $5000 * 0.729 = $3645 to me.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is actually quite fair, given the significant decrease in value for both of us.
