"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm proposing a more balanced split that gives you a substantial amount while being fair to me as well. I face 5% inflation per round, so time is valuable. This is a reasonable offer that benefits us both without unnecessary delays. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
