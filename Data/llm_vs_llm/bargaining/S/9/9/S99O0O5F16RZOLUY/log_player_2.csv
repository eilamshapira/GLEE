"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, but I need the majority of the money to make sure we both get something in the end. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. Alice is asking for 90% of the money ($900,000) and offering me only 10% ($100,000).

With 5% inflation per round for me, if I reject and we continue to round 2, the total value will be worth $950,000 to me. If I make a counter-offer that Alice rejects, by round 3 the money would be worth about $902,500 to me, and so on.

This first offer seems quite unbalanced in Alice's favor. While I don't know how inflation affects Alice, I believe I can propose a more equitable split in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer that acknowledges the inflation pressure while being fair to both of us.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I'm proposing a more balanced split that gives you a substantial amount while being fair to me as well. I face 5% inflation per round, so time is valuable. This is a reasonable offer that benefits us both without unnecessary delays.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. This offer ensures we both receive a significant portion, and it's more equitable than your previous proposal. Let's avoid further delays and finalize this split. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me evaluate this offer carefully.

Alice is now offering me $400,000 (40%) and taking $600,000 (60%).

Due to inflation, this $400,000 is worth 9.75% less to me than it would have been in round 1, so its effective value to me is about $361,000.

I've also learned that Alice faces 19% inflation since round 1, so her $600,000 is effectively worth about $486,000 to her.

This offer is much more balanced than her first one, and now I understand that Alice has even higher inflation pressure than I do. If we continue, both our shares will be worth less. Given that Alice faces higher inflation, it makes sense why she's now willing to offer me a larger portion.
