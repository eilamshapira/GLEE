"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to calculate the impact of inflation on my perspective. Since the original $10,000 is now worth 5% less to me, in terms of its original value, my gain would be worth:

*   $5000 is worth $5000 * (1 - 0.05) = $4750 in original value

I see that I would gain $4750, but since I was hoping to make more, I will *reject* the offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 3, taking inflation into account. My money is now worth another 5% less than in round 1, so the money is worth 10% less overall.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
