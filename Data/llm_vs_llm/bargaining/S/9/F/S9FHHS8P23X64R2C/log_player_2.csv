"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me after each round, I'll make a fair offer. 
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value I'd get is less than the nominal value. 
For me, the $4500 is worth approximately $4500 * 0.9075 = $4083.75.
Still, it's a better offer than the previous one from Alice.
