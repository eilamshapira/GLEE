700000.0,300000.0,"Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer ensures you get a decent amount right away.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I understand we both want to finish this quickly. Since you face higher inflation (20% vs my 5%), it makes sense to agree soon. This is a fair offer that accounts for our different situations - you get almost half now rather than risking greater losses through inflation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, my offer is still the most reasonable.  We're both losing money as time passes. Let's be pragmatic and close this deal.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, inflation is severely impacting both of us, but especially you. You've already lost 36% of value while I've only lost 9.75%. If we continue to round 5, you'll lose nearly 50% of the original value. This offer gives you $400000 now, which is worth significantly more than what you'd get after more rounds of inflation. Let's end this reasonably and avoid further devaluation.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, this back and forth is pointless.  Let's stop wasting time and settle this. Take this offer, it's the best you'll get.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"Alice, the inflation rates are severely affecting your position. You've already lost nearly 60% of value while I've only lost about 19%. If we continue to round 7, you'll lose over 67% of the original value. This $350000 for you now is worth more than what you'd get after another round of inflation. Given our different inflation rates, this is actually becoming a more equitable split in real terms. Let's finalize this deal now before you lose even more value.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I'm giving you one last chance to be reasonable.  This offer is fair considering the circumstances.  Let's end this now before we both lose even more.",Alice,7,
