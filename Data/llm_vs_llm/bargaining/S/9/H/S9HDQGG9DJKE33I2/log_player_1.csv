Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand we both want to finish this quickly. Since you face higher inflation (20% vs my 5%), it makes sense to agree soon. This is a fair offer that accounts for our different situations - you get almost half now rather than risking greater losses through inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, inflation is severely impacting both of us, but especially you. You've already lost 36% of value while I've only lost 9.75%. If we continue to round 5, you'll lose nearly 50% of the original value. This offer gives you $400000 now, which is worth significantly more than what you'd get after more rounds of inflation. Let's end this reasonably and avoid further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the inflation rates are severely affecting your position. You've already lost nearly 60% of value while I've only lost about 19%. If we continue to round 7, you'll lose over 67% of the original value. This $350000 for you now is worth more than what you'd get after another round of inflation. Given our different inflation rates, this is actually becoming a more equitable split in real terms. Let's finalize this deal now before you lose even more value. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000
