"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it fairly, with a slight advantage to me for going second. This ensures we both benefit from a quick resolution. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Bob is offering me $4500, while he would get $5500. However, due to inflation affecting him, his $5500 is actually worth $4950 to him (10% less).

This means in real value terms:
- I would get: $4500
- Bob would get: $4950

While this is still slightly in Bob's favor, it's a reasonable offer and continuing to another round might lead to further value loss for both of us. The difference isn't large enough to justify rejecting and risking a worse outcome.
