"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, 60/40 seems reasonable 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Alice's offer of a 60/40 split, where I would get $4,000 and she would get $6,000.

Let me think about this carefully. If I reject this offer, I'll get to make a counter-offer in the next round, but due to inflation, the money will be worth 20% less to me. That means the total value to me would decrease to $8,000 equivalent. Even if I proposed a very favorable split for myself in the next round, the maximum I could get would be $8,000, which is already less than the total value now.

The $4,000 offered now is half of what the total would be worth to me in the next round. So unless I'm confident I can get significantly more than 50% in the next round, it's better to accept now.
