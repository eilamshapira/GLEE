"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly and avoid inflation losses 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which is generally considered fair
2. I'm not affected by inflation, so waiting for future rounds doesn't give me any advantage
3. Alice is suggesting we avoid inflation losses, which might imply she is affected by inflation
4. Getting $50 now is a solid, guaranteed outcome
5. If I reject, I could propose a higher split in my favor, but Alice might reject and the subsequent inflation could make her less likely to accept later offers

Given these considerations, a guaranteed $50 is a reasonable outcome, and there's risk in rejecting for potentially marginal gain.
