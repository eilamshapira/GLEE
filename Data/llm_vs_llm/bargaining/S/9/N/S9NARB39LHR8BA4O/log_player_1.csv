I'm going to be greedy and take the majority of the money, but leaving Bob with something to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```
I'm going to reject this offer. Even though my share is worth less due to inflation, I still believe I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly again, but hopefully this is enough to entice Bob to accept."
