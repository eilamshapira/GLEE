"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a split that considers the different inflation rates affecting both players. Since I (Alice) face higher inflation (10% per round) compared to Bob's 5%, I should aim for a fair but slightly advantageous first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

This offer gives Bob a substantial amount while accounting for my higher inflation risk. It's a reasonable starting point that shows respect for both parties' interests."
