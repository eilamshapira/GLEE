"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me 4500$ out of 10,000$
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, my money will be worth less next round
4. The offer is slightly in Alice's favor, but not extremely unfair

While I could try to negotiate for a better deal, the 5% inflation penalty means I'd need to secure significantly more to make up for the loss in value. The current offer of 4500$ is reasonable enough that it might be better to accept now rather than risk further negotiations.
