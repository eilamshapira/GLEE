"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, for round 1 I propose an equal split: $50 for you and $50 for me. Accepting now ensures we both secure the full value before inflation cuts in for me. Looking forward to your thoughts!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer in the first round. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor for round 2.  Let's settle this quickly and avoid further impact from inflation.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your proposal. Given that further rounds will reduce my shareâ€™s real value even more, I accept your offer of $40 for me and $60 for you in round 2. Looking forward to concluding our agreement!""}"
