"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a fair 50-50 split. While you asked for 90%, that's far from equitable. My money is affected by 20% inflation per round, so this even split is reasonable. We can both walk away with a substantial amount without dragging this out. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
