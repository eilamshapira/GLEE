"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take 90%, you get 10% 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I take only 10% of the money ($100,000) while she takes 90% ($900,000). This doesn't seem like a fair division at all.

If I reject this offer, I can make my own proposal in the next round. However, I need to be mindful of the 20% inflation per round which affects my portion. Even with inflation, making a counter-offer that gives me more than $100,000 after inflation would be better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced offer that accounts for the inflation effect while still being fair to both of us.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. While you asked for 90%, that's far from equitable. My money is affected by 20% inflation per round, so this even split is reasonable. We can both walk away with a substantial amount without dragging this out.""}"
