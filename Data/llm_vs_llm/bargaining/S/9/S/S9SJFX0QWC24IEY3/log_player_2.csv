"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. This is a fair 50-50 split of the $1,000,000
2. However, if I reject, in the next round I can make a counter-offer
3. But due to 20% inflation, the $500,000 would only be worth $400,000 to me in the next round
4. Even if I try to negotiate for more in round 2, any gains might be offset by the inflation loss
5. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush

Given the inflation penalty and the risk of further negotiations reducing the total value, this seems like a reasonable first offer.
