"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly, Bob. I believe a 60/40 split is a good starting point for us to negotiate. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing I get $40 while she gets $60. Since there's no inflation penalty for me mentioned (0% less each round), I don't lose value by negotiating further. This gives me the opportunity to counter with a better offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced counter-offer.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I think a 50/50 split would be the fairest approach since we're both equal participants in this game. This way we both walk away with the same amount, which seems most equitable.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the offer of a 50/50 split, but with inflation impacting my gains each round, that becomes less fair to me as time goes on. Let's compromise with a 55/45 split. It's closer to your offer, but acknowledges the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I now understand that Alice is facing inflation that affects her gains (19% less value by round 3), while I'm not affected by inflation. This explains why she's keen to reach an agreement sooner. Her new offer gives me $45 while she gets $55, which is better than her initial offer of $40/$60.

Since I don't lose value by waiting, I could negotiate further, but I should also consider that if we reach round 12 without agreement, we both get nothing. Alice has moved $5 in my direction from her original offer, showing willingness to compromise.
