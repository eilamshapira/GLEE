Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. I'm considering inflation here. You get 4500, and I get 5500. This is a reasonable split, considering the money is worth less for both of us with each round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
