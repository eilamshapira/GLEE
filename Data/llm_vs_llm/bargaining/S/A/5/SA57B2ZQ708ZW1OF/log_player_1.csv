"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the situation. Due to inflation, the $100 is now worth less to me.

Given Bob's offer:

*   Alice gain: 45
*   Bob gain: 55

And considering the inflation, I need to decide if 45 is worth more to me than potentially making a better offer in the future.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand. It's Round 3, and I need to make a new offer. The money is now worth less to me due to inflation from the previous two rounds.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to evaluate Bob's offer, taking into account the accumulated inflation. In this round, the value of the money for me has decreased by 27.1% compared to round 1.

Bob's Offer:
*   Alice gain: 50
*   Bob gain: 50

I need to decide if the value of $50 now is better than the potential of future rounds, considering the money's worth is decreasing.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, it's Round 5, and I need to make a new offer. The money is now worth significantly less to me due to inflation. I'll try to make an offer that is more appealing than the last few rounds.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 52,
""bob_gain"": 48
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 52 
# Bob gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I'm evaluating Bob's offer. The inflation has now made the money significantly less valuable for me. I need to consider how much the initial $100 is worth now compared to how much Alice will get.

Bob's Offer:
*   Alice gain: 52
*   Bob gain: 48

I think that accepting this will be more advantageous since the next round, with the inflation, will decrease the value significantly.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
