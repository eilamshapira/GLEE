Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a fair 50-50 split. This is equitable for both of us. Remember that with each round we both lose value due to inflation, so it's in our mutual interest to reach an agreement soon. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
