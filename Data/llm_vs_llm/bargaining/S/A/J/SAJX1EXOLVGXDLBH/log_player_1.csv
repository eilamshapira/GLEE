# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob's offer gives me $45 and him $55 (which is worth 5% less to him due to inflation), I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, Bob's $55 is now worth 5% less again, so it's worth approximately $50.75 to him (55 * 0.95 * 0.95). I'll try to make a more appealing offer.

""bob_gain"": 48, 
""message"": ""Better deal for both, considering inflation""}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering inflation, meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 47 
# Bob gain: 53 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob's offer gives me $47 and him $53, but his $53 is worth approximately 45.74 to him due to inflation (53 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95), I'll consider it.
