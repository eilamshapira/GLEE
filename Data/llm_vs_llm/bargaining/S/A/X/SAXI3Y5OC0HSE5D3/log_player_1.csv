"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer to divide the $1,000,000. Since we're in Round 1 and inflation will reduce the value in future rounds, I should propose a fair split that Bob would likely accept.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering a split where I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000. This is fairly balanced while giving me slightly more, recognizing that inflation affects me more severely (20% vs 5%) in future rounds, which incentivizes both of us to conclude the deal now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this carefully. Bob rejected my initial offer and has now proposed a reversed split where I get $450,000 and he gets $550,000.

If I reject this offer and we go to round 3, the inflation will further reduce the value of the money for both of us - by 20% for me and 5% for Bob. This means if I make a new offer in round 3, the actual value would be even less for both of us.

For me, $450,000 in round 2 is worth $450,000 * 0.8 = $360,000 in round 1 terms.
If I reject and get, say, $500,000 in round 3, it would be worth $500,000 * 0.8 * 0.8 = $320,000 in round 1 terms.

Since the value of my share decreases more rapidly than Bob's due to the different inflation rates, accepting now is likely better than continuing negotiation.
