,,,Bob,1,reject
250000.0,750000.0,"Alice, given that delaying costs you more than me (20% vs 10% per round), my round‐2 proposal is a 75/25 split in my favor. This offer secures you 250000 nominal dollars (worth 0.8×250000 = 200000 in current value) – which is at least as good as you’d expect by waiting. I believe this is a fair and efficient settlement for both of us. What do you say?",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, it's my turn to make a counter-offer. I'm willing to accept a 60/40 split in my favor.  This takes into account the inflation affecting us both, and ensures we both get a decent share. What do you say?",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
800000.0,200000.0,"Alice, I know that if you wait until round 5 as the proposer, you'll secure almost the entire pie—but at a further discount (your money will then be worth only about 40.96% of its original value). To avoid further erosion, I'm offering you 800000 nominal dollars now (which comes to 800000×0.512 = 409600 in present value for you), matching what you'd expect if you waited. Let's settle now to preserve as much value as possible for both of us.",Bob,4,
