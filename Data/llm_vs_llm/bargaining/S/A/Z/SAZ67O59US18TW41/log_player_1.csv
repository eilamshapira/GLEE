Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, given that delaying costs you more than me (20% vs 10% per round), my round‐2 proposal is a 75/25 split in my favor. This offer secures you 250000 nominal dollars (worth 0.8×250000 = 200000 in current value) – which is at least as good as you’d expect by waiting. I believe this is a fair and efficient settlement for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know that if you wait until round 5 as the proposer, you'll secure almost the entire pie—but at a further discount (your money will then be worth only about 40.96% of its original value). To avoid further erosion, I'm offering you 800000 nominal dollars now (which comes to 800000×0.512 = 409600 in present value for you), matching what you'd expect if you waited. Let's settle now to preserve as much value as possible for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000
