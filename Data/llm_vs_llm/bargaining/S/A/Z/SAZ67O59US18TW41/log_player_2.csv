Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 750000, ""alice_gain"": 250000, ""message"": ""Alice, given that delaying costs you more than me (20% vs 10% per round), my round‐2 proposal is a 75/25 split in my favor. This offer secures you 250,000 nominal dollars (worth 0.8×250,000 = 200,000 in current value) – which is at least as good as you’d expect by waiting. I believe this is a fair and efficient settlement for both of us. What do you say?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's my turn to make a counter-offer. I'm willing to accept a 60/40 split in my favor.  This takes into account the inflation affecting us both, and ensures we both get a decent share. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4

To avoid further erosion, I'm offering you 800,000 nominal dollars now (which comes to 800,000×0.512 = 409,600 in present value for you), matching what you'd expect if you waited. Let's settle now to preserve as much value as possible for both of us.""}"
