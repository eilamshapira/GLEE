"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer for the division of $10,000. Since we're in the first round, I need to consider that if Bob rejects, we'll move to the next round where the money loses 5% of its value for me.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose a slightly favorable split for me, but still offering Bob a substantial amount. This is a fair offer considering the inflation risk I face if we move to additional rounds."
