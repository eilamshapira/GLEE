"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","For my first offer, I'll propose a fair and equal split.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose we split the money equally - $500,000 each. This is fair to both of us, and we can avoid the risk of inflation reducing the total value in future rounds."
