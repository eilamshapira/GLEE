Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since we're both participating equally in this negotiation, I think a 50-50 split is most fair. This way we both get an equal share. Keep in mind that with each round, the money becomes worth less to me due to inflation, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50
