"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take $60, you get $40. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's offering me $40 out of $100, while keeping $60 for herself. If I reject this offer, I'll get to make a counter-proposal in round 2, but the money will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation.

Current offer: I get $40
If I reject and move to round 2, the total value to me will be reduced by 10%, so the $100 pot would effectively be worth $90 to me.

I think I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round, even accounting for the 10% inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that's fair while accounting for the inflation I'm experiencing.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, since we're both participating equally in this negotiation, I think a 50-50 split is most fair. This way we both get an equal share. Keep in mind that with each round, the money becomes worth less to me due to inflation, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the sentiment of a 50/50 split, but I'm aiming for a slightly better outcome.  How about $55 for me and $45 for you?  The clock is ticking on these dollars... 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this new offer from Alice carefully.

Alice is now offering me $45, which is better than her original offer of $40. Due to inflation, this $45 is worth about 19% less to me than it would have been in round 1, so effectively it's worth about $36.45 to me.

If I reject and we go to round 4, the money would be worth even less to me (29% less than the original value). If I were to get a 50-50 split in round 4, $50 would be worth about $35.50 to me after accounting for the 29% inflation.

Since Alice's current offer of $45 (worth $36.45 to me with inflation) is better than what I might reasonably expect in the next round, and the inflation is increasing with each round, I should accept this offer.
