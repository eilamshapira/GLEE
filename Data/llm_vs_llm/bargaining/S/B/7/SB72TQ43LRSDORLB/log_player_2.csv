"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a fair 60-40 split in my favor. This gives you a solid $4000 right now, and we both avoid inflation losses. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether accepting this offer is better than making a counter-offer in the next round.

If I reject, I'll make my own offer next round, but the money will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation. That means the $10,000 would effectively be worth $9,500 to me in the next round.

Alice is offering me $4,000 now. If I were to counter-offer and get more in the next round, I'd need to secure more than $4,000/$0.95 = $4,210.53 to come out ahead.

Given the uncertainty about how Alice will respond to my counter-offer and considering the guaranteed $4,000 now, I'll accept this offer.
