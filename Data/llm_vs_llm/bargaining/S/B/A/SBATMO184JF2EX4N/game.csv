60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob! I'm proposing a 60/40 split in this first round, with me getting 60 and you getting 40. Let me know if you're okay with this or if you'd like to make a counteroffer next round. Remember, we both want to avoid inflation reducing our share!",Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, I'm proposing a more balanced division where I get $55 and you get $45. This is closer to an even split and fair for both of us. Since you mentioned inflation, I want us to reach an agreement quickly. This offer gives you a significant portion while acknowledging that a 60/40 split in your favor was too unbalanced. Let me know if this works for you.",Bob,2,
