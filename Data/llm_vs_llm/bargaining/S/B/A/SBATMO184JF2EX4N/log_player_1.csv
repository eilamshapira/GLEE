"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm proposing a 60/40 split in this first round, with me getting 60 and you getting 40. Let me know if you're okay with this or if you'd like to make a counteroffer next round. Remember, we both want to avoid inflation reducing our share!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm proposing a more balanced division where I get $55 and you get $45. This is closer to an even split and fair for both of us. Since you mentioned inflation, I want us to reach an agreement quickly. This offer gives you a significant portion while acknowledging that a 60/40 split in your favor was too unbalanced. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
