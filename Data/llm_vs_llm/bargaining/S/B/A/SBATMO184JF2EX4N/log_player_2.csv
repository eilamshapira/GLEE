"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm proposing a 60/40 split in this first round, with me getting 60 and you getting 40. Let me know if you're okay with this or if you'd like to make a counteroffer next round. Remember, we both want to avoid inflation reducing our share! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Given Alice's offer, I should consider the value and fairness. She's offering me $40 out of $100, which is less than half. There's no inflation for me in future rounds, so I can safely reject this offer without losing value. By rejecting, I'll get to make a counter-offer in the next round where I might secure a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced division and explain my reasoning to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I'm proposing a more balanced division where I get $55 and you get $45. This is closer to an even split and fair for both of us. Since you mentioned inflation, I want us to reach an agreement quickly. This offer gives you a significant portion while acknowledging that a 60/40 split in your favor was too unbalanced. Let me know if this works for you.""}"
