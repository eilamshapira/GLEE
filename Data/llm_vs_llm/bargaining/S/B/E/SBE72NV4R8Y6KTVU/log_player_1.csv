"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this split because I'm accounting for potential future inflation if Bob declines. While a 60-40 split slightly favors me, it's still reasonably fair and should be attractive enough for Bob to consider accepting, avoiding the 5% inflation penalty I would face in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer because even with the 5% inflation penalty, I can still try to negotiate a better deal. The current offer would give me $4,500 (worth $4,275 after 5% inflation), which is significantly less than my initial proposal. I believe there's room for a more balanced split, even accounting for the inflation pressure I'm under."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm adjusting my offer to be more appealing to Bob while still maintaining a favorable position for myself. Since the money is now worth 10% less to me due to two rounds of inflation (but still worth full value to Bob), I need to secure a good enough share to offset this penalty. A 55-45 split is more balanced than my initial offer while still accounting for my inflation disadvantage. The $5,500 I'm asking for would actually be worth $4,950 to me after the 10% inflation, which is reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer because even with the increasing inflation pressure (14.26%), this deal is too unfavorable. The $4,000 offered would actually be worth only about $3,430 to me after inflation, while Bob gets $6,000 at full value. Although I need to be mindful of the increasing inflation and limited rounds, I believe I can still negotiate a better split. We have 8 rounds remaining, and while my negotiating position weakens with each round due to inflation, this current offer is too low to accept."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}

I'm further adjusting my offer to be more appealing to Bob while trying to protect myself from the mounting inflation effect. The money is now worth 19.26% less to me (after 4 rounds of inflation), so my $5,200 would actually be worth about $4,198 to me. This 52-48 split is more balanced than previous offers and acknowledges both the inflation pressure I'm under and Bob's strengthening negotiating position. It's a reasonable compromise that should be attractive enough for Bob to consider accepting, while still giving me enough to offset the significant inflation penalty I'm facing."
