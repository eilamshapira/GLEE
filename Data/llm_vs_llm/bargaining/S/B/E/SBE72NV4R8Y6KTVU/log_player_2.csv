"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically. 

Alice is offering me 4000$ while keeping 6000$ for herself. Given that:
1. With each round, Alice's value decreases by 5%
2. I can make a counter-offer next round
3. Alice's value for her $6000 would decrease to $5700 next round
4. My value stays the same

I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer next round. Alice should be more willing to accept a more balanced split since her money is losing value.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll propose a more balanced split, but still giving Alice a decent portion to make it attractive for her to accept. Given that her money has already depreciated by 5% for this round, she should be more inclined to accept a fair offer now rather than risk further depreciation.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

This is a reasonable offer because:
1. It's more balanced than her initial offer
2. Her 4500$ now is worth more than a slightly higher amount in the next round due to the 5% depreciation
3. It shows I'm willing to be fair while still improving my position from her initial offer"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice has increased my share from her initial offer (4000$ -> 4500$)
2. Her share has decreased (6000$ -> 5500$)
3. Due to inflation, her 5500$ is actually worth only about 4964$ to her (5500$ * 0.9025)
4. If I reject, in the next round her money will be worth even less (about 14.75% less than initial)
5. However, I think I can still get a better deal since she's showing willingness to negotiate

Since my money doesn't lose value and Alice's continues to depreciate, I believe I can get a more favorable split by waiting one more round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that Alice's money has now depreciated by 14.75% from the initial value, I'll make an offer that takes this into account. I want to make it attractive enough for her to accept while improving my position.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

This is a strategic offer because:
1. Due to the 14.75% depreciation, Alice's 4000$ is worth about 3410$ to her
2. If she rejects, her money will be worth even less next round
3. We've already gone through 4 rounds, and with only 8 rounds left, the risk of getting nothing increases
4. She's shown willingness to negotiate by increasing my share in her previous offer
5. This offer gives me a fair majority while still leaving Alice with a significant portion"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice continues to improve my share (from 4500$ -> 4800$)
2. Her 5200$ is now only worth about 4235$ to her (5200$ * 0.8145) due to the 18.55% depreciation
3. If I reject, her money will depreciate by about 23.55% next round
4. We're now 5 rounds in, with 7 rounds left
5. The risk of getting nothing is increasing
6. Alice is showing consistent willingness to negotiate by steadily increasing my share

While I might get a slightly better deal by waiting, the risk is increasing and Alice has made a reasonable offer. Her share is already worth less to her than my share is to me (4235$ vs 4800$). It's time to secure a good deal.
