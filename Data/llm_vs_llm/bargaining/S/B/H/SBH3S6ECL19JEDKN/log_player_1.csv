"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. I want to account for the inflation that will affect me in future rounds. I'll start with a proposal that favors me slightly, but is still hopefully acceptable to Bob.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Even though the split is equal, the money is worth less to me now. However, rejecting this offer means further inflation in the next round. I'll accept this offer to avoid further losses.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
