"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing I get $40 while she gets $60. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation. So the full $100 would be worth only $90 to me in the next round.

If I counter-offer in the next round, I'd need to propose something better than the equivalent of $40 now. Since $40 now equals $44.44 in the next round ($44.44 with 10% inflation equals $40), I would need to ask for more than $44.44 in the next round to improve my position.

I think I can do better by making a counter-offer, so:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I'm making the offer in round 2, I need to be strategic. I should account for the fact that the money is already worth 10% less to me, and I need to consider what Alice might find acceptable to avoid further rounds of inflation.

I'll propose a more balanced split that gives me a bit more than Alice's initial offer, but is still fair enough that she might accept it.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I propose we split the money equally. A 50-50 split is fair to both of us, and by accepting this offer, we both avoid further devaluation of the money."
