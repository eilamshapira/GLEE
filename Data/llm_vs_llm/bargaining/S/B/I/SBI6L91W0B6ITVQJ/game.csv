672750.0,327250.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we split the $1000000 now so that you get $327250 and I get $672750. Given that if you wait until round 2 (your turn to propose) your share would be discounted by 20%, this offer gives you exactly what you’d expect by waiting. I believe this is a fair, efficient deal that avoids further devaluation. What do you say?",Alice,1,

600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Alice, since my share depreciates faster, I think it's fair for me to propose a split where I get $400000 and you get $600000. This way, we both get a significant amount before the value drops too much for me. What do you think?",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
200000.0,800000.0,"Hi Bob, it’s round 3 and time is pressing. Considering that if you decline and make an offer in round 4, your effective payoff will drop further to roughly what $1000000 in round 4 translates to – about $512000 in today’s value – I’m offering you $800000 nominal now (which is worth 0.64 times that, i.e. $512000 in round 1 value) so you get no less than your continuation value. I’m asking for $200000 in return. I believe this deal is fair given our respective depreciation rates and the urgency of the situation. Let’s seal the deal now!",Alice,3,
