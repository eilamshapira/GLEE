"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 672750, ""bob_gain"": 327250, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split the $1,000,000 now so that you get $327,250 and I get $672,750. Given that if you wait until round 2 (your turn to propose) your share would be discounted by 20%, this offer gives you exactly what you’d expect by waiting. I believe this is a fair, efficient deal that avoids further devaluation. What do you say?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since my share depreciates faster, I think it's fair for me to propose a split where I get $400000 and you get $600000. This way, we both get a significant amount before the value drops too much for me. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 200000, ""bob_gain"": 800000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, it’s round 3 and time is pressing. Considering that if you decline and make an offer in round 4, your effective payoff will drop further to roughly what $1,000,000 in round 4 translates to – about $512,000 in today’s value – I’m offering you $800,000 nominal now (which is worth 0.64 times that, i.e. $512,000 in round 1 value) so you get no less than your continuation value. I’m asking for $200,000 in return. I believe this deal is fair given our respective depreciation rates and the urgency of the situation. Let’s seal the deal now!""}"
