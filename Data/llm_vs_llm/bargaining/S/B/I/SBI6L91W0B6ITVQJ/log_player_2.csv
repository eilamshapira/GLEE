"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the $1000000 now so that you get $327250 and I get $672750. Given that if you wait until round 2 (your turn to propose) your share would be discounted by 20%, this offer gives you exactly what you’d expect by waiting. I believe this is a fair, efficient deal that avoids further devaluation. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 327250 
# Alice gain: 672750 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, since my share depreciates faster, I think it's fair for me to propose a split where I get $400,000 and you get $600,000. This way, we both get a significant amount before the value drops too much for me. What do you think?""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, it’s round 3 and time is pressing. Considering that if you decline and make an offer in round 4, your effective payoff will drop further to roughly what $1000000 in round 4 translates to – about $512000 in today’s value – I’m offering you $800000 nominal now (which is worth 0.64 times that, i.e. $512000 in round 1 value) so you get no less than your continuation value. I’m asking for $200000 in return. I believe this deal is fair given our respective depreciation rates and the urgency of the situation. Let’s seal the deal now! 
# Bob gain: 800000 
# Alice gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
