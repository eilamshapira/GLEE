"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 468559, ""bob_gain"": 531441, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal for Round 1: I get $468,559 and you get $531,441. This offer is based on our 12‐round game where your money loses 10% value each round while mine doesn’t. If you reject, you'll have to wait for Round 2 and, by backward‐induction, you can only expect an outcome worth about $531,441 in nominal terms today. Accepting now spares you further value loss. Looking forward to your acceptance!""}"
