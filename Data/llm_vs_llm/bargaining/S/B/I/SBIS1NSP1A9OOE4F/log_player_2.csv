"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal for Round 1: I get $468559 and you get $531441. This offer is based on our 12‐round game where your money loses 10% value each round while mine doesn’t. If you reject, you'll have to wait for Round 2 and, by backward‐induction, you can only expect an outcome worth about $531441 in nominal terms today. Accepting now spares you further value loss. Looking forward to your acceptance! 
# Bob gain: 531441 
# Alice gain: 468559
