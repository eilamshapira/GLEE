"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's settle this quickly. I propose that I receive $600,000 and you get $400,000. Accepting now avoids the 10% depreciation on my share in later rounds. Let's make it fair and efficient for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I believe a 50-50 split is the fairest way to divide the money. This way, we both benefit equally and avoid further depreciation. Let's agree on this and end the game now. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your fair proposal. Given that every additional round results in further depreciation for me (at 10% per round), Iâ€™m better off accepting the 50-50 split now. Let's settle and finalize the agreement.""}"
