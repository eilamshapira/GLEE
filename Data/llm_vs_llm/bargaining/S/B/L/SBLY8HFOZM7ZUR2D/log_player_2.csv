"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering an even 50/50 split of the $100, which would give me $50. This is a fair offer, so there's no strong reason to reject it. If I were to reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total amount would be worth 10% less (only $90 total), which means even if I got a larger percentage, I might end up with less money in absolute terms.
