"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I suggest a fair split where I get slightly more as the first mover. This way we both walk away with a substantial amount without risking value loss due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the 5% inflation after the first round, I propose a slightly higher share for myself. This way, we both still receive a significant amount, but I get a bit more to compensate for the potential future loss in value. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The offer is reasonable given the circumstances. While I get slightly less than what I proposed, accepting now is better than risking further value loss from inflation in subsequent rounds. The 475,000$ is still a substantial amount, and the difference between our shares isn't large enough to justify continuing the negotiation."
