"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Split it evenly, fair deal""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a slightly adjusted split that accounts for the 5% inflation difference. Since the money is worth the same to me in any round but loses 5% value for you each round, this is actually better for you than waiting another round. This is a fair deal considering our different time preferences. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the 5% inflation and the fact that the money loses value for me but not for Bob, I should weigh my options carefully.

Since the original amount was $10,000 and it's now worth 5% less to me, the effective amount I'd get if I were to split it evenly would be less than $5000 for me, but still $5000 for Bob. 

Given Bob's offer of $4500 for me and $5500 for him, and taking into account the inflation, I think this is a reasonable proposal.
