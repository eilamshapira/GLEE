"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it evenly, fair deal 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether a 50-50 split is optimal given our different inflation rates. Since with each round the money value decreases 5% for Alice but remains the same for me, I could potentially get a better deal by going to the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a slightly adjusted split that accounts for the 5% inflation difference. Since the money is worth the same to me in any round but loses 5% value for you each round, this is actually better for you than waiting another round. This is a fair deal considering our different time preferences.""}"
