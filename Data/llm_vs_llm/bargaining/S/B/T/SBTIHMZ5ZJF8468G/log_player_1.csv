"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the inflation.

*   **My gain:** 60% of the original $100, which is $60, is now worth 10% less. So, my gain is effectively worth $60 * 0.90 = $54.
*   **Bob's gain:** 40% of the original $100, which is $40, is now worth 5% less. Bob's gain is effectively worth $40 * 0.95 = $38.

The offer is:

*   **Alice's share:** $45, but worth $45 * 0.90 = $40.50 to me now.
*   **Bob's share:** $55.

I need to decide if $40.50 is better than the possibility of getting nothing, or if I should risk it for a better deal in the next round (where the inflation will hurt me even more). Given the time pressure and the decreasing value of the money, I should probably accept to receive something.
