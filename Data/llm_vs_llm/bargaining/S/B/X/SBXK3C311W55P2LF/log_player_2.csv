"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a fair split: $50 for me and $50 for you. Since every round that passes cuts my effective value by 10%, settling now ensures we both secure as much as possible. I look forward to your agreement! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this logically:

1. The offer is a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 20% inflation for me each round:
   * If I reject and propose next round, my share would need to be at least 62.5$ to equal the current 50$ offer (50/0.8 = 62.5)
   * Alice might not accept such a proposal
4. The current offer gives me 50$ at full value
5. There's risk in rejection as we only have 12 rounds total

Given these factors, accepting now guarantees a fair amount without inflation loss, while rejection could lead to worse outcomes.
