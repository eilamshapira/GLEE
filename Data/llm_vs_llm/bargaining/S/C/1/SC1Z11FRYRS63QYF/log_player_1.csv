"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the inflation affecting my share, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor this round. Let's settle this quickly to minimize our losses. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The reasoning is: Due to 20% inflation, if I reject and try to get a better deal next round, my share would be worth even less. A $40 share now is worth more than a potentially larger share in the next round that would be decreased by at least 20% more. It's better to secure $40 now than risk further devaluation."
