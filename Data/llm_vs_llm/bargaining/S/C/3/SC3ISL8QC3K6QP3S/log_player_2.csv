"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly! I'll take 60 and you get 40. Seems like a good deal to me! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully given the inflation mechanic.

Alice is offering me $40, while taking $60. Since inflation reduces my money's value by 5% each round, if I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount would be worth 5% less to me. However, I could potentially negotiate for more than $40.

Let me consider this: If I reject and propose a more balanced split next round, I might get more even after inflation. For example, if I manage to get $50 in the next round, that would be worth $50 × 0.95 = $47.50 to me, which is better than accepting $40 now.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that acknowledges the inflation pressure while seeking a more balanced split.

{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I'd like to propose a more balanced split. I'll take $55 and you get $45. I'm facing 5% inflation each round, so I need to be mindful of that. This is a fair offer that gives us both a good portion.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Alright, Bob, let's try again. I'll take 55, and you get 45. This is the best I can do, considering my money loses value each round! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this new offer carefully.

Alice is now offering me $45, which is $5 more than her initial offer. Due to inflation, the current $45 offer is worth $45 × (1 - 0.0975) = $40.61 to me in round 1 terms.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 4, I'll face additional inflation (about 15% total from round 1), making any potential gains worth even less. Even if I could negotiate for $50 in round 4, it would be worth approximately $50 × 0.85 = $42.50 to me in round 1 terms.

Given the diminishing value due to inflation and the improved offer from Alice, accepting now seems reasonable rather than continuing negotiations with increasing inflation penalties.
