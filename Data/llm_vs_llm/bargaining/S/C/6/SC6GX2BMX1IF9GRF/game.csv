600000.0,400000.0,Let's split it 60/40. A fair offer to start!,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
200000.0,800000.0,"Alice, consider this: with each round, delays could diminish the future value of your share (and you never know exactly how inflation might hit you). I’m offering you $200000 now versus risking less later. Let's not waste time—accept this proposal and secure your gain.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Okay Bob, I understand your point about inflation. I'll be reasonable. I'm proposing 55/45.  This is still a good deal for both of us, given that my part of the money now worth 5% less!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"Alice, time is money—literally. With each passing round, inflation eats away at the real value of your share while mine remain unaffected. Although I know you’re aiming for a 55/45 split, further delay will only leave you with less in real terms. I'm offering you $300000 now, a guarantee against additional value loss. Accepting today secures your best outcome before the discount deepens.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Bob, this is my final offer. 50/50. The inflation is killing me. We both get half, and we're done. Otherwise, we'll keep losing money.",Alice,5,
,,"Alice, while I appreciate the urgency, a 50/50 split doesn’t fully reflect the shifting dynamics of our situation. My share remains unaffected by inflation, while your share continues to diminish further in real value. If we continue, I can propose a division that takes full advantage of this imbalance and helps us both mitigate further losses. I encourage you to reconsider your stance rather than accept a deal that puts you at a relative disadvantage.",Bob,5,reject
150000.0,850000.0,"Alice, the longer we wait the more your share loses real value while mine remains intact. In round 5 you received an offer that, after inflation, left you with roughly the equivalent of $407000—far below its face value. In this round, I'm offering you $150000 now, knowing that if we delay further, you'll end up with even less in actual worth. I urge you to accept this final offer so that you secure the maximum effective benefit possible under these conditions.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Bob, I'm at a serious disadvantage due to inflation. I'm proposing 45/55. This is the absolute lowest I can go, considering the value I'm losing. Think of it as 45% of the original value *after* adjusting for inflation. We need to end this now before there's nothing left for me!",Alice,7,
,,"Alice, I understand your concerns, but a 45/55 split still only gives me $550000 while you’re taking a significant hit from inflation. With your share effectively worth around $330000 today, there's a clear imbalance. I believe we can both secure better outcomes if we adjust the division to reflect the real-time erosion of your share. I’m ready to propose a counteroffer that improves my position further, so let’s push this negotiation a bit more to reach a more efficient split before further losses set in.",Bob,7,reject
100000.0,900000.0,"Alice, the clock is ticking—and with each passing moment, your share dwindles further in real value. At this point, accepting my offer of $100000 guarantees you the best possible outcome under severe inflation; if we delay any longer, you could face even greater losses. I'm offering you a final deal: secure a guaranteed $100000 now rather than risk a rapidly depreciating amount. Let's settle this once and for all.",Bob,8,
