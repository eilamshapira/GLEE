Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, consider this: with each round, delays could diminish the future value of your share (and you never know exactly how inflation might hit you). I’m offering you $200000 now versus risking less later. Let's not waste time—accept this proposal and secure your gain.

# Bob gain: 800000

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Okay, let's try this. Taking the inflation into account, I need to adjust my expectations.

```json

  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Okay Bob, I understand your point about inflation. I'll be reasonable. I'm proposing 55/45.  This is still a good deal for both of us, given that my part of the money now worth 5% less!""
}

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, time is money—literally. With each passing round, inflation eats away at the real value of your share while mine remain unaffected. Although I know you’re aiming for a 55/45 split, further delay will only leave you with less in real terms. I'm offering you $300000 now, a guarantee against additional value loss. Accepting today secures your best outcome before the discount deepens. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Okay, this is getting ridiculous. Bob's playing hardball, but the inflation is *really* hurting me now. I need to factor that in heavily. Let's try to reach a reasonable compromise.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer. 50/50. The inflation is killing me. We both get half, and we're done. Otherwise, we'll keep losing money.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the longer we wait the more your share loses real value while mine remains intact. In round 5 you received an offer that, after inflation, left you with roughly the equivalent of $407000—far below its face value. In this round, I'm offering you $150000 now, knowing that if we delay further, you'll end up with even less in actual worth. I urge you to accept this final offer so that you secure the maximum effective benefit possible under these conditions. 
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is an awful offer, but the inflation is becoming a serious problem. I need to calculate the actual value of the offer and compare it to my potential loss.

Okay, let's think. 150,000, after a 22.62% loss, is worth... roughly 115,000 in round 1 dollars. That's terrible. But what's the alternative? If I reject, I might get even less in the next round. Bob is clearly trying to exploit the inflation to his advantage.

I'm going to take a gamble. A small one. This round.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Okay, this is getting desperate. I need to make a calculation based on the dwindling value of the money for me.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""Bob, I'm at a serious disadvantage due to inflation. I'm proposing 45/55. This is the absolute lowest I can go, considering the value I'm losing. Think of it as 45% of the original value *after* adjusting for inflation. We need to end this now before there's nothing left for me!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the clock is ticking—and with each passing moment, your share dwindles further in real value. At this point, accepting my offer of $100000 guarantees you the best possible outcome under severe inflation; if we delay any longer, you could face even greater losses. I'm offering you a final deal: secure a guaranteed $100000 now rather than risk a rapidly depreciating amount. Let's settle this once and for all. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this. $100,000 with a 30.17% loss means the real value is about $70,000 in round 1 money. That is *terrible*. But the longer I wait, the worse it gets. I'm being squeezed.

This is a terrible situation, but continuing might be even worse. I'm essentially being extorted by the inflation and Bob's unwillingness to be reasonable.

I'm going to swallow my pride and accept this to avoid total loss.
