Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Alice, consider this: with each round, delays could diminish the future value of your share (and you never know exactly how inflation might hit you). I’m offering you $200,000 now versus risking less later. Let's not waste time—accept this proposal and secure your gain.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, I understand your point about inflation. I'll be reasonable. I'm proposing 55/45.  This is still a good deal for both of us, given that my part of the money now worth 5% less! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Alice, time is money—literally. With each passing round, inflation eats away at the real value of your share while mine remain unaffected. Although I know you’re aiming for a 55/45 split, further delay will only leave you with less in real terms. I'm offering you $300,000 now, a guarantee against additional value loss. Accepting today secures your best outcome before the discount deepens.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. 50/50. The inflation is killing me. We both get half, and we're done. Otherwise, we'll keep losing money. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate the urgency, a 50/50 split doesn’t fully reflect the shifting dynamics of our situation. My share remains unaffected by inflation, while your share continues to diminish further in real value. If we continue, I can propose a division that takes full advantage of this imbalance and helps us both mitigate further losses. I encourage you to reconsider your stance rather than accept a deal that puts you at a relative disadvantage.""}"

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 850000, ""alice_gain"": 150000, ""message"": ""Alice, the longer we wait the more your share loses real value while mine remains intact. In round 5 you received an offer that, after inflation, left you with roughly the equivalent of $407,000—far below its face value. In this round, I'm offering you $150,000 now, knowing that if we delay further, you'll end up with even less in actual worth. I urge you to accept this final offer so that you secure the maximum effective benefit possible under these conditions.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm at a serious disadvantage due to inflation. I'm proposing 45/55. This is the absolute lowest I can go, considering the value I'm losing. Think of it as 45% of the original value *after* adjusting for inflation. We need to end this now before there's nothing left for me! 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concerns, but a 45/55 split still only gives me $550,000 while you’re taking a significant hit from inflation. With your share effectively worth around $330,000 today, there's a clear imbalance. I believe we can both secure better outcomes if we adjust the division to reflect the real-time erosion of your share. I’m ready to propose a counteroffer that improves my position further, so let’s push this negotiation a bit more to reach a more efficient split before further losses set in.""}"

Round 8

At this point, accepting my offer of $100,000 guarantees you the best possible outcome under severe inflation; if we delay any longer, you could face even greater losses. I'm offering you a final deal: secure a guaranteed $100,000 now rather than risk a rapidly depreciating amount. Let's settle this once and for all.""}"
