"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair initial offer, but keeping in mind that Bob faces depreciation while I don't.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose this split because it's reasonably fair while acknowledging that Bob might want to decide quickly due to his 5% depreciation per round. This way, I get slightly more but Bob still gets a substantial amount that's worth more now than it would be in later rounds."
