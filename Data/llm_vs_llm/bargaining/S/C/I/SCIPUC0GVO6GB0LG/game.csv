5000.0,5000.0,Let's split the amount equally to ensure a fair deal for both of us!,Alice,1,

4000.0,6000.0,"I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor because our inflation rates differ significantly. You face 20% inflation per round while I only face 5%. This means waiting is much costlier for you than for me. This offer gives you $4000 now, which is better than risking further rounds where your share would depreciate faster than mine. This is a fair adjustment based on our different time preferences.",Bob,2,
