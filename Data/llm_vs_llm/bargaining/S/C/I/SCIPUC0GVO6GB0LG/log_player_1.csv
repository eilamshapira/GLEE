Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split the amount equally to ensure a fair deal for both of us!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor because our inflation rates differ significantly. You face 20% inflation per round while I only face 5%. This means waiting is much costlier for you than for me. This offer gives you $4000 now, which is better than risking further rounds where your share would depreciate faster than mine. This is a fair adjustment based on our different time preferences. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
