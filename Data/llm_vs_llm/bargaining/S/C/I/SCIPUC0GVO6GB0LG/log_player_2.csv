"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the amount equally to ensure a fair deal for both of us! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this carefully since we have different inflation rates.

Alice has proposed a 50-50 split, which appears fair on the surface. However, with each round, my money loses 5% value while Alice's loses 20% value. This means Alice has a stronger incentive to reach an agreement quickly.

If I reject this and make a counter-offer, Alice will face significant depreciation of her potential earnings. This gives me some leverage.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a strategic offer that accounts for our different inflation rates while still being fair enough for Alice to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, 
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor because our inflation rates differ significantly. You face 20% inflation per round while I only face 5%. This means waiting is much costlier for you than for me. This offer gives you $4000 now, which is better than risking further rounds where your share would depreciate faster than mine. This is a fair adjustment based on our different time preferences.""}"
