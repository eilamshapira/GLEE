1.0,99.0,"Alice, every round you wait reduces the value of your share by 20%. If you reject, you'll be proposer in Round 3, but you'll have to face further discounting and I can still extract nearly all of the surplus. In this offer, you get $1 now – better than getting nothing later. Please accept.",Bob,2,

40.0,60.0,"Bob, I understand your point about inflation, but I'm not willing to accept such a low share. I'm offering you a larger portion, but I need to secure a decent amount for myself to make this worthwhile.  Let's find a compromise.",Alice,3,
,,"Alice, while I appreciate your attempt at a compromise, I believe there's more value at stake if we proceed. I can secure a better outcome as the proposer in the next round, ensuring I preserve maximum value. Therefore, I'm rejecting this offer.",Bob,3,reject
1.0,99.0,"Alice, waiting any further will only erode the value of any amount you secure – in the next round your dollars are worth only about 41% of their face value, which leaves you effectively with nothing. I'm offering you $1 now (worth roughly $0.51 to you) instead of the zero you'd likely end up with later. Please accept this division.",Bob,4,
