Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every round you wait reduces the value of your share by 20%. If you reject, you'll be proposer in Round 3, but you'll have to face further discounting and I can still extract nearly all of the surplus. In this offer, you get $1 now – better than getting nothing later. Please accept. 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""Bob, I understand your point about inflation, but I'm not willing to accept such a low share. I'm offering you a larger portion, but I need to secure a decent amount for myself to make this worthwhile.  Let's find a compromise.""}

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, waiting any further will only erode the value of any amount you secure – in the next round your dollars are worth only about 41% of their face value, which leaves you effectively with nothing. I'm offering you $1 now (worth roughly $0.51 to you) instead of the zero you'd likely end up with later. Please accept this division.

# Bob gain: 99
