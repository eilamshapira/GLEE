"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take slightly more this time, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 99, ""alice_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Alice, every round you wait reduces the value of your share by 20%. If you reject, you'll be proposer in Round 3, but you'll have to face further discounting and I can still extract nearly all of the surplus. In this offer, you get $1 now – better than getting nothing later. Please accept.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point about inflation, but I'm not willing to accept such a low share. I'm offering you a larger portion, but I need to secure a decent amount for myself to make this worthwhile.  Let's find a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your attempt at a compromise, I believe there's more value at stake if we proceed. I can secure a better outcome as the proposer in the next round, ensuring I preserve maximum value. Therefore, I'm rejecting this offer.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 99, ""alice_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Alice, waiting any further will only erode the value of any amount you secure – in the next round your dollars are worth only about 41% of their face value, which leaves you effectively with nothing. I'm offering you $1 now (worth roughly $0.51 to you) instead of the zero you'd likely end up with later. Please accept this division.""}"
