Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise. I'll take 55 and you take 45 to account for the inflation affecting us both. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

By offering this, I'm considering the inflation penalty and trying to find a middle ground that benefits both of us more than prolonging the negotiation."
