"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because if you reject, we'll both lose 20% value due to inflation. Let's make a deal now and both walk away with a good amount.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose a 45-55 split in my favor. I believe this is a fair compromise, and it gives you a solid gain while still leaving me a decent amount. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The reasoning behind accepting:
1. With 20% inflation, my $5,500 is actually worth $4,400 (5500 * 0.8)
2. If I reject, we move to round 3 where any amount I get will be worth another 20% less
3. The offer is relatively fair, giving me 55% of the total
4. There's risk in continuing negotiations as the value keeps decreasing
5. Better to secure a good deal now than risk further devaluation"
