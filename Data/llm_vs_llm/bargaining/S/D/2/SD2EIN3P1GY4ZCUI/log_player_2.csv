Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because if you reject, we'll both lose 20% value due to inflation. Let's make a deal now and both walk away with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
