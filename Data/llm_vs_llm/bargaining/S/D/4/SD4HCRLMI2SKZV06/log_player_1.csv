"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60/40 seems reasonable""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, so I propose a 52/48 split in your favor. Let's close this deal and avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll calculate the actual value of the offer.

For me (Alice), the $5200 is worth 5% less, so it's $5200 * 0.95 = $4940.
For Bob, the $4800 is worth 20% less, so it's $4800 * 0.80 = $3840.

Given that the total value is decreasing, I think it's a reasonable offer. I'll accept it to avoid further losses.
