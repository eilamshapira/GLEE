450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm proposing a more balanced split. Since I face 20% inflation per round compared to your 5%, it makes sense for us to agree quickly. This 55/45 split is fair considering our different inflation penalties and gives us both substantial amounts. Let's avoid further devaluation of the total pot.",Bob,2,
