"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm proposing a more balanced split. Since I face 20% inflation per round compared to your 5%, it makes sense for us to agree quickly. This 55/45 split is fair considering our different inflation penalties and gives us both substantial amounts. Let's avoid further devaluation of the total pot. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
