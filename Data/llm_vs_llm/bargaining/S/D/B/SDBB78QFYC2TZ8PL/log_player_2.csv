"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a simple offer: 70% for me, 30% for you.  This makes us both instant millionaires!  Keep in mind the money loses value quickly with each round. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully given the inflation penalty.

Alice is offering me 30% ($300,000) while keeping 70% ($700,000) for herself. If I reject and we go to the next round, I'll face 20% inflation while Alice only faces 5% inflation.

If I reject and make a counter-offer, my $300,000 would be worth only $240,000 to me in the next round. The total pot would effectively be worth less to both of us.

However, since the difference in our shares is quite large (30% vs 70%), and this is the first round, I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that accounts for our different inflation rates while being more equitable.

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm proposing a more balanced split. Since I face 20% inflation per round compared to your 5%, it makes sense for us to agree quickly. This 55/45 split is fair considering our different inflation penalties and gives us both substantial amounts. Let's avoid further devaluation of the total pot.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position on the inflation, but your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor. This is my counter-offer. It's important we reach an agreement soon as the clock is ticking for both of us! 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this new offer considering the inflation penalties that have accumulated.

At this point, the $350,000 Alice is offering me is actually worth only $224,000 to me (36% less than original value) due to inflation over these three rounds. Meanwhile, her $650,000 would be worth about $586,625 to her (9.75% less).

If I reject, we'll go to round 4, where my inflation penalty increases to over 48% while Alice's would be around 14%. The difference in our inflation rates means delays hurt me much more than they hurt Alice.

Although I'd hoped for a more even split, the accelerating inflation differential makes accepting now more favorable than continuing negotiations where my position weakens considerably with each round.
