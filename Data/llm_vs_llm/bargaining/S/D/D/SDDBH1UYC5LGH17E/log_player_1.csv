"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer to divide the $1,000,000. Since I know that inflation will reduce the value of money by 10% each round for me, I want to try to reach an agreement sooner rather than later.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because it gives me a slight advantage while still offering Bob a substantial amount. This is a fair offer that acknowledges both our interests, and accepting now means we can both avoid the effects of inflation on future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob rejected my initial offer and proposed a 50-50 split, I'll make a more balanced offer while still accounting for the inflation effect on my side.

{""alice_gain"": 520000, 
""bob_gain"": 480000}

I propose this slightly adjusted split because it still provides me with some protection against the 10% inflation I'm facing each round, while moving closer to Bob's desired equal split. This compromise acknowledges both of our interests and helps us reach an agreement before inflation erodes my gain further."
