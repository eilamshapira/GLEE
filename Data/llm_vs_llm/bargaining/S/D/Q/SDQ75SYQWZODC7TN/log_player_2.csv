"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer isn't particularly favorable to me, as I'd only get 40% of the money. With inflation reducing the value by 10% each round, I need to consider if it's worth rejecting to make a counter-offer. If I reject now, I can propose in the next round, but the total will be worth 10% less to me.

Let me make a calculated decision.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's first offer, I'll now make a counter-offer that's more favorable to me but still reasonable enough that Alice might accept it. I need to consider that the money is already worth 10% less to me this round due to inflation, and if we keep going back and forth, we'll both lose value.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I suggest a more balanced split where I get a bit more than half. This is fairer than Alice's initial offer while still giving her a substantial portion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I now have important information - Alice is experiencing higher inflation than I am (36% vs my 19% for this round). This means delays hurt her more than they hurt me, which gives me some leverage.

However, her offer of 45/55 is an improvement from her initial 40/60 offer. If I reject, we'll move to round 4, where my inflation will be around 27% and hers likely even higher.

Given that Alice is facing steeper inflation and has improved her offer, plus the fact that we still have many potential rounds ahead where we could both lose significantly more value, I'll accept this offer.
