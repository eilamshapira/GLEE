512820.0,487180.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we split the $1000000 as $512820 for me and $487180 for you. This offer reflects the inevitable 5% reduction per round â€“ by accepting now, you secure nearly 48.7% of the full amount rather than risking further discounting.

By accepting now, you'll secure nearly 48.7% of the full amount, similar to what you suggested. Let's agree on this and avoid the 5% reduction for either of us.",Bob,2,
