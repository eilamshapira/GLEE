"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 512820, ""bob_gain"": 487180, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split the $1,000,000 as $512,820 for me and $487,180 for you. This offer reflects the inevitable 5% reduction per round â€“ by accepting now, you secure nearly 48.7% of the full amount rather than risking further discounting. Let's agree on this fair split and avoid any unnecessary loss.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose we reverse the split you offered, with $512820 for me and $487180 for you. This way, we each get a fair share, but I also need to protect my interests. By accepting now, you'll secure nearly 48.7% of the full amount, similar to what you suggested. Let's agree on this and avoid the 5% reduction for either of us. 
# Alice gain: 487180 
# Bob gain: 512820 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
