"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the $1000000 as $512820 for me and $487180 for you. This offer reflects the inevitable 5% reduction per round â€“ by accepting now, you secure nearly 48.7% of the full amount rather than risking further discounting. Let's agree on this fair split and avoid any unnecessary loss. 
# Bob gain: 487180
