"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, $5000 each. I believe this is reasonable for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer of a 50-50 split.

While it seems fair on the surface, I should remember that if I reject and we go to the next round, there's 10% inflation (so we'd be dividing $9,000 instead of $10,000). However, as Bob, I would get to make the next proposal.

Since this is the first round and Alice's proposal is completely fair, I think it's reasonable to accept. We both get equal amounts, and there's no risk of losing value to inflation.
