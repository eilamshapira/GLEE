"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll play as Alice and make my first offer to divide the $1,000,000. I need to consider that with each passing round, inflation makes the money worth 5% less to me, so there's an incentive to reach an agreement sooner rather than later.

{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000}

I'm offering a slight advantage to myself at 52%, while giving Bob a very substantial 48% of the total. This is close to an even split but acknowledges that I'm making the first move and facing inflation pressure."
