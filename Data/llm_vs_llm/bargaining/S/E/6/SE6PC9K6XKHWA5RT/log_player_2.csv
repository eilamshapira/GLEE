"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $480,000 (48%) while keeping $520,000 (52%)
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 10% less next round for me
3. If I reject, my next proposal would need to be quite attractive to Alice to avoid further rounds
4. The difference between our shares is only $40,000
5. A 48/52 split is fairly reasonable for a first offer
6. Risk of getting nothing after 12 rounds if we can't agree

Given that it's a reasonable first offer and the inflation penalty makes waiting costly for me, I'll accept.
