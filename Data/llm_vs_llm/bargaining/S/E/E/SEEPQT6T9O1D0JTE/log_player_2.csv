"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a generous offer for me, Alice. We can both benefit if we agree quickly. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
- Alice proposes I get $4000 and she gets $6000
- If I reject, in the next round the money will be worth 20% less to me ($8000 equivalent)
- But I'll get to make the next proposal
- The split seems unfavorable to me, as I believe a fair split would be closer to 50-50
- Since this is just round 1 and the inflation penalty isn't too severe yet, I can afford to negotiate

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a more balanced offer:

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. This way we both get an equal share, and with less inflation impact than if we continue negotiating.""}"
