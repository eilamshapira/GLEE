I'm taking a big chunk for myself, but giving Bob a small share to hopefully encourage him to accept.  Let's see what he does."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still feeling confident that I can get a better deal! This inflation is a bit of a pain, but I'm willing to risk one more round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000} 
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still keeping the majority for myself. I believe this is a fair compromise given the inflation we've experienced."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

This is a tough one! I'm losing a lot of money due to inflation, and this offer is really low. However, I'm afraid that if I reject it, Bob might get even greedier in the next round and I'll end up with even less. It's better to take what I can get at this point."
