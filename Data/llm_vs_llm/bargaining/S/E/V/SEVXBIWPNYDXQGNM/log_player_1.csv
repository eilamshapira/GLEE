"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, so I'm proposing a 55/45 split in your favor.  Let's close the deal and avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $5500, but its value will be 20% less than the original value. So, the actual value I'll get is $5500 * 0.8 = $4400.

If I reject this offer, the money will be worth even less in the next round.
