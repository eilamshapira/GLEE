1000000.0,0.0,"Hi Bob, here’s my proposal: I take the entire $1000000 and you get $0. With each round you lose 20% of the value of any money received later, so delaying only hurts your outcome. Please accept this offer now.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Let's split it fairly, I need a good starting point, and you should consider my next offers will be less favorable for you if we keep playing.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
999999.0,1.0,"Bob, I know you’re eager to get a fair deal, but time is extremely costly for you due to the 20% per round inflation penalty. Every moment you wait, your share shrinks further. Accepting even a nominal amount now (which is still more valuable than the nothing you’d get by delaying) is in your best interest. Please, let’s conclude this now.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, considering the inflation penalty, I'm still willing to make a reasonable offer. If we don't agree, the value for me will continue to drop significantly. It's in both our interests to find a mutually acceptable deal now.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, while your offer of $450000 for me might seem like a fair split at first glance, remember that any further rounds will only hurt you more due to the inflation penalty. Since I receive full value with no devaluation and I have the opportunity in the next round to propose a division that better reflects this advantage, I’m going to reject your offer.",Alice,4,reject
199999.0,800001.0,"Bob, here's my proposal: I receive $199999 and you receive $800001. Remember, in round 5, your money is worth only 40.96% of its face value (thanks to the compounded 20% inflation over four rounds), which means if you wait until round 6 as proposer you'll only effectively secure about $327680. My offer gives you a slightly higher effective value, and it avoids further devaluation. Accept now so we can both get the most out of this deal.",Alice,5,
