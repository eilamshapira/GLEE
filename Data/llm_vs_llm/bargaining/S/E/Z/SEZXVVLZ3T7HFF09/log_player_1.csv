"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 1000000, ""bob_gain"": 0, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here’s my proposal: I take the entire $1,000,000 and you get $0. With each round you lose 20% of the value of any money received later, so delaying only hurts your outcome. Please accept this offer now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it fairly, I need a good starting point, and you should consider my next offers will be less favorable for you if we keep playing. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Bob, I know you’re eager to get a fair deal, but time is extremely costly for you due to the 20% per round inflation penalty. Every moment you wait, your share shrinks further. Accepting even a nominal amount now (which is still more valuable than the nothing you’d get by delaying) is in your best interest. Please, let’s conclude this now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the inflation penalty, I'm still willing to make a reasonable offer. If we don't agree, the value for me will continue to drop significantly. It's in both our interests to find a mutually acceptable deal now. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, while your offer of $450,000 for me might seem like a fair split at first glance, remember that any further rounds will only hurt you more due to the inflation penalty. Since I receive full value with no devaluation and I have the opportunity in the next round to propose a division that better reflects this advantage, I’m going to reject your offer.""}"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 199999, ""bob_gain"": 800001, ""message"": ""Bob, here's my proposal: I receive $199,999 and you receive $800,001. Remember, in round 5, your money is worth only 40.96% of its face value (thanks to the compounded 20% inflation over four rounds), which means if you wait until round 6 as proposer you'll only effectively secure about $327,680. My offer gives you a slightly higher effective value, and it avoids further devaluation. Accept now so we can both get the most out of this deal.""}"
