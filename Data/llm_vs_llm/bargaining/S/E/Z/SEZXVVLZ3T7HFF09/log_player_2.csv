"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here’s my proposal: I take the entire $1000000 and you get $0. With each round you lose 20% of the value of any money received later, so delaying only hurts your outcome. Please accept this offer now. 
# Bob gain: 0 
# Alice gain: 1000000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I need a good starting point, and you should consider my next offers will be less favorable for you if we keep playing.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I know you’re eager to get a fair deal, but time is extremely costly for you due to the 20% per round inflation penalty. Every moment you wait, your share shrinks further. Accepting even a nominal amount now (which is still more valuable than the nothing you’d get by delaying) is in your best interest. Please, let’s conclude this now. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Alice, considering the inflation penalty, I'm still willing to make a reasonable offer. If we don't agree, the value for me will continue to drop significantly. It's in both our interests to find a mutually acceptable deal now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, here's my proposal: I receive $199999 and you receive $800001. Remember, in round 5, your money is worth only 40.96% of its face value (thanks to the compounded 20% inflation over four rounds), which means if you wait until round 6 as proposer you'll only effectively secure about $327680. My offer gives you a slightly higher effective value, and it avoids further devaluation. Accept now so we can both get the most out of this deal. 
# Bob gain: 800001 
# Alice gain: 199999
