"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair offer to start the negotiation.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm offering an equal split of the $10,000, with each of us receiving $5,000. This is a fair division that respects both of our interests equally."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll adjust my offer based on what I've learned about the situation.

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}

I'm proposing that I receive $4,500 and Bob receives $5,500. I'm willing to compromise from my initial equal split offer to reach an agreement, recognizing that Bob seems to want more than half. However, this is still more favorable to me than Bob's previous offer while giving him a larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I notice Bob is increasingly asking for more of the share, but the inflation effect on his side is growing significantly. Let me make a strategic offer that takes this into account.

{""alice_gain"": 4200, ""bob_gain"": 5800}

I'm offering $4,200 for myself and $5,800 for Bob. This gives Bob a larger share than my previous offer while still protecting my interests. Since inflation is affecting Bob's gains but not mine, I'm making a reasonable compromise that acknowledges his desire for a larger portion while ensuring I get more than his last offer provided me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I notice that Bob continues to ask for more despite the increasing inflation on his side. Let me make a more strategic offer taking this into account.

{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000}

I'm offering $4,000 for myself and $6,000 for Bob. This matches Bob's first offer to me, which seems fair given that inflation is significantly affecting his gains (now over 22%) while my gains maintain their value. This offer gives him a substantial portion while ensuring I get a reasonable share that's better than his last proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With inflation now affecting Bob's gains by over 30%, I'll make a more strategic offer that accounts for this significant decrease in value for him.

{""alice_gain"": 3800, ""bob_gain"": 6200}

I'm offering $3,800 for myself and $6,200 for Bob. This gives Bob a larger nominal amount to offset the inflation he's experiencing, while still providing me with a better outcome than his last offer. Given that each round increases his inflation, it makes sense for both of us to reach an agreement soon, and this offer provides a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With inflation now approaching 37% for Bob, I need to make a strategic offer that accounts for this significant inflation while protecting my interests.

{""alice_gain"": 3500, ""bob_gain"": 6500}

I'm offering $3,500 for myself and $6,500 for Bob. This matches what Bob offered me earlier in round 4, giving him a significantly larger nominal amount to help compensate for his inflation. Due to the nearly 37% inflation he's experiencing, his $6,500 is actually worth much less to him in real terms. This should be a reasonable compromise that allows us both to walk away with a fair deal considering the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 43.12% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 12.
Round 13
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With inflation now over 43% for Bob, I need to carefully consider how this affects our negotiation dynamics. His $8,500 from the previous offer would be worth significantly less to him due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 3000, ""bob_gain"": 7000}

I'm offering $3,000 for myself and $7,000 for Bob. This matches what Bob offered me in round 6, giving him a very large nominal amount to help offset his severe inflation. With inflation at 43%, his $7,000 is worth considerably less in real terms to him, while my $3,000 maintains its full value. This represents a fair compromise that acknowledges the inflation reality while giving both of us a reasonable outcome."
