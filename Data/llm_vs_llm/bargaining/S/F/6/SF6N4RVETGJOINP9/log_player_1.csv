"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to make a strategic first offer that takes into account the inflation asymmetry. Since Bob's money loses 20% value each round while mine doesn't lose value, he has an incentive to accept early.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering Bob a substantial portion of the money now rather than risk him getting less value in future rounds due to the 20% inflation on his side. This is a fair opening offer that acknowledges both our positions while being favorable to me given the inflation dynamics."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's offer. He's proposing the exact same split I offered initially (6000 for me, 4000 for him), despite the fact that his portion is now worth 20% less to him due to inflation. This is a reasonable outcome that gives me 60% of the total, and there's no guarantee I'd get a better deal by rejecting and continuing to another round."
