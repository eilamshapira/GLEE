"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the effective amount is $10,000 * 0.8 = $8,000. 

To make a fair offer, I'll consider the reduced amount. I'll propose a 50-50 split of the reduced amount.
