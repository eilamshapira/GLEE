"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm suggesting a slightly higher share for me since I face 10% inflation each round. If we delay, the total value decreases for me, so this is a fair split that benefits us both without needing multiple rounds. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice claims she faces inflation too, but I don't know that for certain. What I do know is that:
1. I face 10% inflation per round
2. $45 now is better than a potentially larger amount later due to inflation
3. If we go through many rounds, we both risk getting nothing
4. 45/55 split is fairly reasonable

While I could counter-offer for a 50/50 split, the inflation penalty means I'd actually get less than $45 in the next round even if Alice accepts. A 45% share now is better than risking further deterioration of value.
