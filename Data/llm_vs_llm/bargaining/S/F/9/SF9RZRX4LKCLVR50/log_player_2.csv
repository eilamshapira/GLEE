"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice has offered a 50-50 split, which appears fair at first glance
2. However, if I reject, I could propose a better deal for myself in round 2
3. But I need to consider that the money loses 10% value for me each round
4. If I reject now, in round 2 the $10,000 will only be worth $9,000 to me
5. A 50-50 split gives me $5,000 right now, which is better than risking getting less in future rounds due to inflation

Given these factors, I'll accept. This is a fair offer and the inflation risk makes it unwise to reject.
