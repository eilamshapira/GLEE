"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Since the money loses 10% value for me each round, I need a slightly higher portion now. This is a fair offer considering the inflation penalty I face. If we wait too long, we'll both lose substantially due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but I propose a slightly more even split. I need a little extra to account for my future potential losses as well. Let's aim for a fair agreement now! 
# Alice gain: 490000 
# Bob gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
