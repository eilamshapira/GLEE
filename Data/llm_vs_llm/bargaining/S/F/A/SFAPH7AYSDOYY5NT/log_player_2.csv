"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Since the money loses 10% value for me each round, I need a slightly higher portion now. This is a fair offer considering the inflation penalty I face. If we wait too long, we'll both lose substantially due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
