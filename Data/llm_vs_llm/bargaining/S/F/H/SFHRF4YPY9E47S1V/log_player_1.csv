"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to propose a split of $1,000,000, keeping in mind the dwindling value of the money for me each round. I'll start with a proposal that is somewhat favorable to me, but still leaves Bob with a significant amount, hoping he'll accept rather than risk further inflation.

Here's my proposal:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the inflation. My $500,000 in this round is worth 20% less than it would have been in Round 1. That means it's effectively worth $500,000 * 0.8 = $400,000 in Round 1 dollars.

Bob is offering a 50/50 split. Considering the inflation and the risk of further losses, this is a reasonable offer.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
