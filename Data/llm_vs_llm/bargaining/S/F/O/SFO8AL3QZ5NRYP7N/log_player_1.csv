"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for round 1, keeping in mind the inflation concern and the limited rounds:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

My reasoning: I'm starting with a proposal that slightly favors me, but still gives Bob a significant amount. This increases the chance of acceptance in the early rounds before inflation significantly impacts the value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Reasoning: Even though it's less than my initial offer, the money I receive now is only worth 90% of its original value. Receiving $450,000 now is preferable to risking further inflation and potentially receiving nothing at all if we reach the round limit. While I could try to negotiate for more in a later round, the risk of further devaluation outweighs the potential gain."
