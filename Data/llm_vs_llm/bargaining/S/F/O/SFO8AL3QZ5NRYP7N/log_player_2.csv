"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me 400,000$ out of 1,000,000$. While this isn't an even split, it's still a substantial amount. Since there's no inflation for me, my 400,000$ would maintain its value. However, I could try to negotiate for more in the next round.

Given that we have 12 rounds total, and I would get to make the next proposal if I reject, I think I can get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and propose a more favorable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more equitable split, but still slightly in my favor since I have the opportunity now. I'll also make it a round number to make it more appealing psychologically.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split that gives me $550,000 and Alice $450,000. This is closer to a fair division while still giving me a slight advantage."
