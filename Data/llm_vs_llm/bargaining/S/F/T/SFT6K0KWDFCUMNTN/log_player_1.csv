"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you can counter if you disagree.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split, which gives us both equal shares. Since I face a 5% inflation penalty each round, quick agreement benefits me, but I still think an even split is most fair for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Due to 5% inflation, a $50 gain for me in round 2 is actually worth $47.50
2. If I reject and make a new offer in round 3, any amount I get will be worth 10% less
3. Bob is offering an equal split, which is generally considered fair
4. Prolonging negotiations will keep reducing the real value of my share
5. There's no guarantee Bob will accept a better offer in future rounds
