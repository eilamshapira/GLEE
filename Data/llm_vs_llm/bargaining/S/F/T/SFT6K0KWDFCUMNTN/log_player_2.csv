"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you can counter if you disagree. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice has proposed a 60-40 split in her favor, giving me $40 and keeping $60 for herself.

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but the money will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation. So in the next round, the $100 would effectively be worth $95 to me.

While a 50-50 split might seem more fair, I need to weigh the cost of delay against the potential gain from negotiation. Since inflation affects me each round, it may be better to accept a reasonable offer early rather than holding out for more and losing value.

I'll reject this offer to make a counter-proposal, since I think we can reach a more balanced agreement.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more balanced while acknowledging the inflation pressure I'm facing.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split, which gives us both equal shares. Since I face a 5% inflation penalty each round, quick agreement benefits me, but I still think an even split is most fair for both of us.""}"
