"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. Due to the inflation effect, we both lose value with each passing round. A fair split now is better than continued negotiation where we both lose. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
