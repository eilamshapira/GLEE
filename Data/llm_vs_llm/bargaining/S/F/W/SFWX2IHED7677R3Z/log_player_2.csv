"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share for both 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $40 while she gets $60. While she calls it a ""fair share,"" it's actually favoring her by $20. Since this is just the first round and I have more opportunities to negotiate, I'll reject this uneven split and make a counter-proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose an equal split, which is truly fair for both parties.

{""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Let's split it equally - 50/50 is truly fair for both of us""}"
