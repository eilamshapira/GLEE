"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer gives me 40$ which is significant, but I need to consider inflation. If I reject now, the 100$ will be worth 95$ in the next round. I should only reject if I believe I can propose and secure more than 40$ in the next round, accounting for this 5% inflation.

Let me analyze: If I counter-propose in the next round, I could potentially secure more than 40$, even accounting for the 5% inflation. But there's a risk Alice rejects my counter-offer, leading to further inflation.

Given that this is a first offer and I have room to negotiate, I'll reject.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a slightly more favorable split for myself while still offering Alice a substantial portion to make the deal attractive.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I believe this is a fair and equitable split that gives us both equal shares. Since I rejected the previous offer and we're now facing inflation, this balanced approach should be appealing to both of us rather than continuing to subsequent rounds."
