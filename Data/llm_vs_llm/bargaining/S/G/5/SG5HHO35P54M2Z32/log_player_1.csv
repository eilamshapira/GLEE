"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the inflation.

*   **My initial money value:** $100
*   **My effective money value due to inflation:** $100 * (1 - 0.10)^1 = $90
*   **Bob's effective money value due to inflation:** $100 * (1 - 0.20)^1 = $80

Bob's offer:

*   Alice gain: 40
*   Bob gain: 60

I need to decide if $40 is worth more to me than the chance of getting a better deal in the future, considering the inflation.
Let's calculate the value I get after inflation: $40 * (1-0.10) = $36

Given the situation and the potential risk of getting nothing if we reach round 12, I will accept the offer.
