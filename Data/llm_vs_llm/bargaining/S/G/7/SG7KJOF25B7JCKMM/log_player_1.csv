"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make my first offer to Bob, considering the different inflation rates that affect us.

""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm suggesting a fair split that accounts for our different inflation rates. You face 10% inflation per round while I face 5%, so accepting now is in both our interests. This offer gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging we both want to maximize our outcomes.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation rates, I believe a slightly more balanced split is in order. This offer still accounts for your lower inflation rate but adjusts for my higher rate. Let's settle on this before the money loses more value. 
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
