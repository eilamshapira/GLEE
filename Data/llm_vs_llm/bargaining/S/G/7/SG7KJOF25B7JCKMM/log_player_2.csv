# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm suggesting a fair split that accounts for our different inflation rates. You face 10% inflation per round while I face 5%, so accepting now is in both our interests. This offer gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging we both want to maximize our outcomes. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000
