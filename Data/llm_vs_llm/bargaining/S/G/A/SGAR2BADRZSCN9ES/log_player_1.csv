"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I suggest a fair 50/50 split. Since inflation doesn't affect me, and we don't know how it affects you, this seems like the most equitable solution. We both walk away with the same amount.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I need a bit more to compensate for the inflation. Let's settle this quickly, so we both get something. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
