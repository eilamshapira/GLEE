"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

My reasoning is that offering Bob a reasonable amount upfront increases the chances of him accepting, avoiding the inflation penalty in later rounds. I'm prioritizing securing a good portion for myself while still making it appealing for him to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I see Bob's offer. Let's analyze this:

*   **Bob's offer:** I get $45, Bob gets $55.
*   **Inflation:** My money is worth 5% less than Round 1.

If I accept, I get $45. If I reject, I risk further inflation in the next round. Let's calculate the effective value of $45 after the 5% loss: $45 * 0.95 = $42.75 (relative to round 1).

I'm not happy with this, as it's a significant drop from my initial proposal. However, more rounds mean more inflation.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, it's my turn to propose again. Remember, I've now experienced two rounds of inflation, so the money is worth 10% less to me than at the start. I need to balance getting a fair share with the risk of further losses.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

My reasoning is as follows:

*   I've come down from my initial offer, acknowledging Bob's desire for a larger share.
*   However, I'm not willing to go as low as his offer, given the inflation.
*   This split still gives me slightly more than him, but hopefully enough to entice him to accept and avoid further losses for both of us."
