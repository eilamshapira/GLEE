"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, the $4000 offered to me is actually worth $4000 * 0.8 = $3200 to me.

Considering this, I think the offer is not in my favor.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less in each round, and this is the third round, the money I gain is now worth 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 of its original value.

To make up for this loss, I'll make an offer that gives me a bit more.
