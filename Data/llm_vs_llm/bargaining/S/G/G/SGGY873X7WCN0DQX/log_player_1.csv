"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your point, but considering the inflation I'm facing, I think this split is fairer. Let's settle here to avoid further devaluation for me. 
# Alice gain: 5300 
# Bob gain: 4700 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
