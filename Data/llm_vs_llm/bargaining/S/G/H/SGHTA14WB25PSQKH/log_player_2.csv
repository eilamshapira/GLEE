"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. It's a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
2. However, if I reject now, in the next round I can make a proposal
3. The money will be worth 20% less for me if I reject, so the 500,000 would become worth 400,000 in the next round
4. I don't know how inflation affects Alice
5. There's a risk of getting nothing if we drag this out too long

Given that:
- This is a fair split
- Inflation will definitely hurt my position
- There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal later
- Risk of getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds
