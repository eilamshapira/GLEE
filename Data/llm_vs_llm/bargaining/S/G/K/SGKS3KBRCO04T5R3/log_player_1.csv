"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an initial proposal for dividing the $10,000. Given that money loses 20% of its value for me with each passing round, I have an incentive to reach an agreement early.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose an even split of the money. This is fair to both of us and allows us to finish the game immediately without any inflation reducing the value."
