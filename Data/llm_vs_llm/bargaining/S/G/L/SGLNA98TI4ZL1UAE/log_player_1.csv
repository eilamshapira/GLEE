"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, I need to evaluate the offer carefully.

*   **My Situation:** My money is worth 5% less.
*   **Bob's Situation:** Bob's money is worth 20% less.

My original offer was 60$ for me.
Now I'm offered 70$.

Since the offer is a bit better than before (and because of the time pressure), I will accept it.

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
