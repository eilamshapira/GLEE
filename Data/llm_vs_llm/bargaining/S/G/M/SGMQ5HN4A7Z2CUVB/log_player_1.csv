"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to propose a division of the $10,000, keeping in mind the decreasing value for Bob and the limited number of rounds. To start, I'll offer a split that is favorable to me but hopefully still acceptable to Bob, considering the alternative is further devaluation.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I see Bob's offer. I need to decide if it's better to accept now or risk further devaluation. The key is to calculate what Bob's gain is actually worth to him now.

$5500 * (1 - 0.20) = $4400

So Bob's offer is equivalent to me getting $4500 and him getting $4400 in the initial round.

If I reject, I might get a better offer next round, but Bob's value will decrease further. If Bob's value decreases further, he is less likely to accept an offer.

I'm going to accept.
