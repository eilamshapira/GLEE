"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer in this round, considering the inflation effect if we were to proceed further.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This division gives Bob a substantial portion while acknowledging that the money is worth less to me in future rounds due to inflation. If we need to move to a second round, I'd lose 20% of the value, so I'm incentivized to reach an agreement now with a reasonable offer."
