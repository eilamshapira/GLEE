"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer strategically given the 10% inflation per round that affects me.

If I accept now, I get $500,000.

If I reject and propose in round 2, the total pot is worth 10% less to me, so I'd be dividing an effective $900,000 from my perspective. Even if I proposed to take all of it (which Alice would likely reject), my maximum potential gain would be $900,000.

A fair split now gives me $500,000, which is quite reasonable considering inflation will reduce my potential gains in future rounds. Also, if we keep rejecting offers for too many rounds, we risk getting nothing.
