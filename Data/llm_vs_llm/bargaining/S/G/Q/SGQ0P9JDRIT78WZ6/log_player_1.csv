"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this.

*   **My Perspective:** The money is worth 20% less. This means my $1 in round 2 is only worth $0.80 compared to round 1.
*   **Bob's Offer:** Alice gets $50, and Bob gets $50.

If I accept, I get $50, but it's value is $50 \* 0.80 = $40.

Since I'm playing to maximize my gain, I will:

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 3. Remember, with each round, my money is worth less.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's break this down.

*   **My Perspective (Alice):** The money is worth 48.8% less than in round 1. So, $1 in round 4 is worth $0.512 compared to round 1 ($1 * (1-0.488) = $0.512).
*   **Bob's Offer:** Alice gets $40, Bob gets $60.

My $40 in this round is worth $40 \* 0.512 = $20.48 compared to round 1.

Given the inflation, this offer is very low.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 5.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Alright, let's calculate.

*   **My Perspective (Alice):** My money is worth 67.23% less than in Round 1. This means $1 in Round 6 is worth $0.3277 in terms of Round 1 value ($1 * (1-0.6723) = $0.3277).
*   **Bob's Offer:** Alice gets $30, Bob gets $70.

My $30 in this round is worth $30 \* 0.3277 = $9.831 compared to round 1.

I'm getting less than $10 in terms of the original value. Given how much the value of money is decreasing for me, it's time to accept something.

```json

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.

Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 7.
