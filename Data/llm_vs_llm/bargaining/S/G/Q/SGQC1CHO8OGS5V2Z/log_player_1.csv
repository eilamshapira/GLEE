Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your earlier proposal. Since it's my turn now, I’d like to offer a near-fair split that concludes our negotiations swiftly. I’m proposing $5500 for me and $4500 for you. I believe this is a reasonable compromise after our back-and-forth, and I hope you agree to settle now. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
