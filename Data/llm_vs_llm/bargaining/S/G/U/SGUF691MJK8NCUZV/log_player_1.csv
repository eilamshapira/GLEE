Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation affecting my share, I propose a 55/45 split in my favor this round. Let's find a balance that works for both of us before the value decreases further for me. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
