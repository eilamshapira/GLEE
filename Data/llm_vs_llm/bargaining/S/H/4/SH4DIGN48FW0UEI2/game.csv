60.0,40.0,I suggest a fair split where I get a bit more since I'm making the first offer and taking initiative. This way we both walk away with a good amount.,Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Alice, I've rejected your first offer as it wasn't balanced enough. I'm proposing a split that favors me slightly since you started with a split heavily in your favor. This is still fair as you get 45% of the total. If you reject, we'll both face further inflation effects, which isn't in either of our best interests.",Bob,2,
