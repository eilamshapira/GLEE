"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,

""message"": ""I suggest a fair split where I get a bit more since I'm making the first offer and taking initiative. This way we both walk away with a good amount.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've rejected your first offer as it wasn't balanced enough. I'm proposing a split that favors me slightly since you started with a split heavily in your favor. This is still fair as you get 45% of the total. If you reject, we'll both face further inflation effects, which isn't in either of our best interests. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept now, I get $45, but it's worth 5% less due to inflation, so effectively $42.75
2. If I reject, I can make another offer, but:
   - The money will be worth even less (10% less than original)
   - Bob might reject again, leading to further devaluation
   - There's risk in prolonging the negotiation

Bob's reasoning about inflation is valid. While the split isn't ideal from my perspective, the inflation penalty makes accepting this offer more attractive than risking further rounds.
