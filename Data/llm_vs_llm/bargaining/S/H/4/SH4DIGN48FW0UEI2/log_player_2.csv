"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a fair split where I get a bit more since I'm making the first offer and taking initiative. This way we both walk away with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer gives me $40 while she takes $60. Given that we're dividing $100, this isn't an equal split, but I need to consider the 10% inflation penalty if I reject and move to the next round.

If I reject, the total value in the next round would effectively be worth 10% less to me, meaning the $100 would be worth only $90 to me. If I could get more than $40 out of that $90 in the next round, it might be worth rejecting.

Since I would be making the offer in the next round, I could potentially propose a split that gives me more than $40 (accounting for inflation). However, Alice might then reject my offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation for me.

Given these considerations, I'll reject this offer to try for a better deal in the next round.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I need to make a strategic offer considering the inflation effect. Since the $100 is now worth only $90 to me due to 10% inflation, I should aim to get more than $40 (which was Alice's previous offer) to make my rejection worthwhile.

{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Alice, I've rejected your first offer as it wasn't balanced enough. I'm proposing a split that favors me slightly since you started with a split heavily in your favor. This is still fair as you get 45% of the total. If you reject, we'll both face further inflation effects, which isn't in either of our best interests.""}"
