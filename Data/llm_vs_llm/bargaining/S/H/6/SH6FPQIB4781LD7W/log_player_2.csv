"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split of 50/50. We both walk away happy with half a million each. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

1. Alice is offering a 50-50 split, which might seem fair at first glance.
2. If I reject, I'll face 5% inflation in the next round, meaning the money will be worth less to me.
3. However, I could potentially negotiate for a better deal in the next round.
4. 500,000$ is still a significant amount, and there's risk in rejection.
5. The inflation penalty and limited rounds make accepting early more attractive.

Given these factors, especially the inflation risk and the decent initial offer, I'll accept.
