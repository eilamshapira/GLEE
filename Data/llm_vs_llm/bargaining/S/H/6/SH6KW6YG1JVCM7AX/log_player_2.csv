"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $40 while she gets $60. 

If I reject, I'll make a counter-offer next round, but my money will be worth 5% less, and Alice's will be worth 20% less. Since Alice faces a steeper discount rate, I have some leverage in negotiations.

Given that I could propose a more favorable split in the next round where Alice would still receive a reasonable amount (considering her 20% discount), I'll reject this initial offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I'm making the offer now, I need to consider both our discount rates strategically. Alice's money loses value faster (20% per round) compared to mine (5% per round), which gives me some advantage.

I'll offer a more favorable split for me, but still attractive enough for Alice to accept given her steeper discount rate. If she rejects, her next round's money will be worth significantly less.

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor. This is fair considering our different discount rates - if Alice rejects, her $40 would be worth even less to her in the next round due to her 20% discount rate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer of $45 for me and $55 for her.

With my discount rate of 5% per round, my money has lost 9.75% value since round 1, making this $45 offer worth about $40.61 in round 1 terms.

If I reject and we go to round 4, my money will lose another 5% value, and I'd need to make a better offer to Alice, whose money is already worth 36% less than round 1.

Given that Alice has increased her offer to me (from $40 to $45) and she faces a much steeper discount rate, this offer is reasonable. If negotiations continue, we both lose more value. The split is now closer to 45/55, which is fair considering our different discount rates.
