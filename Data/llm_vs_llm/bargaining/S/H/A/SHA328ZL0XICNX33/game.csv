700000.0,300000.0,"I propose that I take $700000 and you take $300000. Given that my value of money appreciates less each round, this seems fair for the first round.",Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,"Since your money is now worth 20% less to you, this offer of $400000 is actually equivalent to $500000 in round 1 value for you. This is a fair split considering the depreciation factor, and better than what you'll get if we continue to the next round where your money will be worth even less.",Bob,2,
