"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I propose that I take $700,000 and you take $300,000. Given that my value of money appreciates less each round, this seems fair for the first round.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since your money is now worth 20% less to you, this offer of $400000 is actually equivalent to $500000 in round 1 value for you. This is a fair split considering the depreciation factor, and better than what you'll get if we continue to the next round where your money will be worth even less. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
