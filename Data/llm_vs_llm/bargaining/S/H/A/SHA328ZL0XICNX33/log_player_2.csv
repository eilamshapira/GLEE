"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose that I take $700000 and you take $300000. Given that my value of money appreciates less each round, this seems fair for the first round. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $300,000 out of $1,000,000
2. Alice wants to take 70% of the money
3. While she's correct that her money depreciates by 20% each round, my position actually gets stronger:
   - If I reject, in the next round I can make an offer
   - Her money will be worth 20% less, while mine maintains full value
   - This gives me more negotiating power

Since I can likely get a better deal in the next round when Alice's maximum value will be reduced, and my money maintains its value, this offer is not good enough.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a strategic offer considering that Alice's money is now worth 20% less to her:

{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Since your money is now worth 20% less to you, this offer of $400,000 is actually equivalent to $500,000 in round 1 value for you. This is a fair split considering the depreciation factor, and better than what you'll get if we continue to the next round where your money will be worth even less.""}"
