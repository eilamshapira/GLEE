"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair division that takes into account the different inflation rates we face. Since my money loses value faster (10% vs 5% per round), I should aim for a reasonable first offer that Bob would likely accept.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'll take 55% and offer Bob 45% of the million dollars. This is a fair offer considering that if Bob rejects it, the total value will decrease more significantly for me than for him in the next round. The split gives both of us a substantial amount while being close enough to 50-50 to be considered reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 310345 
# Bob gain: 689655 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Due to 10% inflation for me, $310,345 is now worth effectively $279,310 (90% of original value)
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round:
   - The money will be worth 80% of original value for me
   - The money will be worth 90% of original value for Bob
   - This significantly reduces my negotiating power

While Bob's offer gives him a much larger share, rejecting it would mean I'd be negotiating with an even weaker position in the next round due to the asymmetric inflation rates. The rapid 10% decay in value for my share makes accepting a smaller amount now better than risking an even smaller amount later.
