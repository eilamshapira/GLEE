6000.0,4000.0,Let's split it 60-40. I keep $6000 while you get $4000. This is a fair offer considering the inflation rate for both of us.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Let's split it 55-45. I get $5500 and you get $4500. This is fairer given the inflation, as my loss is greater than yours.",Bob,2,

5250.0,4750.0,"How about a 52.5-47.5 split? I get $5250 and you get $4750. This accounts for the inflation effects on both of us, giving you a bit more than previously.",Alice,3,
