Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. I keep $6,000 while you get $4,000. This is a fair offer considering the inflation rate for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 55-45. I get $5500 and you get $4500. This is fairer given the inflation, as my loss is greater than yours. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500
