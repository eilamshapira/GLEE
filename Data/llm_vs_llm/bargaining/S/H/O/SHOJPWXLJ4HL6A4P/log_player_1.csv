"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split where I get 55% and you get 45%. This way we both walk away with a substantial amount and avoid the risk of inflation eating into our gains.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your desire for a larger share, but I believe an even split would be the fairest outcome. Let's go with 50/50 to ensure a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The money is now worth less to me due to inflation, and Bob's offer gives me less than what I initially proposed. It would be more beneficial for me to make another proposal in the next round, even considering the additional 5% inflation penalty."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Bob, due to the 10% inflation penalty I'm now facing, I need to request a larger share to achieve a fair outcome.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm aware of the inflation affecting you. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share of 52.5% while you receive 47.5%. This acknowledges the inflation impact while still offering us both a substantial sum. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because:
1. The inflation penalty is becoming significant (14.26%)
2. Further negotiations would lead to more value loss for me
3. Bob has shown willingness to compromise from his previous 55-45 split
4. My actual value received (475000 * 0.8574 = 407,265) is still substantial
5. There's risk of getting nothing if we continue too long"
