# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, due to the 10% inflation penalty I'm now facing, I need to request a larger share to achieve a fair outcome. A 60-40 split would help compensate for my loss in value. Let's agree now before inflation reduces our gains further. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000
