"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
- Alice proposes a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
- However, I need to consider inflation
- If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
- But the money will be worth 20% less to me then
- Current offer: $5000
- Same amount next round would be worth: $4000 to me
- Even if I ask for more next round, I need to factor in that Alice might reject

Given that a 50-50 split is fair and trying to negotiate for more would result in significant value loss due to inflation, I should accept this offer.
