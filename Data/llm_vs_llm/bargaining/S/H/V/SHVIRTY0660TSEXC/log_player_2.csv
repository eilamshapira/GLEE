"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in round 2, but the money will be worth 10% less to me then. The current offer gives me $40, while in the next round, even if I propose a better split, any amount I get will be worth 10% less.

Given that:
1. The current offer is a 40/60 split, which isn't terrible
2. Alice has no inflation penalty, so she might be more patient
3. Rejecting means any future gains are worth less to me
4. There's a risk of getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds
