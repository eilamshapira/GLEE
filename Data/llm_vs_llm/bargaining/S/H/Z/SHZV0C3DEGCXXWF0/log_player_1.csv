"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60/40 seems reasonable""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, 55/45 is a better split 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same, but Bob's offer gives him more, and considering the inflation effect on Bob's gain, I think I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect on Bob's gain, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself. Since Bob's gain is worth 10% less, and it will be worth even less in the next round, I'll try to take advantage of that.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500,
  ""message"": ""Inflation is eating into your share, let's settle before it's too late""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation may be affecting me, but I still want a fair share 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect on Bob's gain increasing to 27.1%, his offer is becoming less valuable to him. However, considering the absolute amount, 4200 is still a significant amount, and I might be able to get a better deal if I wait.

But, looking at the numbers, I think 4200 is a reasonable offer, and I don't want to risk waiting too long and potentially getting a worse deal.
