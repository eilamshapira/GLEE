"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","I must decide based on the *current* value of the money, considering inflation. Let's analyze:

*   **My perspective (Alice):** I would receive $80. Due to 5% inflation, the value of $80 is slightly less than $80.
*   **Bob's perspective:** Bob would receive $20. Due to 20% inflation, the value of $20 is slightly less than $20.

Considering the round and the remaining opportunities, I will **reject** the offer because I am receiving a large portion of the money.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 3. Remember, inflation has reduced the value of the money for both of us.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze this offer, taking the accumulated inflation into account:

*   **My Perspective (Alice):** I'm offered $60, but the value is 14.26% less than in round 1.
*   **Bob's Perspective:** Bob is offered $40, but the value is 48.8% less than in round 1.

Because this is round 4, I have 9 rounds left to make an offer. I still have more opportunities to negotiate a better split. While the difference is significant and worth noting, it does not change my decision.

Therefore:

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here is my offer for Round 5:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's evaluate this offer:

*   **My Perspective (Alice):** I receive $50. The value of this $50 is 22.62% less than it was in Round 1.
*   **Bob's Perspective (Bob):** Bob receives $50. The value of this $50 is 67.23% less than it was in Round 1.

It is round 6 and I have 7 more rounds to get money. In this round, Bob is offering me 50/50 split. Considering the reduced worth of the money and remaining rounds, I must accept.

```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
