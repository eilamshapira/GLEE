"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a fair 60-40 split, considering the time value of money and potential future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me 4000$ in this round
2. If I reject, the next round's money will be worth 10% less to me
3. In the next round, I could propose a split, but Alice could reject it, leading to further rounds and more value loss for me
4. 4000$ now is better than potentially getting 5000$ in the next round (which would only be worth 4500$ to me due to the 10% decrease)
5. Alice's argument about time value of money is valid, as she's not affected by inflation

While 40% might seem low at first glance, considering the inflation penalty that only affects me, this is actually a reasonable offer. If I reject, I risk getting even less in future rounds due to the decreasing value.
