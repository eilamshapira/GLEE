"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Fair share, let's end early""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money equally and both benefit equally from the deal! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, the actual values would be:
Alice gain: 5000 * 0.95 = 4750
Bob gain: 5000 * 0.95 = 4750

Considering this, I think an equal split is reasonable.
