"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money evenly. Fair and square! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Alice has offered an even split of the $1,000,000, where we would each receive $500,000. This is a perfectly fair and equitable division.
