60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This seems fair considering we both want to maximize our gains, and we should try to reach an agreement quickly due to the 5% inflation affecting my earnings each round.",Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but a 60-40 split seems unfair to me. Considering we both want to maximize our gains, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This way, we both get a significant share, and we can reach an agreement quickly.",Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"Bob, let's meet in the middle. I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. Remember that each round causes my potential earnings to decrease by 5% due to inflation, while yours remain the same. This fair compromise acknowledges both our positions and helps us reach an agreement before inflation erodes the value further.",Alice,3,

48.0,52.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I still think your proposed split is slightly unfair. Considering the inflation only affects your earnings, I'm willing to make a small concession. I propose a 52-48 split in my favor, which is closer to the middle ground you suggested.",Bob,4,

52.0,48.0,"Bob, I see we're getting closer. I'm now proposing a 52-48 split in my favor. With inflation affecting only my earnings (now 19% less valuable than in round 1), this is a reasonable compromise. Let's not waste more rounds and reach an agreement now - further delays will only decrease the real value of what I receive.",Alice,5,

49.0,51.0,"Hi Alice, I see we're indeed getting closer. Considering the significant impact of inflation on your earnings, I'm willing to make another small concession. I propose a 51-49 split in my favor, which is almost an equal split. I believe this is a fair compromise, and we should be able to reach an agreement now.",Bob,6,
