"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This seems fair considering we both want to maximize our gains, and we should try to reach an agreement quickly due to the 5% inflation affecting my earnings each round. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

""alice_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but a 60-40 split seems unfair to me. Considering we both want to maximize our gains, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This way, we both get a significant share, and we can reach an agreement quickly.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's meet in the middle. I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. Remember that each round causes my potential earnings to decrease by 5% due to inflation, while yours remain the same. This fair compromise acknowledges both our positions and helps us reach an agreement before inflation erodes the value further. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55

Round 4

""alice_gain"": 48, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I still think your proposed split is slightly unfair. Considering the inflation only affects your earnings, I'm willing to make a small concession. I propose a 52-48 split in my favor, which is closer to the middle ground you suggested.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer. I'm now proposing a 52-48 split in my favor. With inflation affecting only my earnings (now 19% less valuable than in round 1), this is a reasonable compromise. Let's not waste more rounds and reach an agreement now - further delays will only decrease the real value of what I receive. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52
