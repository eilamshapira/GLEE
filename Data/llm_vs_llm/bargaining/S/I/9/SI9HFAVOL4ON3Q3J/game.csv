3571.0,6429.0,"Hi Bob, I'd like to settle the deal now. I propose I receive $3571 and you get $6429. This offer reflects our future bargaining positions – if you were to decline, your next chance as proposer in the second round would only yield you the equivalent of about 64% of the full value (after accounting for a 10% discount), while I would lose even more value with a 20% discount. Accepting now preserves the full worth of our money for both of us. What do you think?",Alice,1,

2700.0,7300.0,"Hi Alice, considering the discounts we both face, I believe this offer is more than fair. If you decline, your next offer in round 3 would be worth even less due to the 20% discount you face each round. I'm willing to take a larger share to compensate for the potential loss in future rounds, but still leave you with a considerable amount.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, I appreciate the offer. However, if we move to round 3, I will have the opportunity to propose a division that, even after the further discount, leaves me with a more favorable effective value. Therefore, I must reject this proposal.",Alice,2,reject
5625.0,4375.0,"Hi Bob, here's my proposal for round 3. I suggest that I receive $5625 and you receive $4375 in nominal terms. With the discount factors at this stage, my nominal share is worth 60% of its face value (about $3375 effective), while yours is worth 80% (roughly $3500 effective). If you reject this offer, you would get to propose in round 4—but by then, due to further discounting, you’d be in a position where securing a better effective payoff will be even tougher. I believe this split fairly reflects the diminishing value we both incur with delay. I look forward to your acceptance.",Alice,3,

1800.0,8200.0,"Hi Alice, given the significant discounts we've both faced so far, I'm making an offer that prioritizes my own gains. However, I still want to leave you with something. Considering your 20% discount per round, I believe it's in your best interest to accept this offer rather than risking an even lower value in the next round. This might be the best opportunity for you to secure a reasonable amount.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to keep something on the table. However, accepting $1800 now (which is effectively around $920 for me given the 48.8% discount) doesn't compare well with the potential outcome if I were to propose in round 5. In the next round, I'll have the opportunity to structure the division more advantageously before further discounting kicks in. For these reasons, I must reject your offer.",Alice,4,reject
1000.0,9000.0,"Hi Bob, here's my proposal for round 5. Given the ongoing discounting, your effective payoff this round is 0.6561 times your nominal share. If you reject and become proposer in round 6, you'll face a further discount (0.59049 effective per dollar), and you could secure nearly the whole pie—roughly $5904.9 effective, which translates to about $9000 in nominal terms at this round. Therefore, I'm offering you $9000 nominal (which is equivalent to your continuation value) and keeping $1000 for myself. I believe this is exactly your reservation value and the best I can do under the circumstances. I look forward to your acceptance.",Alice,5,
