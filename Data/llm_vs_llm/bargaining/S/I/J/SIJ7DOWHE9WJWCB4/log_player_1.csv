"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a reasonable first offer to divide the $100.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest we split this almost evenly, with me (Alice) taking $55 and you (Bob) getting $45. This is a fair offer that gives both of us a substantial portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
