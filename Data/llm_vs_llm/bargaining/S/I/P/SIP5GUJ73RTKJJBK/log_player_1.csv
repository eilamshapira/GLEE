"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a reasonable but slightly advantageous offer for myself, considering that Bob has the power to accept or reject.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split because it's close to fair while giving me a modest advantage. It shows respect for Bob's position while still pursuing my interests. Since there's no inflation effect on my side, I can afford to be relatively patient if Bob rejects this initial offer."
