45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, since inflation affects me at 10% per round but doesn't affect you, a more fair split would favor me slightly to account for this disadvantage. I'm proposing 55/45 which balances our interests - you still get a substantial amount, and I get protection against the inflation penalty.",Bob,2,
