"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since inflation affects me at 10% per round but doesn't affect you, a more fair split would favor me slightly to account for this disadvantage. I'm proposing 55/45 which balances our interests - you still get a substantial amount, and I get protection against the inflation penalty. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
