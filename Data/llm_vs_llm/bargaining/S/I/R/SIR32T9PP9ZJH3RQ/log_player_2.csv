"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly considering the inflation affects you more. This offer gives you a good start. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $40, while she takes $60. Given that inflation affects me (Bob) but not Alice, there's an advantage to accepting earlier. However, this split doesn't seem quite fair considering we're just starting.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, I could propose a more favorable split. But I need to be mindful that my money will be worth 10% less with each round.

I'll reject this initial offer to negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that acknowledges the inflation pressure on me while still aiming for a more equitable split.

{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, since inflation affects me at 10% per round but doesn't affect you, a more fair split would favor me slightly to account for this disadvantage. I'm proposing 55/45 which balances our interests - you still get a substantial amount, and I get protection against the inflation penalty.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concern about inflation. Let's meet in the middle. This offer gives you a bit more than the previous round, considering the inflation effect. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice has improved her offer from $40 to $45 for me, while taking $55 for herself. The inflation has already reduced the value of my potential earnings by 19% compared to round 1.

If I reject and move to round 4, inflation will increase to 27.1%, further reducing the value of whatever I might get. Alice has moved somewhat toward my position, offering me more than initially.

Given the mounting inflation pressure and the reasonable improvement in her offer, I'll accept this deal.
