"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money evenly for a fair start. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if splitting the money 50/50 is the best option given the 10% inflation per round affecting my share.

If I accept this offer now, I get $500,000.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2, my maximum possible gain would be affected by 10% inflation, meaning the $1,000,000 would be worth $900,000 to me. Even if I asked for all of it (which Alice would likely reject), my position isn't improving.

Since this is a fair first offer and my bargaining position only weakens with time due to inflation, accepting makes the most sense.
