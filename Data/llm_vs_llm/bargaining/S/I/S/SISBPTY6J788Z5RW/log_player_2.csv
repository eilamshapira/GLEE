"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm analyzing Alice's offer in this negotiation game.

Alice is proposing a 60-40 split where she gets $6,000 and I would get $4,000. While this does give me a substantial amount, it's not an equal 50-50 split of the $10,000.

Since this is just the first round and I would have the opportunity to make a counter-proposal if I reject, I believe it would be reasonable to negotiate for a more equal distribution.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split while acknowledging Alice's initial offer.

""alice_gain"": 5000,
