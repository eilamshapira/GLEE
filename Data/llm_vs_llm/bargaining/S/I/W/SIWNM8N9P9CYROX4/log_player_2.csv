"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each round, I'll try to make a fair offer. Considering the initial amount is $10,000, after one round, it's worth $9,000 for me (10% less).

My offer:
{""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""alice_gain"": 5500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Alice is trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less to her as well.

Considering the inflation, if I accept the offer, the $4500 I gain is worth 19% less, so it's approximately $3645 (4500 * 0.81).

I'll think about it...
