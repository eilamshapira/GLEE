"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll play as Alice in this negotiation game. I need to consider that with each round, the money loses 5% of its value for me. Let's start with a fair but slightly advantageous offer.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I think this is a reasonable first offer that gives both of us a substantial amount. Given the inflation penalty I face, I'm offering myself a bit more than half to account for potential future value loss if negotiations extend to multiple rounds."
