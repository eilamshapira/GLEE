550000.0,450000.0,"I'm offering you a favorable split of $450000, considering that waiting will cost you more due to your higher inflation rate of 20%. This is a fair offer that benefits us both by concluding quickly.",Alice,1,

500000.0,500000.0,"Given the higher inflation rate affecting my share, I propose an equal split of $500000 each. This is fair considering the rapid decrease in value for me, and it's a quick resolution for both of us.",Bob,2,

600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, let's end this now. Due to two rounds of inflation, your share has already lost 40% of its value, while mine has lost 20%. If we continue, your next round will see another 20% loss. This $400000 offer is worth more to you now than a larger amount would be in the next round. It's in both our interests to conclude this deal immediately.",Alice,3,

550000.0,450000.0,"Alice, considering the rapid devaluation of the money for me, I'm proposing $450000 for myself and $550000 for you. This offer still gives you a majority while allowing me to mitigate the impact of the next round's inflation, which would reduce my share's value significantly. Let's settle this now to avoid further loss.",Bob,4,
