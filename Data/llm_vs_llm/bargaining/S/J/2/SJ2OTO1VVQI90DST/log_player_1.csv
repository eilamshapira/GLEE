"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll propose a fair split that accounts for the different inflation impacts we face. Since Bob's money loses value faster (20% vs 10% per round), it's in his interest to accept a reasonable offer early.

{""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I'm offering you a favorable split of $450,000, considering that waiting will cost you more due to your higher inflation rate of 20%. This is a fair offer that benefits us both by concluding quickly.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the higher inflation rate affecting my share, I propose an equal split of $500000 each. This is fair considering the rapid decrease in value for me, and it's a quick resolution for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- In round 1, I offered 550k/450k split
- Now in round 2, Bob offers 500k/500k
- Due to 10% inflation, $500k is now worth $450k to me
- If I reject and we go to round 3, any money will be worth even less (another 10% drop for me, 20% for Bob)
- The equal split might seem fair, but considering inflation has already reduced the value, I'm getting less real value

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Given the inflation that has occurred, I need to adjust my offer to account for the decreased value of money for both of us. For Bob, the money has lost 40% of its value (20% per round), while for me it's lost 20% (10% per round).

{""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's end this now. Due to two rounds of inflation, your share has already lost 40% of its value, while mine has lost 20%. If we continue, your next round will see another 20% loss. This $400,000 offer is worth more to you now than a larger amount would be in the next round. It's in both our interests to conclude this deal immediately.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the rapid devaluation of the money for me, I'm proposing $450000 for myself and $550000 for you. This offer still gives you a majority while allowing me to mitigate the impact of the next round's inflation, which would reduce my share's value significantly. Let's settle this now to avoid further loss. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- Bob offers me $550k and takes $450k
- Due to 27.1% inflation, my $550k is now worth about $401k in round 1 value
- If I reject and make an offer in round 5, any money will be worth even less (another 10% drop for me, 20% for Bob)
- Bob's offer actually gives me a decent share considering the inflation impact
- Continuing further would erode both our values significantly
