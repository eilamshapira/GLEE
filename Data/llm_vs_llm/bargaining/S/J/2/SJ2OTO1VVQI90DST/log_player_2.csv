Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's end this now. Due to two rounds of inflation, your share has already lost 40% of its value, while mine has lost 20%. If we continue, your next round will see another 20% loss. This $400000 offer is worth more to you now than a larger amount would be in the next round. It's in both our interests to conclude this deal immediately. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000

This offer still gives you a majority while allowing me to mitigate the impact of the next round's inflation, which would reduce my share's value significantly. Let's settle this now to avoid further loss.""
