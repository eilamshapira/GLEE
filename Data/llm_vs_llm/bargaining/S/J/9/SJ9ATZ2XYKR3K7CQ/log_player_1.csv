"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less each round, I need to consider the real value. Let's calculate that:

*   **My (Alice's) perspective:** My initial gain was $900,000 in round 1. In round 2, the value of money for me is 5% less. This means my money in round 1 is equivalent to $900,000 * (1 - 0.05) = $855,000 in round 2 value.
*   **Bob's offer:** Bob is offering me $500,000.
*   **My comparison:** $500,000 is much less than $855,000 and since it's in my interest to maximize my gain over time, I should reject the offer from Bob to try to maximize my gain in the next rounds.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 3:

```json

  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the real value to me (Alice):

*   **My (Alice's) perspective:** My initial gain was $900,000 in round 1. In round 4, the value of money for me is 14.26% less, which means my money in round 1 is equivalent to $900,000 * (1 - 0.1426) = $771,660 in round 4 value.
*   **Bob's offer:** Bob is offering me $600,000 in this round.
*   **My comparison:** $600,000 is less than $771,660 and I need to consider the value of the money as well. Since it's in my interest to maximize my gain over time, I should reject the offer from Bob to try to maximize my gain in the next rounds.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 5:

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 650000 
# Bob gain: 350000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the real value to me (Alice):

*   **My (Alice's) perspective:** My initial gain was $900,000 in round 1. In round 6, the value of money for me is 22.62% less, which means my money in round 1 is equivalent to $900,000 * (1 - 0.2262) = $696,420 in round 6 value.
*   **Bob's offer:** Bob is offering me $650,000 in this round.
*   **My comparison:** While the offered $650,000 is less than the equivalent value of $696,420 I had earlier, the difference is decreasing. Since it's in my interest to maximize my gain over time, but with only a few rounds left, I should accept this offer before my gain decreases further.
