I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement.  Let's see if he's willing to accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is closer to an even split, it's still far from my ideal outcome.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal for myself in the remaining rounds.  Let's see what Bob proposes next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly, but I'm still hoping to secure a deal before inflation eats away at our potential gains. This offer is still very favorable for me and I believe it's reasonable enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting more attractive, but it's still not enough for me. I'm sticking to my strategy of demanding a larger share. I believe I can secure a better deal if we continue negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000} 
```

I'm continuing to lower my offer, but only slightly. This offer still gives me a significant majority of the money, and it's starting to get more appealing for Bob as inflation erodes his potential gains. I'm hoping to secure a deal this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 650000 
# Bob gain: 350000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is becoming increasingly attractive, and the effects of inflation are starting to weigh heavily on the value of the money Bob gains. While it's not my ideal outcome, I'm willing to accept this offer to secure a share of the money before further inflation diminishes our potential gains."
