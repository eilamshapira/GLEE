"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This is a very simple, but fair starting offer.  I'm keeping most of the money, but I'm giving Bob a significant portion. 

Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my initial offer.  While he is keeping a larger share, my potential gain has decreased even more due to the inflation. It's not worth accepting such a drastic reduction. 

Let's see if I can get a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

This is my new offer, keeping in mind the inflation. I'm reducing my initial offer, but still giving Bob a sizeable share, especially after the inflation on his side. I hope this is enough to convince him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This offer is significantly less appealing than my initial offer.  However, given the substantial inflation impacting both of us, and the risk of a further decline in my potential gains with each round,  it's best to accept.

Let's move on!"
