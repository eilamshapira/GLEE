"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly and avoid losses due to inflation!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I value the money a bit more! How about this split? 
# Alice gain: 4700 
# Bob gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll calculate the actual value of the offer.

Original amount: $10,000
Inflation for me: 5% (0.05)
Inflation for Bob: 10% (0.10)

Value for me: $10,000 * (1 - 0.05) = $9,500
Value for Bob: $10,000 * (1 - 0.10) = $9,000

Bob's offer:
Alice gain: $4,700
Bob gain: $5,300

Since the value for me is $9,500, Bob's offer gives me approximately 49.5% of the value ($4,700 / $9,500).

I think I can do better than that.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer.

Original amount: $10,000
Inflation for me (2 rounds): 5% * 2 = 10% (0.10)  -  $10,000 * (1 - 0.10) = $9,000 -  but for 2 rounds it is (1-0.05)^2 = 0.9025 
Inflation for Bob (2 rounds): 10% * 2 = 20% (0.20)  - $10,000 * (1 - 0.20) = $8,000 - but for 2 rounds it is (1-0.10)^2 = 0.81

Value for me: $10,000 * 0.9025 = $9,025
Value for Bob: $10,000 * 0.81 = $8,100

My offer:
Alice gain: $5,200
Bob gain: $4,800

{""alice_gain"": 5200, 
""bob_gain"": 4800, 
""message"": ""Let's find a mutually beneficial split before inflation eats away more value!""}"
