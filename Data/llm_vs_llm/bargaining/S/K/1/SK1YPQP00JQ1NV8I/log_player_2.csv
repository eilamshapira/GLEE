"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, the money is now worth 20% less to me, so the total amount I consider is 100 * 0.8 = $80. 

To make a fair offer, I'll consider the reduced amount. I'll offer Alice a bit less than half of the original $100, considering the reduced value.
