"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split this fairly! I'll take 60, you get 40. We both win! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100
2. If I reject, we move to next round where I can make an offer
3. However, due to 10% inflation, $100 will be worth $90 in the next round
4. 60-40 split is not quite fair, but the inflation penalty makes waiting costly

Since this is the first round and the offer isn't terrible (though not entirely fair), rejecting would mean I'd have to propose splitting a smaller total amount in the next round. The 10% inflation penalty makes waiting expensive.
