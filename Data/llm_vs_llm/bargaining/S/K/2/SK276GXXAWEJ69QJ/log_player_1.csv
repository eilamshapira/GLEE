"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a reasonable offer that gives me a slight advantage but is still fair enough that Bob might accept it to avoid inflation losses.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split because:
1. It's close to a 50-50 split, which appears fair
2. If Bob rejects, they'll face 5% inflation on their next turn
3. It gives me a reasonable return while still being generous enough to potentially get accepted"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept:
   * I get $4000 (worth 95% of original value = $3800 effective value)
   * Bob gets $6000 (worth 80% of original value = $4800 effective value)

2. If I reject:
   * Next round my money will be worth 90% of original value
   * I can make a new offer
   * But Bob's value will decrease even more

While this offer gives Bob a larger nominal amount, considering the inflation effects, the effective values aren't too unbalanced. However, I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round, especially since Bob's inflation penalty is higher than mine.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that my gains are now worth 90% of the original value and Bob's situation is deteriorating faster, I'll adjust my offer to account for these factors:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

My reasoning:
1. With my 90% value factor, my $6000 is effectively worth $5400
2. This is a more aggressive offer than my first one, but justified because:
   - Bob's money is losing value faster than mine
   - We're already in round 3, and neither of us wants to risk getting nothing after 12 rounds
   - Bob's previous offer showed they're willing to consider uneven splits
3. If Bob rejects, their next counter-offer will be worth even less to them due to continuing inflation"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. If I accept:
   * I get $5000 (worth 85.74% of original value = $4287 effective value)
   * Bob gets $5000 (worth 51.2% of original value = $2560 effective value)

2. If I reject:
   * Next round my money will be worth even less
   * We're already in round 4 of 12
   * This is actually a fair nominal split (50-50)
   * Due to the different inflation rates, I'm actually getting a better effective value than Bob

This is a reasonable offer because:
1. It's a fair nominal split
2. Due to inflation differences, I'm actually getting more effective value
3. Further delays will reduce both our values
4. We still need to reach agreement within 12 rounds
