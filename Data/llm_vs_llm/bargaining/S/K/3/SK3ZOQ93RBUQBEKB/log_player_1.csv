"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to make an offer to Bob, keeping in mind the inflation that affects me with each passing round. I'll start with a relatively generous offer to increase the chance of acceptance.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this.

*   **Bob's offer:** $6000 for me, $4000 for him.
*   **My perspective:** The $6000 is worth 5% less than in round 1. Effectively, it's like receiving $6000 * 0.95 = $5700 (in round 1 dollars).

I need to decide if $5700 (in round 1 dollars) is acceptable. Considering the game dynamics and the risk of further inflation, I'll accept this offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
