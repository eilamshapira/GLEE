"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering a 50-50 split of the $1,000,000, which seems fair at first glance. However, I need to account for the 5% inflation effect on my share if I reject and move to the next round.

If I reject, the total amount will effectively be worth $950,000 to me in the next round. Even if I were to get 100% of that amount (which is unlikely), I'd get less than the $500,000 being offered now. And if we continue negotiating, inflation will keep reducing the value further for me.

Given the inflation penalty I face and the fact that a 50-50 split is objectively fair, accepting this offer makes the most sense.
