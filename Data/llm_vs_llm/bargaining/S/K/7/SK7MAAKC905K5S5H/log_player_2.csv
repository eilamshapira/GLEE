"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer gives me $40 and herself $60. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but due to inflation, the money would be worth 5% less to me. So instead of $100 total, it would effectively be worth $95 from my perspective.

If I accept now, I get $40. If I reject and make a counter-offer, even if I asked for all $100 and somehow got it, it would only be worth $95 to me. Realistically, I'd probably need to offer Alice something reasonable to get her to accept.

Given the inflation penalty and the fact that $40 is a reasonably fair split (not too far from 50-50), I'll accept this offer.
