I'm rejecting this offer, even though it's slightly better for me than a 50/50 split.  Here's why:

* **Inflation:** While my buying power remains the same, Alice's is diminishing. This means each round that passes gives me a stronger negotiating position.
* **Time pressure:** We have a limited number of rounds. As we get closer to the deadline, the pressure on Alice to make a deal will increase.

I'm willing to gamble that I can secure a better deal in later rounds."

Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation!  While her offer is slightly better, I believe the continued devaluation of her share will push her towards a more agreeable split in the next few rounds."

It's time to take the win. The difference in our positions is narrowing, and the increasing inflation for Alice makes this offer close enough to my previous proposal to accept. It's better to secure a favorable deal now than risk getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
