"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1, taking into account the potential for inflation and the need to secure a reasonable amount early:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

My reasoning: I'm starting with a proposal that favors me slightly, but still gives Bob a significant portion. This aims to increase the chances of acceptance in the early rounds when the money is worth the most to both of us."
