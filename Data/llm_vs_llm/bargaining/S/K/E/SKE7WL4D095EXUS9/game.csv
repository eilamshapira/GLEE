6000.0,4000.0,I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor since inflation affects me by 5% per round. This gives us both a fair outcome considering the time pressure we're under. Let's agree and split the money now rather than losing value through negotiations.,Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"Given the inflation rate affecting my share, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This offer takes into account the value loss we're both facing and aims for a quick resolution before our shares diminish further. Let's settle this now.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,I see we both want a fair split considering inflation. I'm now proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. This is more balanced than our previous offers and recognizes that we're both losing value with each round. The money is already worth 10% less to me than in round 1. Let's agree now before we both lose more.,Alice,3,

4800.0,5200.0,"Considering the significant impact of inflation on my share, now at 19% less value, I propose a 52-48 split in my favor. This offer is a compromise, aiming to balance our needs while acknowledging the urgency to settle before our shares lose even more value. Let's end this now and secure what we can.",Bob,4,

5200.0,4800.0,"Let's meet in the middle. I'm proposing a 52-48 split in my favor, which is exactly the mirror of your last offer. We're both losing value quickly - my share is now worth nearly 15% less than in round 1. If we don't agree soon, we'll both end up with much less. This is a fair compromise that recognizes both our positions.",Alice,5,
