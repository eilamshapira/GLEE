Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see we both want a fair split considering inflation. I'm now proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. This is more balanced than our previous offers and recognizes that we're both losing value with each round. The money is already worth 10% less to me than in round 1. Let's agree now before we both lose more.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. I'm proposing a 52-48 split in my favor, which is exactly the mirror of your last offer. We're both losing value quickly - my share is now worth nearly 15% less than in round 1. If we don't agree soon, we'll both end up with much less. This is a fair compromise that recognizes both our positions.
