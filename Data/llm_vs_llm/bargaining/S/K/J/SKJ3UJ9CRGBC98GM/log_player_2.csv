"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: I get $4000, Alice gets $6000
2. If I reject, we go to next round where:
   * The money is worth 10% less for me
   * The money is worth 20% less for Alice
   * I get to make the next proposal

Since Alice will lose more value (20%) in the next round compared to my loss (10%), I have leverage to make a better offer in the next round. Even with my 10% loss, I could propose a split that would give me more than $4000 equivalent value.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me make a strategic offer:

Since money is now worth 10% less to me and 20% less to Alice, I should consider:
1. Any amount I get is worth 90% of its nominal value to me
2. Any amount Alice gets is worth 80% of its nominal value to her
3. Alice will compare the real value of my offer to what she could get in the next round (with further 20% depreciation)

I'll propose a more balanced split that's still advantageous to me:

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

This way:
- I get $5500 (worth $4950 to me after 10% depreciation)
- Alice gets $4500 (worth $3600 to her after 20% depreciation)

This is better for me than the previous offer, but still reasonable enough that Alice should accept rather than risk another round of depreciation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Current offer: 
   * I get $4200, but with 19% inflation, it's worth $3402 to me
   * Alice gets $5800, with 36% inflation, it's worth $3712 to her

2. If I reject:
   * Next round money will be worth 28% less for me (another 10%)
   * Next round money will be worth 49% less for Alice (another 20%)
   * I get to make the offer

Looking at the real values and considering that:
1. This offer gives me $3402 in real value
2. The rapid depreciation is hurting both of us significantly
3. Further negotiation will reduce the pie even more

Given the accelerating losses from inflation and that the real value difference isn't that large anymore, I should accept this offer rather than risk further depreciation.
