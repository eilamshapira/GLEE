"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it evenly, no need to gamble 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me consider Alice's offer.

Alice is proposing an even 50/50 split of the $1,000,000, giving each of us $500,000.

With the 10% inflation per round that affects me, if I reject this offer, the total value will be worth less to me in the next round. If I make a counter-offer in round 2, even if I asked for more, the total would be worth 10% less to me.

This is a fair first offer and considering the inflation penalty, accepting now guarantees me $500,000 rather than risking diminishing returns in later rounds.
