5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think an equal 50-50 split would be fairest. This gives us both $5000. Since inflation affects me by 5% each round, waiting costs us both money. This equal split respects both of our interests. I hope you'll accept so we can both walk away with a good outcome.",Bob,2,
