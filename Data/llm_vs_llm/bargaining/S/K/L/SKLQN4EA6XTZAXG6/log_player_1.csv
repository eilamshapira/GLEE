"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's split the money fairly. I propose 5500 for me and 4500 for you. This gives us both a significant amount and is a good starting point for negotiation. What do you think?""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think an equal 50-50 split would be fairest. This gives us both $5000. Since inflation affects me by 5% each round, waiting costs us both money. This equal split respects both of our interests. I hope you'll accept so we can both walk away with a good outcome. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
