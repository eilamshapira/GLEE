"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split the money fairly. I propose 5500 for me and 4500 for you. This gives us both a significant amount and is a good starting point for negotiation. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer would give me $4,500 while she takes $5,500. This isn't an equal split, and I have time to make a counter-offer. With inflation reducing the value by 5% each round, I should consider that waiting has a cost, but I think I can propose a fairer division in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a fair offer that accounts for inflation while still being attractive to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think an equal 50-50 split would be fairest. This gives us both $5,000. Since inflation affects me by 5% each round, waiting costs us both money. This equal split respects both of our interests. I hope you'll accept so we can both walk away with a good outcome.""}"
