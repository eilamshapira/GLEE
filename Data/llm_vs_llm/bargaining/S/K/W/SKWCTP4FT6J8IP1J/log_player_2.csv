Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While this offer is significantly worse than her first offer, it's still better for me to hold out for a better deal. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly. Every round that passes makes a significant difference.
* **Potential for a Better Offer:** Alice might be getting desperate and offer me a larger share in the next round. 

It's a gamble, but I believe the potential reward of waiting outweighs accepting this less favorable offer."
