"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn, a bit more balanced! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $450,000, but it's worth 20% less than the original value. So, the actual value I'll get is $450,000 * 0.8 = $360,000.

I think I can do better than that. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 20% * 2 = 40% less than the original value (20% less in Round 1 and another 20% less in Round 2, but it's cumulative, so 20% + 20% - (20% * 20%) = 36%, approximately, I will use 40% for simplicity, but the actual calculation will be 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64), and the money Bob gains is worth 5% * 2 = 10% less than the original value (5% less in Round 1 and another 5% less in Round 2, but it's cumulative, so 5% + 5% - (5% * 5%) = 9.75%, approximately, I will use 10% for simplicity, but the actual calculation will be 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025).

However, for this round, I will calculate the actual value after two rounds of inflation:
For me: 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64
For Bob: 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025

My offer will be:
{""alice_gain"": 520000, 
""bob_gain"": 480000, 
""message"": ""My turn again, more reasonable!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Getting closer to a fair deal, don't let it slip! 
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of Bob's offer considering the inflation:

For me: $420,000 * 0.512 (1 - 0.488) = $215,040
For Bob: $580,000 * 0.8574 (1 - 0.1426) = $497,252

I'm not satisfied with this offer, as it seems to favor Bob too much.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is worth 48.8% + 20% = 68.8% less than the original value is incorrect, I will calculate it as follows:
0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.512, so after 3 rounds of 20% decrease, the value is 51.2% of the original.
After 4 rounds of 20% decrease: 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.4096, so the value is 40.96% of the original.
For me: 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.4096
For Bob: 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.8145

My offer will be:
{""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Equal split, a fair chance for both!""}"
