600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we divide the $1000000 by awarding me $600000 and you $400000. Accepting now ensures you get the full value while I avoid the 5% depreciation in future rounds. Let's settle this efficiently for both our benefits.",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Alice, since you mentioned you face depreciation in future rounds while I don't, I'm proposing a more balanced split that still gives you a significant portion while accounting for our different positions. $450000 now is better than risking further depreciation in future rounds. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, I accept your offer. Considering that if we continue further the additional depreciation will significantly reduce the real value of my share, I believe your proposal of $450000 nominal — which is effectively worth 5% less than round 1 dollars — is the best available option for me. Let's settle on this.",Alice,2,accept
