"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we divide the $1,000,000 by awarding me $600,000 and you $400,000. Accepting now ensures you get the full value while I avoid the 5% depreciation in future rounds. Let's settle this efficiently for both our benefits.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since you mentioned you face depreciation in future rounds while I don't, I'm proposing a more balanced split that still gives you a significant portion while accounting for our different positions. $450000 now is better than risking further depreciation in future rounds. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I accept your offer. Considering that if we continue further the additional depreciation will significantly reduce the real value of my share, I believe your proposal of $450,000 nominal — which is effectively worth 5% less than round 1 dollars — is the best available option for me. Let's settle on this.""}"
