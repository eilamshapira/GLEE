"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we divide the $1000000 by awarding me $600000 and you $400000. Accepting now ensures you get the full value while I avoid the 5% depreciation in future rounds. Let's settle this efficiently for both our benefits. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $400,000 (40%) while keeping $600,000 (60%)
2. She mentions she faces 5% depreciation in future rounds, but I know I face 0% depreciation
3. Since I don't lose value in future rounds, I have a stronger negotiating position
4. I can make a counter-offer in the next round that would be more favorable to me
5. There's no downside for me in rejecting and negotiating further

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer since I have the advantage of no depreciation:

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, since you mentioned you face depreciation in future rounds while I don't, I'm proposing a more balanced split that still gives you a significant portion while accounting for our different positions. $450,000 now is better than risking further depreciation in future rounds. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances.""}"
