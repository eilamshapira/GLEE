"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with an equal split. Itâ€™s fair for both of us! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think through this offer carefully. 

Alice is proposing a 50-50 split ($5,000 each), which appears fair at face value. However, I need to consider the inflation factor - if I reject, the total value decreases by 10% for me in the next round.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2, the $10,000 would be worth only $9,000 to me. Even if I proposed taking all $9,000 (which Alice would likely reject), the maximum I could get would be less than accepting $5,000 now.

Since $5,000 now is better than potentially less in future rounds (due to inflation), and the initial offer is already a fair split, accepting is the rational choice.
