"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly. I think this is a good start for us both! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice's offer suggests a split, it's not an equal division of the $10,000. Alice is proposing to take $6,000 while offering me $4,000. Since this is the first round and I have the opportunity to make a counter-offer that could be more favorable, I'll reject this proposal.
