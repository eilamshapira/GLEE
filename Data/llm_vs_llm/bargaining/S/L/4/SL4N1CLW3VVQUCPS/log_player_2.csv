"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take a little more since I'm taking the first offer, but we can split it more evenly if you want. What do you think?

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Alice in each round, I'll take that into consideration.

In round 1, the total value of the money for me was $10,000, and for Alice, it was $10,000. 
Now, in round 2, the total value of the money for me is $10,000 * 0.95 = $9,500, and for Alice, it's $10,000 * 0.8 = $8,000.

Considering this, I'll make my offer.
