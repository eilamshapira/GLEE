"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split that gives us both a good amount, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first move.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable split that gives both of us a substantial amount while accounting for the first-mover advantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While it's slightly less favorable to me than my initial proposal, with the 10% inflation already affecting the value and the risk of further devaluation in future rounds, getting $45 now is better than continuing to negotiate. This is still a fair split, and accepting it ensures we both get a good amount before inflation erodes the value further."
