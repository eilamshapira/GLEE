450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I understand the devaluation is a concern, but your initial offer was a bit skewed in your favor. Let's be fair to both of us and split the difference. I propose we take $550000 each.  This ensures a more equitable outcome.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, I understand your point. Considering that any delay will mean further devaluation of my share (and likely yours as well), I decide to accept your offer. Let's settle this round with me receiving $450000 and you receiving $550000.",Alice,2,accept
