"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a split where I receive $550,000 and you receive $450,000. Since every round brings a 5% devaluation on my end, it's in both our best interests to settle now and secure our gains. Looking forward to your acceptance.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the devaluation is a concern, but your initial offer was a bit skewed in your favor. Let's be fair to both of us and split the difference. I propose we take $550000 each.  This ensures a more equitable outcome. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Bob, I understand your point. Considering that any delay will mean further devaluation of my share (and likely yours as well), I decide to accept your offer. Let's settle this round with me receiving $450,000 and you receiving $550,000.""}"
