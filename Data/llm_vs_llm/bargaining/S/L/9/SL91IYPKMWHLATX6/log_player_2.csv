Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a split where I receive $550000 and you receive $450000. Since every round brings a 5% devaluation on my end, it's in both our best interests to settle now and secure our gains. Looking forward to your acceptance. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000
