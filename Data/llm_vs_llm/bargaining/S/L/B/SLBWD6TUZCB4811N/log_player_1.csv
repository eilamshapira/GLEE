Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I will start with a proposal for round 1.

Here's my offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```"

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the situation. My money is worth less now. Bob's offer is: Alice gets $400,000 and Bob gets $600,000.

Considering the inflation and the limited rounds, I will make a decision.
