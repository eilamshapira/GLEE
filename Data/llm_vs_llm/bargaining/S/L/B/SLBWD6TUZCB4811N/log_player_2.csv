"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Alice is offering me $100,000 out of $1,000,000, which is only 10% of the total amount. That's quite low. If I reject:
- Next round I can make a counter-offer
- My money will be worth 20% less, but Alice's only 5% less
- My $100,000 would become worth $80,000 in real terms
- But I could propose a much better split for myself

Given this unfair initial offer and that we have plenty of rounds left, I should reject and make a counter-proposal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me make a more balanced offer. Since I want Alice to accept and avoid further devaluation:
- I'll propose a more equitable split, but still favorable to me
- Need to account for Alice's 5% devaluation per round
- Should be attractive enough to accept now rather than counter

{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000}

Explanation: I offer a 60-40 split in my favor. This is much more reasonable than Alice's initial 90-10 split, while still giving me a good portion. Alice should consider accepting this since waiting would mean their share devalues by 5% each round."
