700000.0,300000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing that I take $700000 and you take $300000. I'm starting with this offer because of the tasks and efforts involved. If you have a counter-offer, I'm open for discussion. Looking forward to a fair compromise!",Alice,1,

500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I believe a 50-50 split is fairer given the equal stakes we both have in this game. Considering the effects of inflation, this seems like a balanced approach. Let's aim for a quick resolution!",Bob,2,

600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I'm proposing that I take $600000 and you take $400000. Inflation has reduced the value for me, and I'm sure it affects you too in some way. Let's settle this soon to avoid further decrease in value!",Alice,3,

550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns about inflation, but I believe a split closer to the middle is still fair. I'm proposing $450000 for me and $550000 for you. Let's find a middle ground soon to minimize the impact of inflation on both of us!",Bob,4,
