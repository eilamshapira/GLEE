"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 310345 
# Alice gain: 689655 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $310,345 for me, $689,655 for Alice
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to inflation:
   - Next round my money will be worth 10% less
   - Alice's money will be worth 5% less
4. If I reject, I need to make an offer that Alice would accept, considering her 5% inflation rate
5. This is actually a decent first offer considering the inflation penalties

Since Alice has a lower inflation penalty (5% vs my 10%), she has slightly more negotiating power. If I reject, any counter-offer I make would need to be generous enough to overcome her 5% inflation loss, otherwise she'll reject it. Given these dynamics, this offer is actually reasonable.
