"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the $100 evenly so we both get a fair share. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $50 for me
2. If I reject and propose next round:
   * The money will be worth 20% less to me (my $50 would become worth $40)
   * The money will be worth 5% less to Alice (her $50 would become worth $47.50)
   * This significant inflation difference puts me at a disadvantage if I wait

Given the steep inflation penalty for me (20%) compared to Alice's smaller penalty (5%), it's better to accept a fair split now rather than try to negotiate for more in subsequent rounds where my purchasing power will decrease significantly.
