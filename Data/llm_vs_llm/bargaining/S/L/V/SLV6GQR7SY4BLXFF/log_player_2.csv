"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the game. I'm playing as Bob. My goal is to maximize my gain, considering the 20% inflation per round for me and the 5% inflation for Alice. I also need to be mindful of the 12-round limit.

Let's analyze Alice's offer in Round 1:

*   **Bob's gain:** $300,000
*   **Alice's gain:** $700,000

If I reject, the money's value will decrease for both of us next round.

Let's calculate the future value of $300,000 with the passing rounds. 
If I accept, my current value would be $300,000. If I reject and get to propose in round 2, here is what Alice would need to accept given her inflation rate.

Round 2: (Assuming Alice wants to get her $700,000)
$700,000 * (1.05) = $735,000
Therefore, I could propose:
Bob: $265,000
Alice: $735,000

Let's factor in my inflation:
$265,000 * (0.8) = $212,000
The inflation is hurting me much more than it hurts her.

Therefore, I should accept this round since it seems reasonable and I'm uncertain of what Alice may propose in the future.
