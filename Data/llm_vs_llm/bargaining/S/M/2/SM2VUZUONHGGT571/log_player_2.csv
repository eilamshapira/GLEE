"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer from Alice. She's proposing I get $600,000 and she gets $400,000 out of the $1,000,000. This is a 60/40 split in my favor.

If I reject, I can make my own offer next round, but I'll face 5% inflation, meaning the total money would be worth 5% less to me. If I accept now, I get $600,000.

This is actually a fairly generous first offer from Alice. A 60/40 split in my favor is better than an even split, and avoiding inflation is valuable.
