"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. It's a perfectly equal split (5000$ each)
2. It's the first round, so no inflation has occurred yet
3. There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in later rounds
4. Alice is being fair with a 50-50 split

{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a fair offer and accepting it ensures I get a good amount without risking inflation or potential worse offers in future rounds."
