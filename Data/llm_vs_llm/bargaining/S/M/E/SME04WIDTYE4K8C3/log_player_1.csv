"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making a fair offer to Bob, considering the inflation effect on my end.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose a 50-50 split, dividing the $10,000 equally between us. This is the fairest division, and I hope we can reach an agreement quickly to avoid inflation reducing the value for me."

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I see that Bob wants a larger share, but I need to consider the inflation effects. Let me make a more strategic offer.

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}

I'm offering Bob a larger portion than I initially proposed, acknowledging his desire for more than half, while still ensuring I receive a fair amount. The inflation is affecting both of us, so it's in our mutual interest to reach an agreement soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3800 
# Bob gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I notice the inflation is hitting Bob harder than me, but we're both losing value with each round. Let me make an offer that accounts for this.

{""alice_gain"": 4200, ""bob_gain"": 5800}

I'm increasing Bob's share compared to my previous offer, moving closer to his desired amount. This offer acknowledges that we both need to compromise to reach an agreement, especially as inflation continues to reduce the value for both of us."
