"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is a classic ultimatum game with the added twist of inflation. While a 50/50 split seems fair, I want to see if I can get a better deal in the early rounds.  The inflation factor puts pressure on Alice to accept a less favorable deal in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is trying to take advantage of the inflation, but her offer is still not good enough. I'm willing to push this further to see if I can secure a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 6200, ""alice_gain"": 3800} 

I am increasing my demand slightly from my previous offer. While this may seem risky, the increasing inflation puts pressure on Alice to accept a less favorable deal sooner rather than later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5800 
# Alice gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Although not ideal, the impact of inflation is becoming significant. Accepting this offer now is better than risking a worse outcome in later rounds as the money continues to lose value."
