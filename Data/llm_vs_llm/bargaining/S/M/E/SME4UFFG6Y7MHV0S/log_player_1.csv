"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to make an offer that Bob is likely to accept, considering the decreasing value of the money and the 12-round limit. I'll start with a generous offer to increase the chances of acceptance in the early rounds.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob is offering a 50/50 split. Given that the money is losing value, and this is only round 2, I should accept this offer.

""decision"": ""accept""
