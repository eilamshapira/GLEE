"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that we both want to avoid the inflation penalty. Let's compromise with a 55-45 split in my favor. This way, we both get a fair share while minimizing the impact of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

If I accept now:
- I get $450,000 but it's worth 10% less due to inflation = $405,000 effective value
- If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount I get will be worth another 10% less

If I had accepted my initial offer, I would have gotten $600,000.
Bob's current offer gives me $405,000 in effective value.

While this is less than my initial proposal, rejecting would mean facing another 10% penalty in the next round, which would make it hard to recover the difference. Even if I made a more aggressive proposal, Bob could reject it, leading to further losses from inflation.
