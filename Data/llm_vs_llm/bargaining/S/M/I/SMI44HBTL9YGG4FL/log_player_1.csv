"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll still get a substantial amount.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be more reasonable, a 55-45 split is more fair considering the decreasing value of money in each round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept now, I get $45, but it's worth 20% less than in round 1, so effectively $36
2. If I reject, I can make another offer, but the money will be worth even less in the next round
3. Bob's reasoning about decreasing value is valid
4. The longer we negotiate, the less value we both get
