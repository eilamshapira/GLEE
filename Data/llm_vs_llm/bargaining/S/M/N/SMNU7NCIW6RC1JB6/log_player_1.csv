"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. It's Round 1, I'm Alice, and I need to make an offer to Bob to divide $10,000, keeping inflation in mind.

Here's my offer in JSON format:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

My reasoning:  I'm proposing a split that gives me a slightly larger share. While ideally I would go for something closer to 70/30, I want to make an offer that Bob is likely to accept in this first round to avoid the inflation penalty.  $4000 is a significant amount, and hopefully, Bob will find it acceptable rather than risk getting less in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I see Bob rejected my initial offer and now he's making one. He's offering me $4500.

Before making a decision, I need to calculate the effective value of his offer compared to the original $10,000. Since I am losing 20% due to inflation, I calculate the equivalent value of the original amount:

10000 * 0.8 = 8000

Given this adjustment, I should compare Bob's offer to this new amount.
Bob is offering me $4500. With this value I am receiving more than half of the total amount adjusted for inflation.

Therefore, I will accept his offer.

```json
{
 ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
