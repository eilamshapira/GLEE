"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a division that considers both the different inflation rates and the need to reach an agreement. Since Bob's inflation rate (20%) is higher than mine (5%), he has more incentive to agree quickly, but I still want to make a fair offer.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This is a reasonable 60-40 split that gives Bob a significant portion while acknowledging my stronger negotiating position due to the inflation rates."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Due to inflation:
- For me, $4500 is now worth $4275 (95% of original value)
- For Bob, $5500 is now worth $4400 (80% of original value)

2. If I reject and propose in the next round:
- Values will decrease further (I'll lose another 5%, Bob another 20%)
- I could propose a better split, but Bob might reject again
- We have limited rounds, and the total value keeps decreasing

3. This offer still gives me a reasonable amount, and we avoid further value loss from inflation.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

The decreasing value due to inflation makes it risky to keep negotiating, and this offer, while not ideal, is still reasonable."
