"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. This is the first round, so no inflation has occurred yet
2. Alice is offering me 40% ($4000) and keeping 60% ($6000)
3. If I reject:
   - Next round I can make an offer
   - But my money will be worth 20% less
   - Her money will only be worth 5% less
   - This significant inflation difference puts me at a disadvantage

While 40/60 split isn't exactly fair, given the asymmetric inflation rates that hurt me much more than Alice, accepting a decent offer early might be better than trying to negotiate for more and losing value to inflation.

However, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round, even accounting for inflation.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that this is round 2:
1. My money will be worth 20% less, so I need to account for that
2. Alice's money will be worth 5% less
3. I should make a reasonable offer that Alice is likely to accept, as continued negotiation hurts me more than her

I'll propose a more balanced split that still compensates me for the inflation I've already taken:

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

This gives me 55% and Alice 45%, which is fair considering:
- The initial 40/60 split she proposed was too much in her favor
- I need to make up for some of the 20% inflation hit I've taken
- It's still attractive enough for Alice to consider accepting rather than moving to round 3 where she'll face 5% more inflation"
