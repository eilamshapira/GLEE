"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and avoid further inflation. A 60/40 split seems reasonable for a quick agreement. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer. Alice is proposing that I get $4,000 (40%) while she gets $6,000 (60%).

If I reject this offer, I'll make a counter-proposal in the next round, but the total amount will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation (so the $10,000 would effectively be worth $9,500 to me).

While a 50/50 split might seem most fair, I need to consider the inflation penalty. If I reject and propose a better split next round, Alice might reject my offer, leading to further inflation and potentially worse outcomes for both of us.

Given the inflation penalty and the reasonable (though not equal) split that Alice offered, I'll accept.
