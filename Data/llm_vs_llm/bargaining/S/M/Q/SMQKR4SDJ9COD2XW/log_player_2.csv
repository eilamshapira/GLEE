"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the offer is in the first round, the full amount of $1,000,000 is still available. Considering Alice's offer, I would get $475,000 and she would get $525,000. This seems a bit unfair to me, as I'm Bob and I want a more equal split or at least closer to half.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, now it's my turn to make a proposal. Considering the game's rules and the fact that the money will be worth 20% less for me with each passing round, I want to make a reasonable offer to Alice while also trying to get a good share for myself.

My offer is:
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

This is a 50-50 split, which seems fair to me. Let's see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Alice rejected my previous offer, now she's making a new proposal. However, I need to consider the inflation effect on my potential gain. The money I gain is worth 36% less than in the first round, which means that the $450,000 she's offering me is actually worth $450,000 * (1 - 0.36) = $450,000 * 0.64 = $288,000 in real value.

On the other hand, Alice's gain is worth 9.75% less, but that's her concern, not mine.

Considering this, I think Alice's offer is still not in my favor, especially since the real value of my gain is significantly lower due to inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, now it's my turn to make a new proposal. Considering the inflation effect, the money is worth 36% less for me, and with each round, it will decrease further. I need to make a reasonable offer to Alice while trying to get a good share for myself.

Taking into account the decreased value of the money for me, I'll make an offer that's slightly more favorable to Alice, hoping she'll accept it.

My offer is:
{""bob_gain"": 460000, ""alice_gain"": 540000}

This offer gives me a bit less than half, considering the inflation effect on my gain. Let's see how Alice responds!"
