"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer to Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60/40 split, where I receive $600,000 and Bob receives $400,000. This gives Bob a substantial portion while allowing me to account for the inflation penalty I'll face if we need additional rounds."
