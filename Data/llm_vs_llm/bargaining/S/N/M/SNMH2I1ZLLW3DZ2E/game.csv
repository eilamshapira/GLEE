6000.0,4000.0,Let's start fair.  I'll take 60% and you get 40%.  What do you say?,Alice,1,

2857.0,7143.0,"Alice, considering the future discounting – with money devaluing 10% for me and 20% for you each round – your best alternative if you wait is about an effective $2286. To avoid further loss you’d get roughly $2857 nominal if you become proposer next round. Thus, I propose to split the $10000 so that I receive $7143 and you receive $2857, which gives you exactly your continuation value in today’s terms. I hope you agree to close the deal now.",Bob,2,
