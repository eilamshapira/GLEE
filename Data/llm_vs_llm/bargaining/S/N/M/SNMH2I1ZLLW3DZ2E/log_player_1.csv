"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the future discounting – with money devaluing 10% for me and 20% for you each round – your best alternative if you wait is about an effective $2286. To avoid further loss you’d get roughly $2857 nominal if you become proposer next round. Thus, I propose to split the $10000 so that I receive $7143 and you receive $2857, which gives you exactly your continuation value in today’s terms. I hope you agree to close the deal now. 
# Alice gain: 2857 
# Bob gain: 7143 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
