"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I'll take 60% and you get 40%.  What do you say?

# Alice gain: 6000

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 7143, ""alice_gain"": 2857, ""message"": ""Alice, considering the future discounting – with money devaluing 10% for me and 20% for you each round – your best alternative if you wait is about an effective $2286. To avoid further loss you’d get roughly $2857 nominal if you become proposer next round. Thus, I propose to split the $10,000 so that I receive $7143 and you receive $2857, which gives you exactly your continuation value in today’s terms. I hope you agree to close the deal now.""}"
