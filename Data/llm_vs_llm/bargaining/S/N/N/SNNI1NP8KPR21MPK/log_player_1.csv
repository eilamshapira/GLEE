"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the offer and the inflation.

Considering the inflation:

*   My money is worth 80% of its original value (100% - 20% = 80%)
*   Bob's money is worth 90% of its original value (100% - 10% = 90%)

If I accept this offer:

*   My effective gain: 40 \* 0.80 = 32
*   Bob's effective gain: 60 \* 0.90 = 54

Therefore, I will **reject** this offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for round 3, taking inflation into account:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
