60.0,40.0,Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement quickly due to inflation.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, I propose we divide the $100 with $55 for me and $45 for you. I believe this is a fair compromise given the inflation risk and the need to reach an agreement quickly. Let's settle now before further rounds diminish our gains.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, let's meet in the middle. I'm offering you $45 and I'll take $55. This is a fair compromise, and with inflation affecting my gains each round, we should reach an agreement soon. This offer is better for you than my first proposal.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
40.0,60.0,"Hi Alice, given the continued effects of inflation on your share and the risk of further devaluation, I propose a division where I receive $60 and you receive $40. By accepting now, you secure your payout at a value that might be better than what could result in subsequent rounds. Let's agree now and avoid additional loss.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
52.0,48.0,"Bob, I'm making a more generous offer to you now - $48 for you and $52 for me. With inflation reducing my effective gains each round, this is a very reasonable split. Let's not waste more time as it only hurts both of us. Please accept this fair proposal.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
35.0,65.0,"Hi Alice, with the inflation biting into your share as we progress, waiting will only further reduce the actual value of your portion. I propose that I take $65 and you receive $35. Accepting this deal now secures your $35 before the devaluation worsens. Let's settle this round and avoid unnecessary further loss for both of us.",Bob,6,
