"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement quickly due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose we divide the $100 with $55 for me and $45 for you. I believe this is a fair compromise given the inflation risk and the need to reach an agreement quickly. Let's settle now before further rounds diminish our gains. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer since I can still make a better proposal in the next round, even accounting for the 5% inflation penalty."

Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Bob, let's meet in the middle. I'm offering you $45 and I'll take $55.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, given the continued effects of inflation on your share and the risk of further devaluation, I propose a division where I receive $60 and you receive $40. By accepting now, you secure your payout at a value that might be better than what could result in subsequent rounds. Let's agree now and avoid additional loss. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer as it's worse than the previous ones. Even with inflation affecting my share, I can still propose a better split in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Bob, I'm making a more generous offer to you now - $48 for you and $52 for me. With inflation reducing my effective gains each round, this is a very reasonable split. Let's not waste more time as it only hurts both of us. Please accept this fair proposal.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, with the inflation biting into your share as we progress, waiting will only further reduce the actual value of your portion. I propose that I take $65 and you receive $35. Accepting this deal now secures your $35 before the devaluation worsens. Let's settle this round and avoid unnecessary further loss for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because with the increasing inflation penalty (now at 22.62%), continuing to negotiate might lead to worse outcomes. My $35 now is worth more than a potentially higher nominal amount in later rounds, and Bob seems to be taking an increasingly aggressive stance in negotiations."
