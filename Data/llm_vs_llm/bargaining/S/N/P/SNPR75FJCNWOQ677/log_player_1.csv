"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a reasonable first offer, considering that time pressure affects me more than Bob due to the 20% inflation per round.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this 60-40 split because it's fair while giving me a slight advantage as the first mover. If Bob declines, my next opportunity will already be worth 20% less to me, so this is a generous initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The offer is too low, especially considering I was offering a more balanced split. With inflation, $400,000 is only worth $320,000 to me now, while Bob's $600,000 maintains full value. I'll make a better counteroffer in the next round, though I need to be mindful that further delays will reduce my purchasing power even more."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that my money is now worth 40% less due to two rounds of inflation passing, I need to adjust my offer to maintain reasonable value for myself while still being attractive to Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}

I'm proposing this 65-35 split because my $650,000 is only worth $390,000 to me now due to inflation, while Bob's $350,000 maintains its full value. This is still a reasonable offer that gives us both substantial value, and further delays would only hurt my position more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because:
1. With 48.8% inflation, my $450,000 is worth about $230,400 to me
2. If I reject, the next round will have 60% inflation, making any future gains worth even less
3. Bob has increased his offer from the previous $400,000, showing willingness to compromise
4. We're already in round 4, and with 12 rounds total, prolonging the negotiation becomes increasingly risky for me
5. This is a reasonable compromise that gives us both substantial value"
