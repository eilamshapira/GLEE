"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I want to ensure a fair division while considering the 5% inflation that affects me with each passing round. Since this is round 1, I'll propose a reasonable split that gives Bob a good portion to encourage acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering you $4,500, which is a substantial portion of the money. This is a fair offer considering I face 5% inflation with each passing round. Let's settle this now so we both walk away with a good amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I see we're both looking for similar amounts. Let me offer a compromise that accounts for the inflation I'm facing.

{""alice_gain"": 5300, ""bob_gain"": 4700}

Bob, I'm offering you $4,700, which is $200 more than my initial proposal. Since I face a 5% inflation penalty with each round while you don't, this is a fair compromise. We're now in round 3, which means I've already lost 10% of my money's value. Let's come to an agreement and avoid further devaluation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I notice Bob is asking for more with each round, taking advantage of the inflation penalty I'm facing. Let me be strategic but fair.

{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200}

Bob, I'm offering you $4,200. We're now in round 5, which means I've already lost nearly 20% of my money's value due to inflation, while you face no such penalty. This offer accounts for that disadvantage. If we keep going back and forth, I'll lose even more to inflation, but you'll also risk getting nothing if we reach round 12 without agreement. Let's be reasonable and settle now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800
