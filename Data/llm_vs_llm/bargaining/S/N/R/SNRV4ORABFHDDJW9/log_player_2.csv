"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if Alice's offer is fair, given that inflation affects her but not me.

If we reach the final round (12), Alice will experience about 46% inflation, meaning $5,500 would be worth only about $2,970 to her. For me, $4,500 would still be worth $4,500 since I don't face inflation.

I can likely get a better deal by rejecting this and making a counter-offer. Since time affects Alice more negatively than me, I should use this strategic advantage.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that acknowledges our different positions regarding inflation. Since Alice faces 5% inflation per round and I don't, I can propose a division that's actually fair when considering the time value of money.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering Alice $4,500 which is better for her to accept now than to continue negotiating, as her money will lose value with each round. This split is fair considering our asymmetric positions regarding inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to reconsider. Alice has improved her offer to me slightly from $4,500 to $4,700, while reducing her share to $5,300.

With each round, Alice's money loses 5% more value due to inflation, which puts her in a disadvantageous position. Already in this round, she's facing 9.75% inflation, meaning her $5,300 is effectively worth about $4,783 to her.

If we continue to the next round, she'll face even more inflation, weakening her position further. I could reject and counter with a higher amount for myself, but I risk prolonging negotiations when she's already making concessions.

However, since I don't face inflation, I still have a strategic advantage and can likely negotiate a better deal for myself.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more aggressive counter-offer given my inflation-resistant position. Alice faces increasingly worse inflation with each round (approximately 5% more per round), so accepting sooner is in her interest.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

This offer gives Alice $4,000 now, which is better than waiting for future rounds where inflation will continue to reduce the real value of her share. Given our asymmetric inflation exposure, this division acknowledges the time pressure that affects her but not me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice has actually decreased her offer to me from $4,700 to $4,200, which is surprising given the inflation pressure she faces. Her $5,800 is now worth only about $4,724 to her due to the 18.55% inflation she's experiencing.

This move suggests she may be trying to establish a stronger negotiating position despite her disadvantage. However, this offer is worse for me than her previous one, which doesn't make strategic sense.

Given that I don't face inflation and we still have 7 rounds left, I should reject this offer. The inflation pressure on Alice will continue to grow, improving my bargaining position.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll maintain a strong position while making a slight concession from my previous offer to encourage Alice to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200}

This offer gives Alice $4,200, which is becoming increasingly valuable for her to accept now rather than later, as inflation continues to reduce the value of her potential gains in future rounds. By round 12, her inflation would be around 46%, making any amount significantly less valuable to her. This division acknowledges our asymmetric inflation exposure while still being reasonable enough that she should consider accepting to avoid further erosion of her share's value."
