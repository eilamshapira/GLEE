Alice is trying to prolong the game, and I suspect the devaluation might not be affecting her as much as it affects me. I'll make another offer that's still fair but slightly better for me this time. Let's see how she reacts."

I want to see if Alice is willing to accept a slightly better offer for her, but still close to an even split. If she rejects this, I'll know she's trying to take advantage of me."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting desperate, inflation is killing me. This is as low as I'll go. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't believe that inflation is affecting Alice as much as she claims. I'll make another offer that's still fair but slightly worse for her this time. If she rejects this, I'll know she's not being honest about the effects of inflation on her.

I am taking a risk by rejecting this offer, but I believe that Alice is trying to take advantage of me, and I don't want to let her win. I think she is bluffing, let's see how she handles my next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 470000, ""alice_gain"": 530000, ""message"": ""I'm still trying to be fair, but I think you're being dishonest about the effects of inflation on you. Let's end this before the money loses more value for me.""}

If Alice rejects this offer, I'll know she's not being truthful about the effects of inflation on her, and I'll have to adjust my strategy accordingly. I'm taking a risk by making this offer, but I think it's worth it to find out if Alice is being honest or not. I still think she is bluffing, and I don't want to let her win."
