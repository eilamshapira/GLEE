"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, 50-50 split. What do you say, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if this offer is fair given the game's rules. Alice has proposed a 50-50 split, which would give me $50 and her $50. This is a perfectly equal division.

Given that:
1. Money loses 10% value each round
2. If I reject, I'll make the next offer
3. A perfectly equal split is generally considered fair

While I could reject and try to get more in the next round, the 10% inflation penalty means the total value would decrease to $90, so even if I got a larger percentage, the absolute amount might be less valuable.
