"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Since Alice's money loses 10% value each round, if I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2:
- Alice's $55 would only be worth $49.50 to her
- My $45 would still be worth $45 to me

I could potentially make a better offer for myself in the next round, since Alice would be more inclined to accept due to the depreciation. However, she might reject and make the negotiations drag on, leading to significant value loss for her.

The current offer of $45 for me is reasonable, and accepting now ensures we both get good value before depreciation kicks in.
