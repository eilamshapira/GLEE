"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game and the inflation rule for me. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   I'm offering Bob $400,000. This is a substantial amount and a good starting point.
*   I'm asking for $600,000 for myself. Given the potential for inflation reducing my gains in future rounds, I want to secure a larger portion upfront."
