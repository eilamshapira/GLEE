"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $400,000 out of $1,000,000
2. If I reject, the next round's money will be worth 20% less to me
3. In the next round, I can make a counter-offer, but Alice might reject it
4. After my rejection, $400,000 would be worth only $320,000 to me in the next round

While 40% isn't the most favorable split, rejecting would mean I need to propose something better that Alice would accept, while dealing with the 20% inflation penalty. The risk of further negotiations and value loss might not be worth it.
