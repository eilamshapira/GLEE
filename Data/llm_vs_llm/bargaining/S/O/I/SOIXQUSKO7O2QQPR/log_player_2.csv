"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 
Alice's offer gives me $400,000 and her $600,000.

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round. While my value stays the same, Alice's value will decrease by 5% next round due to inflation.

$600,000 * 0.95 = $570,000 would be Alice's maximum value next round.

This gives me negotiating leverage, as I could offer her something like $500,000 next round which would still be worth less to her than $600,000 is now, while potentially getting more for myself.

Given this dynamic and that we have many rounds left, I'll reject this initial offer to try to negotiate a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that Alice's value decreases by 5% each round, I can offer her slightly less than her previous offer while still giving her good value. This way I can increase my share while keeping it attractive for her.

Her $600,000 is now worth $570,000 to her due to 5% inflation.
I'll offer her $550,000 which is still a good deal for her considering the inflation, while improving my position.

{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000}

My offer splits the money more evenly while still giving Alice the majority. This should be appealing as it's worth more to her now than what she would get if she rejects and we continue to later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 425000 
# Alice gain: 575000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

Alice is offering me $425,000 and wants $575,000 for herself.

From Alice's perspective:
- Original value in round 1: $575,000
- Current value after 9.75% inflation: $575,000 * 0.9025 = $518,937.50

If I reject:
- Next round her money will be worth 14.25% less than round 1
- $575,000 * 0.8575 = $493,062.50 would be her maximum value next round

While this offer is better than her first offer ($425K vs $400K for me), I still think I can get a better deal. Given that Alice's value is decreasing significantly with each round and we still have 9 rounds left, I'll reject this offer to try to negotiate a better split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that Alice's value has decreased by 14.25% from round 1, I can now make a more aggressive offer while still keeping it attractive for her.

Let's calculate:
- If Alice gets $575,000 now, it's worth only $493,062.50 to her due to inflation
- If I offer her $525,000, it's worth $450,187.50 to her after inflation
- This is still a significant amount, and she should consider it seriously given that further delays will reduce her value even more

I'll propose a more balanced split that takes advantage of the inflation effect while still giving Alice a good incentive to accept:

{""bob_gain"": 475000, ""alice_gain"": 525000}

This offer gives me a better share while still providing Alice with a substantial amount that's worth accepting now rather than risking further depreciation in later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

Alice is offering me $450,000 and wants $550,000 for herself.

From Alice's perspective:
- Original value in round 1: $550,000
- Current value after 18.55% inflation: $550,000 * 0.8145 = $447,975

If I reject:
- Next round her money will be worth 22.85% less than round 1
- $550,000 * 0.7715 = $424,325 would be her maximum value next round

This offer is getting more reasonable:
1. I'm being offered $450,000 (up from $400,000 in round 1)
2. Alice's share is worth significantly less to her due to inflation
3. We've used 5 rounds already, and further delays will hurt Alice more

Given that this is a substantial improvement from previous offers and the risk of running out of rounds increases, I'll accept this offer.
