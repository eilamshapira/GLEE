Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. This way, we both have a good starting point, and we can see if we can negotiate something better in the next rounds.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a fair 50-50 split. This gives us both an equal share of $500000, which seems more reasonable than the previous 90-10 division. Since there's no inflation cost to negotiating for either of us, we should aim for fairness. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
