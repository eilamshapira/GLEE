"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. This way, we both have a good starting point, and we can see if we can negotiate something better in the next rounds. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get 10% ($100,000) while she gets 90% ($900,000). This doesn't seem like a fair division, and since there's no inflation for me, I don't lose value by continuing to the next round where I can make a counter-offer.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. This gives us both an equal share of $500,000, which seems more reasonable than the previous 90-10 division. Since there's no inflation cost to negotiating for either of us, we should aim for fairness.""}"
