"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 99.99, ""bob_gain"": 0.01, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, Iâ€™m proposing this division to avoid any further loss from delay. Since waiting will reduce your $100 by 5% per round, accepting now gets you $0.01 instead of essentially nothing later. Let's settle this immediately!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my funds are discounted by 5% each round while yours are not. To avoid even greater losses on my end, I'm offering you the full $100 now. Let's conclude the negotiation quickly and settle this. 
# Alice gain: 100 
# Bob gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
