"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, Iâ€™m proposing this division to avoid any further loss from delay. Since waiting will reduce your $100 by 5% per round, accepting now gets you $0.01 instead of essentially nothing later. Let's settle this immediately! 
# Bob gain: 0.01 
# Alice gain: 99.99 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
