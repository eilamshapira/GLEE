"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to avoid the 20% inflation penalty from extending negotiations.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I reject your previous offer because it was too biased. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor, considering the inflation penalty, it's a reasonable offer to avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. If I accept Bob's offer now:
   * I get $450,000 with 20% inflation penalty
   * My actual value = $450,000 Ã— 0.8 = $360,000

2. If I reject and make a new offer next round:
   * The money will be worth another 20% less for me
   * Maximum I could get would be worth even less due to 40% total inflation
   * There's no guarantee Bob would accept my next offer

Given that:
1. The inflation is hurting my position significantly
2. $360,000 is still a substantial amount
3. Further negotiations would reduce my potential gains even more
4. Bob's offer is relatively fair considering the circumstances
