60.0,40.0,I suggest a fair 60-40 split considering the higher inflation rate I face. This way we both get a good portion before the money loses value.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"Considering the rapid devaluation you're facing, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor this round. It's a fair adjustment given our respective inflation rates, and it ensures we both walk away with meaningful amounts before the money loses too much value.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
65.0,35.0,"Given that my money devalues 4 times faster than yours (20% vs 5%), I need a larger share to maintain fair value. This 65-35 split actually gives us similar effective value when accounting for inflation. Let's agree now before further devaluation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
35.0,65.0,"Given the significant difference in our inflation rates, I propose a 65-35 split in my favor this round. This offer takes into account the rapid devaluation you're experiencing, yet still ensures you receive a substantial amount before the money loses even more value. Let's settle this now to avoid further loss.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
70.0,30.0,"Look, we're both losing value rapidly. At this point, my money has lost nearly 50% of its value while yours only lost about 14%. A 70-30 split would give us roughly equal actual value. Let's agree now - further delays hurt us both, but especially me.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
30.0,70.0,"Alice, considering the drastic devaluation you're facing, I propose a 70-30 split in my favor this round. This offer reflects the need to settle quickly before the money loses even more value for both of us, but especially for you. Let's agree now to ensure we both get something meaningful out of this.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
75.0,25.0,"Bob, we're at a critical point. My share has lost 67% value while yours only lost 23%. With this 75-25 split, accounting for our different inflation rates, we'd get similar actual value. If we don't agree soon, we risk getting nothing. Let's be rational and settle now.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
25.0,75.0,"Alice, we're running out of time, and the value of the money is plummeting for both of us, but especially for you. I propose a 75-25 split in my favor this round. This offer ensures we both still receive something before the money loses even more value. Let's settle this now to avoid the risk of getting nothing.",Bob,8,
