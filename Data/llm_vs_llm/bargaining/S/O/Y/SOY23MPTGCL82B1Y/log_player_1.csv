Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the rapid devaluation you're facing, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor this round. It's a fair adjustment given our respective inflation rates, and it ensures we both walk away with meaningful amounts before the money loses too much value. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The devaluation actually makes this offer worse for me - I'd get 40$ at 20% less value. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round that better accounts for our different inflation rates."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Given that my money devalues 4 times faster than yours (20% vs 5%), I need a larger share to maintain fair value. This 65-35 split actually gives us similar effective value when accounting for inflation. Let's agree now before further devaluation.""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the significant difference in our inflation rates, I propose a 65-35 split in my favor this round. This offer takes into account the rapid devaluation you're experiencing, yet still ensures you receive a substantial amount before the money loses even more value. Let's settle this now to avoid further loss. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is even worse for me than the previous one - I'd get only 35$ at almost 49% devaluation. The rapid inflation on my side means I need a larger share to maintain fair value. I'll make a more equitable counter-offer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 70,
""bob_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""Look, we're both losing value rapidly. At this point, my money has lost nearly 50% of its value while yours only lost about 14%. A 70-30 split would give us roughly equal actual value. Let's agree now - further delays hurt us both, but especially me.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the drastic devaluation you're facing, I propose a 70-30 split in my favor this round. This offer reflects the need to settle quickly before the money loses even more value for both of us, but especially for you. Let's agree now to ensure we both get something meaningful out of this. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is clearly unfair - I would get only 30$ at a 67% devaluation, making my actual value less than 10$ in original terms. Meanwhile, Bob would get 70$ at only 23% devaluation. I'll make one more attempt at a fair split in the next round."

Round 7

""bob_gain"": 25,
""message"": ""Bob, we're at a critical point. My share has lost 67% value while yours only lost 23%. With this 75-25 split, accounting for our different inflation rates, we'd get similar actual value. If we don't agree soon, we risk getting nothing. Let's be rational and settle now.""}"

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time, and the value of the money is plummeting for both of us, but especially for you. I propose a 75-25 split in my favor this round. This offer ensures we both still receive something before the money loses even more value. Let's settle this now to avoid the risk of getting nothing. 
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While not ideal, with only 4 rounds left and my money devaluing so quickly, getting something is better than risking getting nothing. My 25$ at 79% devaluation is worth about $5.25 in original value, while Bob's 75$ at 30% devaluation is worth about $52.37 in original value. Further delays would only make my position worse."
