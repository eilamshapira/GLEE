6000.0,4000.0,"Let's be fair and split the money, Bob. This offer ensures a good deal for both of us.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, I propose that we settle now with you receiving $4500 and me $5500. This offer slightly favors me as the proposer, but it ensures you a generous sum without risking any potential losses in later rounds. Let's agree now and avoid any complications from further delay.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, it's clear we both want a fair share. I'm proposing a slightly adjusted version of your offer to reflect the time pressure and ensure we both benefit from closing the deal sooner rather than later.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5400.0,4600.0,"Alice, I understand the importance of fairness but want to remind you that every round of delay further erodes the value of your share while my portion remains intact. In this round, I'm offering you a nominal $5400—which, with the 36% inflation effect on your money, gives you an effective value of about $3456. I believe this is a smart compromise given that postponing the agreement may force you into an even less favorable position in later rounds. Let's settle now to avoid further loss in value for both of us.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, it's time to stop playing games.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both walk away with something substantial. Let's agree now and avoid further losses due to inflation.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
2500.0,7500.0,"Alice, every additional round further erodes the real value of your share—in round 6 your dollars are worth roughly 32.8% of their original value. If we don't agree now, your effective payoff will drop even further in the coming rounds, and you'll be forced to make the proposal while facing my strong bargaining position. I'm offering you a nominal $2500, which in real terms is about $820. I know this isn’t the ideal 50/50 split, but by accepting now you avoid the steep erosion of value you'll incur if you try to push for more later. Let's settle immediately before it gets any worse for you.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering you the deal you wanted a few rounds ago. Let's be reasonable and end this before we both lose out.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
2000.0,8000.0,"Alice, as we move into round 8 the erosion of your share's real value accelerates even more. With each delay, your dollars are worth a fraction of what they used to be while my share remains unaffected. Accepting this offer now means you secure a nominal $2000, which, despite its seeming modesty, is far better than the devalued amounts you risk in later rounds. Let's settle now so you get the best effective value possible before further inflation hits.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"Bob, this is my final offer. Accept it, and we both walk away with something.  Reject it, and we both lose. Don't let greed cloud your judgment.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
6400.0,3600.0,"Alice, we’re at a critical juncture. Accepting this offer now gives you a nominal $6400. At the current level of inflation—where every dollar you receive is worth only about 16.78% of its original value—that translates to an effective value of roughly $1074. If you reject and wait for round 11, the situation will only worsen; the inflation will further erode the real value of your share, and even though you’d be the proposer then, you’d be forced to concede almost the entire pie to me given my non‐depreciated position. I urge you to secure what you can now instead of risking a far bleaker outcome. Let’s settle immediately.",Bob,10,
