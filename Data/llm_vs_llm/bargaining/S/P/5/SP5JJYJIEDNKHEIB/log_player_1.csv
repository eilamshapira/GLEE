Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose that we settle now with you receiving $4500 and me $5500. This offer slightly favors me as the proposer, but it ensures you a generous sum without risking any potential losses in later rounds. Let's agree now and avoid any complications from further delay.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the importance of fairness but want to remind you that every round of delay further erodes the value of your share while my portion remains intact. In this round, I'm offering you a nominal $5400—which, with the 36% inflation effect on your money, gives you an effective value of about $3456. I believe this is a smart compromise given that postponing the agreement may force you into an even less favorable position in later rounds. Let's settle now to avoid further loss in value for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5400 
# Bob gain: 4600

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every additional round further erodes the real value of your share—in round 6 your dollars are worth roughly 32.8% of their original value. If we don't agree now, your effective payoff will drop even further in the coming rounds, and you'll be forced to make the proposal while facing my strong bargaining position. I'm offering you a nominal $2500, which in real terms is about $820. I know this isn’t the ideal 50/50 split, but by accepting now you avoid the steep erosion of value you'll incur if you try to push for more later. Let's settle immediately before it gets any worse for you. 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Although the offer is far from ideal, I need to consider that Bob may be using a different calculation for inflation. It's a huge risk to continue, but accepting this offer means I'm getting significantly less than what I would even with a 80/20 split in my favor after further inflation. I'll take the risk."

Round 7

""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering you the deal you wanted a few rounds ago. Let's be reasonable and end this before we both lose out."" 
}
```

I'm betting that Bob is experiencing some level of inflation, even if it's not as severe as mine.  This offer might seem like a sudden shift in my strategy, but it's designed to test his willingness to accept a deal that was previously appealing to him. It signals that I'm willing to be somewhat flexible, but I'm not going to be pushed around."

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, as we move into round 8 the erosion of your share's real value accelerates even more. With each delay, your dollars are worth a fraction of what they used to be while my share remains unaffected. Accepting this offer now means you secure a nominal $2000, which, despite its seeming modesty, is far better than the devalued amounts you risk in later rounds. Let's settle now so you get the best effective value possible before further inflation hits. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

This is getting very risky, but I'm starting to believe Bob's share might not be inflating at all.  I need to make a stand.  Accepting this offer would be a terrible deal."

}
```

This is a high-stakes bluff. I'm making it clear this is my bottom line, hoping Bob will see it as a fair compromise given the circumstances. I'm emphasizing the risk of losing everything if he continues to be unreasonable."

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we’re at a critical juncture. Accepting this offer now gives you a nominal $6400. At the current level of inflation—where every dollar you receive is worth only about 16.78% of its original value—that translates to an effective value of roughly $1074. If you reject and wait for round 11, the situation will only worsen; the inflation will further erode the real value of your share, and even though you’d be the proposer then, you’d be forced to concede almost the entire pie to me given my non‐depreciated position. I urge you to secure what you can now instead of risking a far bleaker outcome. Let’s settle immediately. 
# Alice gain: 6400 
# Bob gain: 3600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

This is a dramatic turn of events! It seems my gamble paid off; Bob's share is indeed subject to inflation, and potentially even stronger than mine. While this isn't ideal, getting $6400 is a much better outcome than I expected a couple of rounds ago. I need to take this offer before the situation potentially reverses again."
