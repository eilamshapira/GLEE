This offer slightly favors me as the proposer, but it ensures you a generous sum without risking any potential losses in later rounds. Let's agree now and avoid any complications from further delay.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a fair share. I'm proposing a slightly adjusted version of your offer to reflect the time pressure and ensure we both benefit from closing the deal sooner rather than later.

In this round, I'm offering you a nominal $5,400—which, with the 36% inflation effect on your money, gives you an effective value of about $3,456. I believe this is a smart compromise given that postponing the agreement may force you into an even less favorable position in later rounds. Let's settle now to avoid further loss in value for both of us.""}"

If we don't agree now, your effective payoff will drop even further in the coming rounds, and you'll be forced to make the proposal while facing my strong bargaining position. I'm offering you a nominal $2,500, which in real terms is about $820. I know this isn’t the ideal 50/50 split, but by accepting now you avoid the steep erosion of value you'll incur if you try to push for more later. Let's settle immediately before it gets any worse for you.""}"

With each delay, your dollars are worth a fraction of what they used to be while my share remains unaffected. Accepting this offer now means you secure a nominal $2000, which, despite its seeming modesty, is far better than the devalued amounts you risk in later rounds.

Round 10
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 3600, ""alice_gain"": 6400, ""message"": ""Alice, we’re at a critical juncture. Accepting this offer now gives you a nominal $6,400. At the current level of inflation—where every dollar you receive is worth only about 16.78% of its original value—that translates to an effective value of roughly $1,074. If you reject and wait for round 11, the situation will only worsen; the inflation will further erode the real value of your share, and even though you’d be the proposer then, you’d be forced to concede almost the entire pie to me given my non‐depreciated position. I urge you to secure what you can now instead of risking a far bleaker outcome. Let’s settle immediately.""}"
