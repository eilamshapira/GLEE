"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 0, ""bob_gain"": 100, ""message"": ""Hi Bob – here’s my proposal: I take nothing, and you get all $100. If you reject, you’ll get to propose in Round 2 and still secure nearly the full $100, while any delay only hurts my share due to the 20% per-round discount. I believe it’s best for both of us to conclude the game now. What do you say?""}"
