"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob – here’s my proposal: I take nothing, and you get all $100. If you reject, you’ll get to propose in Round 2 and still secure nearly the full $100, while any delay only hurts my share due to the 20% per-round discount. I believe it’s best for both of us to conclude the game now. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 100 
# Alice gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Alice's offer is actually quite generous, giving me the full $100. She's correct that the inflation affects her more than me (20% vs 0% per round). 

If I reject, I could propose in Round 2, but:
1. I can't get more than $100 anyway
2. Any delay would only hurt Alice's potential gain
3. This is already the best possible outcome for me

There's no strategic advantage in rejecting this offer since I can't improve my position.
