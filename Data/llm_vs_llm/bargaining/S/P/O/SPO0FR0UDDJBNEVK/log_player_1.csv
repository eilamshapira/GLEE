Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, I'm offering a more balanced split. Accepting now will save us both from potential losses due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
