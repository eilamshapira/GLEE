"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Based on a backward‐induction analysis of this alternating‐offers game with discounting only on Alice’s side, the result is that Bob’s future “threat point” is extremely strong. (In later rounds Bob gets to propose a split without any discount on his share while every delay hurts Alice’s eventual money by 10% per round.) 

In round 1 you—playing as Alice—must offer Bob at least what he would expect to receive if he rejected your offer. Since if Bob rejects, in round 2 he becomes the proposer and, using his bargaining power (with no discount on his funds), he can force an outcome in which he gets essentially the entire $1,000,000. In equilibrium Bob’s “outside option” is $1,000,000. This forces you, as the proposer in round 1, to offer Bob the full $1,000,000 if you want him to accept. Any offer giving him even a cent less will be rejected in favor of his proposal in the next round where he obtains the whole pie.

Thus the subgame perfect equilibrium proposal for round 1 is:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 0,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000000
}

In words, you propose that Bob gets $1,000,000 and you get nothing. Although this may feel counter‐intuitive, it is the only proposal that Bob will be willing to accept given the discounting disadvantage you face in later rounds."
