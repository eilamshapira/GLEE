"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Alice is offering me 4000$ out of 10,000$, which is 40% of the total amount.
If I reject, I can make my own offer next round, but the money will be worth 5% less to me.
Current value for me: $4000
Next round value if I reject: $9500 total (5% less)

Since this is the first round and I still have many opportunities to negotiate, and the first offer is significantly in Alice's favor, I'll reject it and make a counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split, but slightly in my favor since Alice made a first offer that was significantly in her favor.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

This is a reasonable offer as it's closer to a 50-50 split, but gives me a small advantage. It's much more balanced than Alice's initial 40-60 split, and considering the time pressure and inflation effect on my end, it's important to reach a fair agreement soon."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice has increased her offer from $4000 to $4500
2. Due to 9.75% inflation for me:
   * $4500 is actually worth $4061.25 to me (4500 * 0.9025)
3. This is only a small improvement from her first offer
4. We still have 9 rounds left, but inflation is increasing
5. Alice seems to be moving towards a more balanced split, but slowly

While I could reject and push for more, the increasing inflation means I'm losing value with each round. Her offer is moving in the right direction, but still gives her a significant advantage.

Given the inflation pressure and risk of further devaluation, I'll accept this offer.
