500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, I'm proposing a 50-50 split which is fair to both of us. Consider that money loses value faster for you (20% per round) than for me (5% per round). Even if you counter-offer in the next round, your share would be worth less to you due to this higher inflation rate. This equal split is optimal for both of us.",Bob,2,
