"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous! Take this deal and let's finish this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $100,000 out of the $1,000,000, which means she would get $900,000. That's quite uneven in her favor.

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round. However, I should consider the inflation effects:
- For me, money will be worth 5% less next round
- For Alice, money will be worth 20% less next round

This means Alice has a stronger incentive to accept a deal now than I do. Given these dynamics, I should reject this uneven offer and propose a more favorable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer that takes into account our different inflation rates while still being fair.

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm proposing a 50-50 split which is fair to both of us. Consider that money loses value faster for you (20% per round) than for me (5% per round). Even if you counter-offer in the next round, your share would be worth less to you due to this higher inflation rate. This equal split is optimal for both of us.""}"
