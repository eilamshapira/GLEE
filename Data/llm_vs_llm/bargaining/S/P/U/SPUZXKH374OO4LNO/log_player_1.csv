"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob that takes into account the different inflation rates we both face.

{""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, since we both face inflation but yours is higher (20% vs my 5%), it makes sense to reach an agreement now. I'm offering you a substantial $4,500 which is fair considering our different inflation rates. If we delay, we both lose value, but you lose more than I do.""}"
