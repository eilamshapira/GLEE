600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. If you reject, the next round will reduce my purchasing power by 20%, making future negotiations less beneficial for both of us. This is a fair offer considering the time pressure I'm under.",Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,"Hi Alice, since money is now worth 20% less to you in this round, a fair adjustment would be for me to get 60% and you 40%. This gives you $400000 which is still worth $320000 to you in round 1 terms, while allowing me to improve my position. This is a balanced offer considering our different inflation rates.",Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I'm offering a 55-45 split. While my purchasing power has decreased by 40% this round, making my share worth $330000 in round 1 terms, this is still better than your previous offer. If you reject, my next round's position will be significantly weaker. This is a good compromise - you get more than my initial offer, and I maintain a reasonable share despite the inflation impact.",Alice,3,
