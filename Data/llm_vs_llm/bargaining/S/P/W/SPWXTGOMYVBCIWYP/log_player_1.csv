"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since money is now worth 20% less to you in this round, a fair adjustment would be for me to get 60% and you 40%. This gives you $400000 which is still worth $320000 to you in round 1 terms, while allowing me to improve my position. This is a balanced offer considering our different inflation rates. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The reason I'm rejecting is that even though Bob's logic about the 20% reduction is correct, I can still make a counter-offer in the next round. While my purchasing power will decrease further, I can try to negotiate a better split since we're still far from a point where the inflation would make a smaller share preferable to a larger but depreciated one."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering a 55-45 split. While my purchasing power has decreased by 40% this round, making my share worth $330,000 in round 1 terms, this is still better than your previous offer. If you reject, my next round's position will be significantly weaker. This is a good compromise - you get more than my initial offer, and I maintain a reasonable share despite the inflation impact.""}"
