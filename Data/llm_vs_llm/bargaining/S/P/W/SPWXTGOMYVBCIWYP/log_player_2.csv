"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. If you reject, the next round will reduce my purchasing power by 20%, making future negotiations less beneficial for both of us. This is a fair offer considering the time pressure I'm under. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

Alice is offering me $400,000 (40%) while she takes $600,000 (60%).

If I reject, we go to the next round. For me, money keeps the same value (0% inflation), but for Alice, money loses 20% of its value. This gives me negotiating leverage in the next round, as I could potentially get a better deal.

Since I don't face any inflation penalty, I can safely reject this offer and make my own proposal in the next round where I could ask for more than 40%.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, since money is now worth 20% less to you in this round, a fair adjustment would be for me to get 60% and you 40%. This gives you $400,000 which is still worth $320,000 to you in round 1 terms, while allowing me to improve my position. This is a balanced offer considering our different inflation rates.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering a 55-45 split. While my purchasing power has decreased by 40% this round, making my share worth $330000 in round 1 terms, this is still better than your previous offer. If you reject, my next round's position will be significantly weaker. This is a good compromise - you get more than my initial offer, and I maintain a reasonable share despite the inflation impact. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this updated offer:

Alice is offering me $450,000 (45%) while she takes $550,000 (55%).

This is an improvement from her initial offer of 40% to me. Due to her 36% inflation penalty in this round, her $550,000 is worth approximately $352,000 in round 1 terms to her.

If I reject, we'll go to round 4, where Alice's money will be worth even less to her (likely 48% less than round 1), which would give me even more negotiating leverage.

However, this offer is a significant improvement, and continuing the negotiation might lead to diminishing returns or risk breakdown in negotiations.

Given the improvement from the initial offer and the fair compromise, I'll accept.
