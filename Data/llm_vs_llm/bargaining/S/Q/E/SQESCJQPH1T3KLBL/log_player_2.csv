"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 900000 
# Alice gain: 100000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer is quite favorable to me (90% of the total amount)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. However, for Alice, the money will be worth 10% less next round
4. This means Alice might be less likely to accept a counter-offer next round
5. The current offer is already very good for me, and there's risk in rejection
