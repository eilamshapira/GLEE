"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a fair initial offer, considering that Bob's money loses value faster than mine, which might make him more eager to accept early.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm offering you a fair split considering our different inflation rates. You get $450K, I get $550K. If we delay, both our shares will be worth less, especially yours with 10% depreciation per round.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I believe in an equal split. Let's end this now and take our share before inflation eats away at it. Are you in? 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $500,000 at 95% value = $475,000 effective value
- If Bob accepted my previous offer, I would have gotten $550,000 at 100% value
- If I reject and make a new offer, any future acceptance will be at further reduced values
- Bob is facing worse inflation (10% per round) so he has more pressure to settle

However, this is still a reasonable offer, and the risk of further depreciation is significant. Getting $475,000 in effective value now is better than risking further rounds of negotiation where both our shares would be worth less.
