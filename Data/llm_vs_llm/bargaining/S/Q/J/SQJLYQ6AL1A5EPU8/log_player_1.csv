I'm starting with a very generous offer, hoping to secure a quick deal. I figure I can afford to give Bob a small amount and still have a great deal of the money."

I'm sticking with a high offer. This time, I'm offering a slightly smaller amount to Bob, but it's still a significant portion of the money. I'm hoping this will be enticing enough for him to accept, especially since the value of the money is decreasing for him with each passing round."

{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While it's slightly more generous than before, it's still far below what I believe I deserve.  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for Bob, and I'm confident that he'll be willing to negotiate more in the coming rounds."

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but I'm still aiming for a significant portion of the money.  I'm hoping that Bob will realize that time is running out and that he needs to accept a deal soon.  The decreasing value of the money for him should incentivize him to accept."

I'm lowering my offer again, but still aiming for a substantial portion of the money. Time is running out for both of us, and I think this offer is a fair compromise considering the decreasing value of money for Bob."
