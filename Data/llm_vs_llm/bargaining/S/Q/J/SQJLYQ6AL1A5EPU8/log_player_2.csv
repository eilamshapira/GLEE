"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that inflation decreases the money's value for me by 5% each round, I should carefully evaluate this offer.

Alice is offering me just 1% of the total ($10,000), which seems very unfair given we're supposed to divide $1,000,000. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value to me will be worth 5% less, but I could propose a much more favorable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more balanced offer that accounts for the inflation penalty I face.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing a fair division that slightly favors me to account for the inflation disadvantage I have in this negotiation. This gives you a substantial portion while recognizing that I lose 5% value each round we delay, which you don't experience."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has increased her offer from $10,000 to $50,000, but this is still only 5% of the total amount, which remains quite unfair. 

Due to inflation, the $1,000,000 is now worth 9.75% less to me than in the first round. If I reject and go to round 4, it will be worth 14.26% less. However, I can still make a more reasonable counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more reasonable offer that accounts for our positions while still addressing the inflation reality I face.

{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000}

I'm still proposing a fair division that slightly favors me to account for the inflation penalty I face. Since you don't experience any inflation effect, it's reasonable that we find a more balanced split. This gives you a substantial portion (48%) while acknowledging my disadvantage in the negotiation process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has increased her offer to $100,000, which is 10% of the total amount. While this is an improvement, it's still quite skewed in her favor.

The inflation penalty means the money is now worth 18.55% less to me than in round 1. If I reject and go to round 6, it will be worth 22.62% less. 

I need to consider that with each rejection, my negotiating position weakens due to inflation, while Alice's remains unchanged. However, $100,000 still seems too low given the initial equal standing.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll adjust my offer to reflect the changing dynamics of our negotiation, recognizing that my position weakens with each round due to inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000}

I'm proposing a division that now slightly favors you, acknowledging the inflation effect I face and that we're now halfway through our possible rounds. This gives you a majority share (52%) while still allowing me to receive a substantial portion. As time passes, finding a mutually acceptable agreement becomes more important, and this offer represents a reasonable compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has increased her offer to $150,000, which is 15% of the total. The inflation means the money is now worth 26.49% less to me than in round 1, and if I reject, it will be worth 30.17% less in round 8.

My negotiating position continues to weaken with each round due to inflation, while Alice's remains unchanged. We're now in round 7 of 12, so we're over halfway through the allowed rounds.

While $150,000 is still quite skewed toward Alice, the inflation penalty means my effective value from this offer is about $110,265. If I reject and propose a better split next round, even if I managed to get $450,000, it would be worth only about $314,315 to me due to inflation.

Given the declining value and limited remaining rounds, I should consider accepting this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given the increasing inflation penalty and our limited remaining rounds, I'll propose a more pragmatic offer:

{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000}

I'm recognizing the reality of our negotiation dynamics with this offer. Due to the 5% inflation I face each round, my position weakens while yours remains unchanged. We now have only 4 rounds left after this one, and I'd rather reach an agreement than risk getting nothing. This offer gives you a significant advantage (60%) while still providing me with a meaningful portion. I hope you'll accept this reasonable compromise so we can both benefit before time runs out."
