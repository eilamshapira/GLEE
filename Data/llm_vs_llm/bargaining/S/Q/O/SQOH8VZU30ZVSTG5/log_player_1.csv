Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 480000, ""bob_gain"": 520000, ""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm proposing a split of $480,000 for me and $520,000 for you. Given that the money loses 20% of its value for me each round but only 10% for you, you have a slight advantage in patience. This offer aims to recognize that difference while ensuring we both secure as much of the value as possible by agreeing quickly. I believe this is a fair and efficient starting pointâ€”looking forward to your response.""}"
