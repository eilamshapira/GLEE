"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm proposing a split of $480000 for me and $520000 for you. Given that the money loses 20% of its value for me each round but only 10% for you, you have a slight advantage in patience. This offer aims to recognize that difference while ensuring we both secure as much of the value as possible by agreeing quickly. I believe this is a fair and efficient starting pointâ€”looking forward to your response. 
# Bob gain: 520000 
# Alice gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
