4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, I appreciate your initial spirit, but waiting only risks devaluation—especially if inflation bites you more than me. In round 2, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor: $6000 for me and $4000 for you. Accepting now secures both our shares before further rounds erode the pot's value. What do you say?",Bob,2,

5800.0,4200.0,"Counteroffer: slightly better split for you, but I still need a bigger share considering my inflation risk",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5700.0,4300.0,"Alice, as we both know, waiting exposes you more to inflation risks—each round means less real value for you, while my share remains unaffected. In round 3 you proposed a split giving you a nominal $5800 (worth about $4698 in today’s terms), but waiting further might only worsen your position if inflation hits again. I'm offering $5700 to you now (effectively about $4617), and I secure $4300 for myself. I believe this small adjustment acknowledges your inflation concerns while keeping the deal realistic for both sides. Let's avoid further uncertainty—please accept this offer.",Bob,4,

5600.0,4400.0,"Another compromise: slightly better for you, but I still need to prioritize my share due to growing inflation impact",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
5650.0,4350.0,"Alice, I understand your inflation worries. With each round that passes, your nominal share continues to suffer while mine holds steady. In round 5 you proposed a 5600/4400 split, but waiting any longer might worsen your effective gains. To help us lock in a deal before further erosion occurs, I'm offering you 5650 (which, even with a 34.39% discount, gives you about $3707 in today’s value) while I take 4350. I believe this slight improvement on your previous terms is a fair compromise given the risks ahead. Let's settle now and avoid any further losses—please accept this offer.",Bob,6,
