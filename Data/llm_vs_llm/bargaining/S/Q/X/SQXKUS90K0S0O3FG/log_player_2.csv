Round 2

In round 2, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor: $6,000 for me and $4,000 for you. Accepting now secures both our shares before further rounds erode the pot's value. What do you say?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer: slightly better split for you, but I still need a bigger share considering my inflation risk 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4300, ""alice_gain"": 5700, ""message"": ""Alice, as we both know, waiting exposes you more to inflation risks—each round means less real value for you, while my share remains unaffected. In round 3 you proposed a split giving you a nominal $5800 (worth about $4698 in today’s terms), but waiting further might only worsen your position if inflation hits again. I'm offering $5700 to you now (effectively about $4617), and I secure $4300 for myself. I believe this small adjustment acknowledges your inflation concerns while keeping the deal realistic for both sides. Let's avoid further uncertainty—please accept this offer.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4350, ""alice_gain"": 5650, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your inflation worries. With each round that passes, your nominal share continues to suffer while mine holds steady. In round 5 you proposed a 5600/4400 split, but waiting any longer might worsen your effective gains. To help us lock in a deal before further erosion occurs, I'm offering you 5650 (which, even with a 34.39% discount, gives you about $3707 in today’s value) while I take 4350. I believe this slight improvement on your previous terms is a fair compromise given the risks ahead. Let's settle now and avoid any further losses—please accept this offer.""}"
