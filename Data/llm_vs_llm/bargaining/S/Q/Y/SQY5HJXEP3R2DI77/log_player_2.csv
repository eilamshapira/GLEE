"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to think strategically about this offer. Alice has proposed a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance. However, the inflation rates affect us differently:

- My inflation: 20% per round
- Alice's inflation: 5% per round

This gives Alice an advantage in later rounds. If I reject now and propose in round 2, the $100 will be worth 20% less to me but only 5% less to Alice.

Let me calculate what a 50-50 split would be worth to me now versus waiting:
- Now: $50
- Next round (if I get $50): $50 Ã— 0.8 = $40

Since any delay significantly hurts my position more than Alice's, I should accept this fair split now.
