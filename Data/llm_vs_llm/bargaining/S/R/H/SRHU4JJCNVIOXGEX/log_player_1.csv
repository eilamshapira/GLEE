"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but I believe a 55/45 split is more equitable given the risks involved. Let's agree on this and avoid further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
