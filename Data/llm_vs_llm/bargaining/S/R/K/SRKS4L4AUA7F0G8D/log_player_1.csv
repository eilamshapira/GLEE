"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since Bob has the power to accept/reject.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}

I suggest this split where I get $5,200 and Bob gets $4,800. This is a reasonable division that gives both of us a substantial amount while being close to equal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6160 
# Bob gain: 3840 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- I would get $6,160, but due to 5% inflation, it's effectively worth $5,852
- This is better than my initial proposal where I would have gotten $5,200
- Even with inflation, this offer gives me more value than my previous proposal
- There's risk in rejecting as further rounds mean more inflation for me
