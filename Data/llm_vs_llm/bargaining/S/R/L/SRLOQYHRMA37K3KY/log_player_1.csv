"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation impact on my share, I propose a 55/45 split. It's more balanced given the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering Bob's offer and the fact that the money I gain is still worth the same, while his share is devalued due to inflation, I think I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was rejected and the inflation affects his share, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself while still being reasonable.

{""alice_gain"": 650000, 
""bob_gain"": 350000, 
""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm being generous with 35%""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the significant impact of inflation on my share, now at 36% less value, I propose a 60/40 split to compensate for the loss in value over time. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation significantly devaluing Bob's share, his offer seems more reasonable now. However, considering I can still get the full value of my share, I should think carefully about accepting this offer.
