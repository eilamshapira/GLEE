"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4737 
# Alice gain: 5263 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether I should accept this offer, I need to consider the potential outcomes of rejecting it and moving to the next round, taking into account the inflation factor that affects my share.

Given that the total amount to be divided is $10,000 and Alice's offer gives me $4,737, I'll evaluate this based on the current value without inflation first.

However, since I know that with each passing round, the money is worth 10% less for me, I need to consider whether I can get a better deal in the next round, despite the inflation.

For Round 1, Alice's offer seems somewhat reasonable, but without knowing how inflation affects her, it's a bit of a gamble to accept or reject based solely on the numbers provided.

Given the information and the fact that this is the first round, I might be inclined to reject the offer to see if I can negotiate a better split in the next round, considering I don't know how Alice's perception of value changes over rounds.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer and we're moving to Round 2, I need to make a proposal. Considering the 10% inflation factor that reduces the value for me, the effective amount I'm negotiating over is now 90% of $10,000, which is $9,000.

However, since the actual division is still based on the original $10,000, I'll make my offer with that in mind, trying to balance getting a fair share with the risk of further inflation in subsequent rounds.

My strategy will be to offer Alice a bit less than she offered me, to test her willingness to negotiate and to account for the inflation factor affecting my share.

So, I'll offer Alice $5,000, and I'll take $5,000.
