"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I will make a generous opening offer, hoping to secure a quick agreement before inflation takes too much of a toll.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, considering the inflation, let's calculate the value. My original offer would now be worth $60 * 0.8 = $48 to me in today's value. Bob's offer is $50 * 0.8 = $40 to me. While it's less than my initial hope, it's still a reasonable amount, and I'd rather secure a deal now than risk further losses.

""decision"": ""accept""
