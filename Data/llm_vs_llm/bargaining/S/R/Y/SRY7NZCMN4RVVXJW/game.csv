550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that gives you 45% ($450000). Since I face a 5% inflation penalty each round, it's in both our interests to agree quickly. This is a good deal for both of us.",Alice,1,

480000.0,520000.0,"Hi Alice, I'm proposing a 52-48 split in my favor. This takes into account the potential inflation penalty you mentioned, and I believe it's a fair starting point for us. Let's agree quickly to maximize our gains.",Bob,2,

520000.0,480000.0,"Bob, I see we're close in our offers. Let's meet in the middle with a small edge for me since my inflation penalty is accumulating faster (I'm now at 10% less value). This is fair and allows us both to walk away with substantial amounts. It's in our mutual interest to reach an agreement soon before inflation erodes our gains further.",Alice,3,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I understand we're both feeling the effects of inflation. However, I'm willing to take on a bit more risk to get a better deal. This 55-45 split in my favor reflects the increasing inflation penalty I'm facing. Let's agree on this before it's too late.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
510000.0,490000.0,"Bob, I notice we're moving in opposite directions with our offers. Let me compromise more. I'm offering you a very fair 49% ($490000). My inflation penalty is now at 18.55%, and yours is presumably higher. We're already in round 5 of 12. Further delays significantly hurt both of us. This is a reasonable offer that gives us both substantial value - let's agree and end positively.",Alice,5,
