"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob that's reasonable but slightly in my favor considering the inflation penalty I face each round.

""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that gives you 45% ($450,000). Since I face a 5% inflation penalty each round, it's in both our interests to agree quickly. This is a good deal for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm proposing a 52-48 split in my favor. This takes into account the potential inflation penalty you mentioned, and I believe it's a fair starting point for us. Let's agree quickly to maximize our gains. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 520000, 
""bob_gain"": 480000, 
""message"": ""Bob, I see we're close in our offers. Let's meet in the middle with a small edge for me since my inflation penalty is accumulating faster (I'm now at 10% less value). This is fair and allows us both to walk away with substantial amounts. It's in our mutual interest to reach an agreement soon before inflation erodes our gains further.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand we're both feeling the effects of inflation. However, I'm willing to take on a bit more risk to get a better deal. This 55-45 split in my favor reflects the increasing inflation penalty I'm facing. Let's agree on this before it's too late.

# Bob gain: 550000

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 510000, 
""bob_gain"": 490000, 
""message"": ""Bob, I notice we're moving in opposite directions with our offers. Let me compromise more. I'm offering you a very fair 49% ($490,000). My inflation penalty is now at 18.55%, and yours is presumably higher. We're already in round 5 of 12. Further delays significantly hurt both of us. This is a reasonable offer that gives us both substantial value - let's agree and end positively.""}"
