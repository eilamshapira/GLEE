"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that gives you 45% ($450000). Since I face a 5% inflation penalty each round, it's in both our interests to agree quickly. This is a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since this is the first round, I don't have to worry about the inflation penalty yet. Considering Alice's offer, 45% of the total amount is a reasonable starting point. However, I'd like to see if I can get a better deal in the next round. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, now it's my turn to make a proposal. Considering the inflation penalty, I'll make a reasonable offer to Alice. 

{""bob_gain"": 520000, 
""alice_gain"": 480000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I'm proposing a 52-48 split in my favor. This takes into account the potential inflation penalty you mentioned, and I believe it's a fair starting point for us. Let's agree quickly to maximize our gains.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're close in our offers. Let's meet in the middle with a small edge for me since my inflation penalty is accumulating faster (I'm now at 10% less value). This is fair and allows us both to walk away with substantial amounts. It's in our mutual interest to reach an agreement soon before inflation erodes our gains further. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 19% less due to inflation, the actual value of Alice's offer to me is:
480000 * 0.81 (1 - 0.19) = 388800

Considering this, I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I also don't want to risk losing more value due to inflation in the next rounds. However, I think I can try to negotiate a bit more.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, now it's my turn to make a proposal again. Considering the inflation penalty, which has reduced the value of my potential gain by 19% so far, and will reduce it by another 10% this round (making it 29% less valuable than in the first round), I'll try to make a more favorable offer to myself.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I understand we're both feeling the effects of inflation. However, I'm willing to take on a bit more risk to get a better deal. This 55-45 split in my favor reflects the increasing inflation penalty I'm facing. Let's agree on this before it's too late.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I notice we're moving in opposite directions with our offers. Let me compromise more. I'm offering you a very fair 49% ($490000). My inflation penalty is now at 18.55%, and yours is presumably higher. We're already in round 5 of 12. Further delays significantly hurt both of us. This is a reasonable offer that gives us both substantial value - let's agree and end positively. 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 34.39% less due to inflation, the actual value of Alice's offer to me is:
490000 * 0.6561 (1 - 0.3439) = 321,489

Considering this, Alice's offer seems more reasonable, especially since she's compromising and acknowledging the effects of inflation on both of us. Given that we're already in round 5 and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me, I think it's time to accept a deal that still gives me a substantial amount.
