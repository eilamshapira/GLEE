Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. This is a fair offer considering the time pressure and devaluation.  It's time to wrap this up. 
# Alice gain: 4875 
# Bob gain: 5125 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

While this offer isn't ideal, it's better than what I might get if I continue to reject and the value depreciates further.  Bob seems determined to keep the higher share, and I'm better off taking a decent amount now than risking a worse outcome later."
