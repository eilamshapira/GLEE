"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor because I face 20% inflation per round, which significantly decreases the value of my money if we delay. If we can agree now, we both walk away with substantial value. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. This is the first round, and I'm facing 10% inflation per round
2. If I accept now, I get $40
3. If I reject and propose next round:
   - The money will be worth 10% less to me
   - I could propose a better split, but Alice might reject
   - We'd waste a round and both face inflation

While I might get a better nominal amount by rejecting, there's risk involved, and the inflation will eat into any gains. The $40 offer is reasonable enough given the circumstances.
