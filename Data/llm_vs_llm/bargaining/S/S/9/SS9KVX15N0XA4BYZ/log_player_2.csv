"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering a significant share to ensure we finish this quickly. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","I should reject this offer since it's highly unfavorable to me (only $10 out of $100). Even with the 20% inflation penalty for the next round, I can still propose a more balanced split next time.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split, acknowledging that we both lose value from delays.

{""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Let's be fair. This is a reasonable split that benefits both of us. Further delays will only reduce the value for everyone due to inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm adjusting the offer based on your previous rejection. Let's not waste any more time; this is a fair split. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- I'm offered $40, but due to 36% inflation, it's actually worth $25.60 to me
- If I reject, the next round will have a 48.8% inflation for me, making any amount even less valuable
- Alice seems to be immune to inflation, giving her a stronger negotiating position
- This is a much better offer than the initial $10, and given my weakening position due to inflation, it's better to accept now
