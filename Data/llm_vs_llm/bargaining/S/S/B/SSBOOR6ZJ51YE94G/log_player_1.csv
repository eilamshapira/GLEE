"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the impact of inflation on my gains.

Considering that my $1 from Round 1 is now worth slightly less, and Bob's offer is for $45, I'll calculate the effective value of the $45 based on the 5% inflation.

To get the equivalent value in Round 1 dollars: $45 / 1.05 = $42.86 (approximately).

Since the amount I get from Bob's offer is significantly less than my first offer, I will reject.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand. I'll make another offer, keeping in mind the inflation that affects my potential gains.

Considering the impact of inflation on my gains, here's my offer for Round 3:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to account for the cumulative inflation of 14.26% compared to Round 1. This means my money is worth 1 - 0.1426 = 0.8574 of its original value.

Bob is offering me $48. Let's calculate its equivalent value in Round 1 terms: $48 / 1.1426 = $42.01 (approximately).

Since my previous offers were better than this, I will reject.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand. I need to make a new offer, considering the ongoing inflation.

Given that my money's value continues to decrease with each round, here's my offer for Round 5:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Alright, let's analyze Bob's offer in Round 6, factoring in the cumulative inflation of 22.62%.  This means my dollar is now worth 1 - 0.2262 = 0.7738 of its original value.

Bob is offering me $50. To determine its equivalent value in Round 1 terms, we divide: $50 / 1.2262 = $40.77 (approximately).

Since my previous offers gave me a better amount of money, I'll reject.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
