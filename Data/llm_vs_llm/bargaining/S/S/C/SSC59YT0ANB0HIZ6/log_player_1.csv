"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to make a reasonable offer to Bob, keeping in mind the declining value of the money with each round. I'll start with a proposal that favors me slightly, but still gives Bob a good portion to incentivize him to accept.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob's offer is an even split. While I aimed for a better deal in the first round, the inflation makes this a more appealing offer now. I'll accept the fair split.
