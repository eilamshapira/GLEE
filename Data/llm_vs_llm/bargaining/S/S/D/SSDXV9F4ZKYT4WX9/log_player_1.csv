"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fairly equal split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because:
1. It's close enough to 50-50 to be considered fair
2. It gives me a slight advantage as the first mover
3. It leaves Bob with a substantial amount that might make them more likely to accept rather than risk future rounds"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Bob is offering a 50-50 split ($500,000 each)
2. Due to inflation, Bob's $500,000 is actually worth 10% less to them (equivalent to $450,000 in Round 1 value)
3. My $500,000 maintains its full value since inflation doesn't affect me
4. If I reject, we go to Round 3 where I can make another offer, but Bob's money will be worth even less

This is actually a good offer for me because:
- I get the same amount as Bob nominally
- In real terms, I'm getting more value than Bob due to inflation
- There's risk in rejecting and continuing to future rounds
