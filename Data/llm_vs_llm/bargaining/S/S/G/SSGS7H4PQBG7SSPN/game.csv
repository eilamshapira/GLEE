800000.0,200000.0,Let's start with a fair division. I hope we can work together.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
1.0,999999.0,"Alice, I know you value fairness, but remember that waiting costs you dearly. In round 3 you’d be forced to propose under even harsher discount—effectively leaving you almost nothing. Accept this offer now: you get $1 (worth $0.80 in today’s value) rather than a future of losses.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
640000.0,360000.0,"I understand the situation is getting tougher, but I hope we can still reach a better agreement together.",Alice,3,

0.0,1000000.0,"Alice, time is not on your side—each round further erodes your share’s value. If you reject, you move to round 5, where as the proposer you’re forced to concede the entire pie to me in equilibrium, leaving you nothing. Accept this offer now and avoid the inevitable loss.",Bob,4,

50000.0,950000.0,"This is a tough position for me, but I want to ensure you receive a substantial amount. Let's close this deal.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
1.0,999999.0,"Alice, if you reject this offer, you'll be forced to propose in round 7 where, due to the extreme discounting on your share (only about 26% of face value), you'll end up with nothing. Accepting 1 dollar now guarantees you a positive value rather than the inevitable zero. Choose wisely.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
10000.0,990000.0,"I know this isn't ideal, but given the circumstances, I hope you'll consider this offer to finalize the deal.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
20000.0,980000.0,"Alice, every round you wait further erodes your share even more. In round 9, as the proposer, you'll be forced to accept an even lower value due to inflation. By accepting 20000 now, you secure a better outcome than what the future harsh discount would grant you. Let's close this deal before it’s too late.",Bob,8,
