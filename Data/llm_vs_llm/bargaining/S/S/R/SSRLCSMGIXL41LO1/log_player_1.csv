"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a slightly favorable split for me since I'm making the first offer, but still fair enough that Bob might accept to avoid inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000. This is a reasonable split that gives both of us a substantial amount while avoiding the risk of losing value to inflation in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept, I'll get $500,000, but due to 10% inflation, it's actually worth $450,000 to me
- If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, any amount will be worth even less (20% less than original value)
- Bob's offering an equal split, which is fair in principle
- Even with the inflation effect, this is still a substantial amount
- Continuing the negotiation would likely lead to diminishing returns for both parties

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept the offer. While I'm getting less value than I could have in round 1, it's better to secure this amount now than risk further devaluation in subsequent rounds."
