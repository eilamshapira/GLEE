550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I'm proposing that I get $550000 and you get $450000. Since you face 5% inflation per round while I don't, accepting now means you get the full value of your share. If we go to the next round, your $450000 would only be worth $427500 to you in present value terms, so this is a fair offer that maximizes our combined utility.",Alice,1,

500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, I rejected your offer because it was not equitable given the inflation I face. My proposal is a 50-50 split, which is fair considering the diminishing value of money for me each round. If you accept now, we both get the maximum value from the current pot. Let's end this on a fair note.",Bob,2,
