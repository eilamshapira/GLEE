"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob considering the inflation impacts on his valuation of the money.

{""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm proposing that I get $550,000 and you get $450,000. Since you face 5% inflation per round while I don't, accepting now means you get the full value of your share. If we go to the next round, your $450,000 would only be worth $427,500 to you in present value terms, so this is a fair offer that maximizes our combined utility.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I rejected your offer because it was not equitable given the inflation I face. My proposal is a 50-50 split, which is fair considering the diminishing value of money for me each round. If you accept now, we both get the maximum value from the current pot. Let's end this on a fair note. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
