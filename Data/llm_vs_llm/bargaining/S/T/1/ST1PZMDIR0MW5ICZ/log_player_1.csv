"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer for the division of $10,000 in Round 1. Given the different inflation rates (5% for me, 20% for Bob), I should consider these dynamics in my proposal.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose we split the money equally - $5,000 for each of us. This is a fair division that gives us both the same amount, and avoids the value loss from delaying."
