"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice has proposed a 40/60 split in her favor. While I'd prefer a more equal split, I need to consider the inflation effect. If I reject, I'll lose 5% of the money's value, while Alice loses 10%. 

Let me think about this: If I reject and propose a better split for me next round, Alice might reject it due to the 10% inflation penalty she faces, leading to further rounds with even more value lost. 

However, I think I can make a better offer in the next round that accounts for inflation and might be more acceptable to both of us.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll offer a split that accounts for inflation and tries to balance our interests.

Since Alice faces a 10% inflation penalty per round, she would prefer to reach an agreement sooner. I'll offer a slightly better deal than her original proposal, but still advantageous to me.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I propose an even 50/50 split of the $100. This is fair and gives Alice a better outcome than if we continued to further rounds with increasing inflation penalties. For both of us, reaching an agreement now is better than continuing with diminishing returns."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer carefully considering the inflation effects.

Alice has improved her offer from the initial 40/60 split to a 45/55 split. Due to inflation, the $45 I would receive is worth 9.75% less than in round 1, making it equivalent to about $40.61 of round 1 value.

If I reject and we go to round 4, I'll face even more inflation (around 14.75% from round 1), and Alice would face 29% inflation from round 1. This significantly reduces the value for both of us.

Since Alice has moved toward a more balanced split and further delays would erode our gains, accepting now seems reasonable.
