"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer to divide the $1,000,000 with Bob. Since there's inflation affecting Bob's valuation (the money is worth 10% less to him each round), I'll take this into account.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering Bob $450,000 while I take $550,000. This is a fair division considering that if Bob rejects and we move to the next round, the total value will be worth less to him due to the 10% inflation on his side. By accepting now, he gets immediate value without depreciation."
