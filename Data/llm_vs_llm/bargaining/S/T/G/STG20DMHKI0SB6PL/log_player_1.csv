"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid risk""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I take a bit more here, but let's settled it before inflation eats our money! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same, but Bob's offer gives him more, and considering the inflation effect on Bob's gain, I'll think about the potential future offers.

My response for Round 2 is:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer in Round 2 gave him more, and I rejected it, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself in Round 3, considering the inflation effect on Bob's gain.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48,
  ""message"": ""My turn to take a bit more, let's settle before inflation hurts you more""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is eating more of my share each round, let's settle this! 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is becoming more skewed in his favor, but the inflation effect on his gain is increasing. Considering this, I'll think about the potential future offers and the fact that the money I gain is still worth the same.

My response for Round 4 is:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer in Round 4 was rejected, and the inflation effect on his gain is increasing, I'll try to make a more reasonable offer that takes into account the decreasing value of Bob's share.

Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 48,
  ""bob_gain"": 52,
  ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, inflation is hurting your share more each round""
}
```"
