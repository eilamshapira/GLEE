"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer would give me $300,000 while Alice gets $700,000. This is not an equal split, and I have the ability to make a counter-offer in the next round. However, I need to consider inflation - each round makes the money worth 5% less to me, so delaying has a real cost.

If I reject and move to round 2, the total value to me would be reduced by 5%. But I could propose a more favorable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split while accounting for the 5% inflation penalty I've just incurred.

{""bob_gain"": 510000, ""alice_gain"": 490000}

I'm proposing a slightly higher amount for myself to account for the fact that I've already lost 5% of the value due to inflation. This is a fair offer that gives Alice nearly half while compensating me for the time cost I've experienced."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Alice has increased her offer to me from $300,000 to $400,000, which is an improvement. However, I need to consider the inflation effect:

Due to 9.75% inflation, $400,000 is now worth about $361,000 to me in terms of original value.

If I reject and make a counter-offer, I'll face additional 5% inflation (totaling nearly 15% loss), which significantly reduces the value of any future agreement. The inflation penalty is growing with each round, giving Alice a stronger negotiating position.

While the split still favors Alice, the inflation penalty makes accepting now more reasonable than continuing negotiations.
