"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the 5% decrease in value for me in each round, and that this is the second decrease, the total value decrease for me is 10% (1 - 0.95^2). 
However, I'll make an offer that still tries to be fair, but also takes into account the decreasing value for me.
