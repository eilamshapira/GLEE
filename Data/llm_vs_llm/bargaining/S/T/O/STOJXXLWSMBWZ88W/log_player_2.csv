"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we both get a good share before inflation affects us too much. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

1. The offer is a 50-50 split, which appears fair at first glance
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer, but:
   - The money will be worth 20% less to me in the next round
   - 80% of $5000 = $4000, so I'd need to get significantly more than $5000 to make up for the inflation
3. There's no guarantee Alice would accept a higher offer
4. We have a limited number of rounds before we both get nothing

Given these factors, this is actually a very reasonable first offer. Getting $5000 now is better than risking a lower effective amount due to inflation or total loss if we can't agree.
