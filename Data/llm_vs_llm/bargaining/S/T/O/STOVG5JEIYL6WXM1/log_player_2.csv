"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully, taking into account the 5% inflation penalty for each round if I reject.

Alice has offered me $40 out of $100, keeping $60 for herself. If I reject and propose in the next round, the total value will be worth 5% less to me (effectively $95 total value from my perspective).

If I reject, I could propose a more favorable split in the next round, but Alice might also reject my offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation for me.

Given that $40 is a substantial portion and avoiding inflation is valuable, I'll make my decision.
