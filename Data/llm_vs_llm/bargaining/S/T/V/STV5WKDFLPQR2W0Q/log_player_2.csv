"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split it reasonably. This offer considers a slight advantage for me but still gives you a substantial amount. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer sounds somewhat reasonable, I'm starting as Bob and thus have the disadvantage of inflation. Waiting even one round significantly devalues the money.  I need to push for a more advantageous split quickly to counter the inflation effect on my potential gains."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but inflation is a serious factor. This offer ensures we both get a substantial amount now.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm offering a slightly advantageous split in my favor. This is to counter the inflation and still offers Alice a good deal. Waiting longer will only hurt us both."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the impact of inflation. Let's meet in the middle and split it more evenly this time. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** Alice has come closer to an even split, and while I'd prefer my previous offer, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. Accepting now secures a reasonable amount, even with the inflation already incurred.  The risk of further devaluation outweighs the potential for a slightly better deal in future rounds."
