"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly down the middle. What do you say, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $5,000 for me
2. If I reject and wait for next round:
   - The money will be worth 20% less due to inflation
   - Maximum I could propose would be worth $4,000 to me
   - Even if I asked for all $10,000, it would only be worth $8,000 to me
   - And Alice might reject anyway

A 50-50 split is fair, and with inflation making future rounds less valuable, it's better to accept now rather than risk getting less in future rounds.
