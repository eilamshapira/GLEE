,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your proposal, but I believe we can reach a better agreement if we continue. I’m not convinced by the current split given the circumstances, so I’m opting to reject this offer.",Alice,2,reject
33.0,67.0,"Hi Bob,

I know the inflation is eating into your share as rounds pass. In round 3, if we don’t agree, you’ll be making the proposal in round 4 with even harsher inflation on your portion. To avoid that risk, I’m offering you $67, which at this round’s rate will effectively be worth about $40.2 to you (given the 40% devaluation compared to round 1), while I keep $33 which retains full value. I believe this deal protects both our interests given the upcoming penalties. Let’s settle this round and close the game!",Alice,3,
