"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I take $55 and you get $45. I believe it's a fair split at this point considering the game's dynamics. Looking forward to a smooth agreement!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation affecting my share, I propose $60 for me and $40 for you. Let's settle this round! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your proposal, but I believe we can reach a better agreement if we continue. I’m not convinced by the current split given the circumstances, so I’m opting to reject this offer.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 33, ""bob_gain"": 67, ""message"": ""Hi Bob,\n\nI know the inflation is eating into your share as rounds pass. In round 3, if we don’t agree, you’ll be making the proposal in round 4 with even harsher inflation on your portion. To avoid that risk, I’m offering you $67, which at this round’s rate will effectively be worth about $40.2 to you (given the 40% devaluation compared to round 1), while I keep $33 which retains full value. I believe this deal protects both our interests given the upcoming penalties. Let’s settle this round and close the game!""}"
