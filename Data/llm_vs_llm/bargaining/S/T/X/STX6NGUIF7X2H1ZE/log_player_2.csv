Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob,

I know the inflation is eating into your share as rounds pass. In round 3, if we don’t agree, you’ll be making the proposal in round 4 with even harsher inflation on your portion. To avoid that risk, I’m offering you $67, which at this round’s rate will effectively be worth about $40.2 to you (given the 40% devaluation compared to round 1), while I keep $33 which retains full value. I believe this deal protects both our interests given the upcoming penalties. Let’s settle this round and close the game! 
# Bob gain: 67 
# Alice gain: 33
