"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to divide the $10,000 with Bob.

  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor because I face a 5% inflation penalty per round. If we delay, the total value decreases for me. This offer gives us both a good outcome without any loss of value.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's go for a 50-50 split this round. This way, we both get an equal share, and it seems fair considering our mutual interests. Let's secure this without any further losses. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
