"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take $600000 and you take $400000. This is a fair split considering the inflation affects you more than me. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll have to think carefully about my decision.

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, the $400,000 I would receive is actually worth $320,000 to me.

I don't think this is a fair split, especially since Bob gets to keep the full value of his share.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each round, I need to act quickly to get a fair share.

In Round 2, the money was worth 80% of its original value to me. Now, in Round 3, it's worth 64% of its original value (80% * 80%).

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, considering the inflation affects me more with each round.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take $700000 and you take $300000. The inflation rate is working against Alice, and this is a reasonable split. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection from Bob.

Now, in Round 4, the money I gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, which means I'll only get about 51.2% of its original value.

If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $300,000, but its value to me will be approximately $153,600 (300,000 * 0.512).

I still don't think this is a fair split, and I'm willing to take the risk to try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob rejected my previous offer and I rejected his, it's time for me to make another proposal.

Considering the inflation, the money is now worth approximately 51.2% * 80% = 40.96% of its original value to me in this round, and it will continue to decrease.

Here's my offer for Round 5:

{""alice_gain"": 580000, 
""bob_gain"": 420000, 
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Bob. The inflation is heavily affecting my share, and I need a fair split to make this work.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take $800000 and you take $200000. The inflation is significantly reducing Alice's share each round, so this offer is reasonable under the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection from Bob, and now the inflation is really starting to bite.

In Round 6, the money I gain is worth approximately 32.77% of its original value (100% - 67.23%).

If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $200,000, but its value to me will be approximately $65,540 (200,000 * 0.3277).

I'm starting to feel the pressure, but I still think I can get a better deal. Bob's offer is quite aggressive, and I'm not willing to give up yet.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob rejected my previous offer and I rejected his, it's time for me to make another proposal.

Considering the inflation, the money is now worth approximately 32.77% * 80% = 26.22% of its original value to me in this round, and it will continue to decrease rapidly.

Here's my offer for Round 7:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation is crippling my share, and I need a significant portion to make this deal worthwhile. This is my final reasonable offer.""}"
