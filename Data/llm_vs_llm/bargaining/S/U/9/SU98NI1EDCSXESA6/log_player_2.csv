"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. Alice is proposing that I get $40 and she gets $60 out of the $100 total.

I need to consider the inflation factor. For me, there's no inflation (0%), so $40 is still worth $40 if we go to the next round. For Alice, there's 5% inflation per round, so her money will be worth less if we delay.

If I reject this offer, I'll get to make a counter-offer in the next round. Since Alice faces inflation, she has an incentive to accept a reasonable offer now rather than waiting.

$40 is less than half of the total amount. Given that I have a slight advantage due to the inflation asymmetry, I believe I can propose a more favorable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll now make a counter-offer that takes into account our different inflation rates.

Given that Alice faces 5% inflation per round and I don't, she has more incentive to reach an agreement sooner. This gives me some negotiating leverage. However, I don't want to be too aggressive and risk having my offer rejected.

I'll propose a more balanced split that's still advantageous to me:

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's counter-offer. She's now offering me $45 while taking $55 for herself.

I need to consider:
1. This is better than her initial offer of $40 for me and $60 for her
2. Alice is now facing 9.75% inflation (compounded over two rounds)
3. If I reject, I can make another offer, but Alice's inflation will continue to increase
4. If I reject and Alice rejects my next offer, we'll be in round 5 with even more inflation for Alice

Alice has moved from her initial position, which shows she's negotiating. The $45/$55 split is reasonably fair, though still slightly in her favor. However, given the inflation pressure on her side, I have some leverage to potentially get a better deal.

On the other hand, if I reject and we continue negotiating, there's a risk of ending up with no deal if negotiations break down.

Weighing these factors, I'll accept this offer as it represents a reasonable compromise.
