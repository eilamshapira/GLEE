"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a slightly favorable split for myself since I'm making the first offer, but still fair enough that Bob might accept to avoid inflation affecting the total amount.

{""alice_gain"": 5400, ""bob_gain"": 4600}

I propose that I get $5,400 and Bob gets $4,600. This is a reasonable split that gives me a small advantage while still offering Bob a substantial portion. If Bob rejects this, we'll both lose value due to the 5% inflation in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept, I get $4800, but with 5% inflation, it's worth $4560 to me
- If I reject, we go to next round where:
  - I can make a new offer
  - But my money will be worth another 5% less (10% total from original)
  - Bob's money will be worth 40% less from original

Since the current offer gives me a decent amount ($4560 in real value) and rejecting would mean further value loss for both of us, I'll accept.
