"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make this simple. I propose 80% for me and 20% for you. What do you think?

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. This way we both benefit equally from the deal.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a split of 60% for me and 40% for you. It's better than the last offer, and we can finalize this deal! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. Alice's $6000 is actually worth $3840 to her due to the 36% inflation, while my $4000 maintains its full value. This is actually a better deal for me than a 50-50 split would be at this point, considering the inflation effect on her portion.
