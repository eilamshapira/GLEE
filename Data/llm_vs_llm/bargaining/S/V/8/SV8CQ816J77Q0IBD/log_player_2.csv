"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise.  This offer reflects the value decrease and provides a more balanced split. I'm ready to negotiate further if you're open to it. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""I see your point, but we need to account for the continuous devaluation. This offer is still fair but favors you less than my previous one.""}

Let's calculate how much money we are actually negotiating about after 4 rounds of inflation:

* The money is worth 5% less each round.
* After the first round, the money is worth 95% of its original value.
* After the second round, the money is worth 90.25% of its original value.
* After the third round, the money is worth 85.74% of its original value.
* After the fourth round, the money is worth 81.45% of its original value.

So, the $10,000 is now worth $8,145.

My offer in real value is:

* Bob gain: $4,236
* Alice gain: $3,909"
