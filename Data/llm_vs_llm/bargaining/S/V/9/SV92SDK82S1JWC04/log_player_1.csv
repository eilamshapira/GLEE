"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 555556, ""bob_gain"": 444444, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $555,556 and you receive $444,444. This division reflects our future bargaining leverage when accounting for the 20% devaluation each round. If you decline, the available amount next round drops to 800K, reducing both of our stakes. Accepting now ensures we both maximize our returns.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the 20% devaluation, my proposal is for me to receive $550000 and you to receive $450000. This offer takes into account the reduced value of the money in the next round and aims to balance our gains more equitably. Let's settle now to maximize what we can get before it devalues further. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the proposal. Given that accepting now gives me $450,000 at the current value, itâ€™s a better deal than waiting for the next round where further devaluation would leave me with less. I accept your offer.""}"
