"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $555556 and you receive $444444. This division reflects our future bargaining leverage when accounting for the 20% devaluation each round. If you decline, the available amount next round drops to 800K, reducing both of our stakes. Accepting now ensures we both maximize our returns. 
# Bob gain: 444444 
# Alice gain: 555556 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
