450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. Since you face 10% inflation per round and I don't, this is actually better for you than waiting another round. If we go to round 3, your share would be worth even less to you due to inflation. This is a fair compromise considering the game mechanics.",Bob,2,

400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Consider the inflation effect: your $400000 is worth about $284000 to you now (29% inflation), but if we go another round, your share will be worth even less due to 39% total inflation. Since I don't face inflation, I can wait longer without penalty. This offer is your best option considering the game mechanics.",Bob,4,
