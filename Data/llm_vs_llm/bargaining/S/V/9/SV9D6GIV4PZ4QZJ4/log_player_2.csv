"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. Alice is proposing that she gets $600,000 (60%) and I get $400,000 (40%). This doesn't seem like a fair split to me, especially considering that she faces a 10% inflation penalty per round while I don't face any inflation.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, Alice's money will be worth 10% less to her. This gives me some negotiating leverage, as her $600,000 would effectively be worth $540,000 to her in the next round.

I believe I can get a better deal by rejecting this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that takes into account the inflation factor that affects Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. Since you face 10% inflation per round and I don't, this is actually better for you than waiting another round. If we go to round 3, your share would be worth even less to you due to inflation. This is a fair compromise considering the game mechanics.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is my best offer yet. I'm willing to compromise, but I still want a larger share. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this new offer from Alice. She's now offering me $420,000 and keeping $580,000 for herself.

Alice's money is now worth 19% less to her due to inflation. So her $580,000 is effectively worth only $469,800 to her at this point.

This is only a slight improvement from her first offer (where she offered me $400,000). Given that I don't face any inflation penalty and can continue to negotiate without my money losing value, I think I can get a better deal by rejecting this offer.

If we go to round 4, Alice's money will be worth even less to her (29% less than the first round), which gives me more leverage.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Consider the inflation effect: your $400,000 is worth about $284,000 to you now (29% inflation), but if we go another round, your share will be worth even less due to 39% total inflation. Since I don't face inflation, I can wait longer without penalty. This offer is your best option considering the game mechanics.""}"
