Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for round 2, taking into account the inflation for me:

```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split. This gives me a larger share to compensate for the potential inflation in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for round 4, considering the increasing inflation for me:

```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000

I'm proposing a 70/30 split. I need a bigger share now to offset the inflation."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for round 6, seriously considering the massive inflation hitting me:

```json
{
""bob_gain"": 750000,
""alice_gain"": 250000
}
```

I'm asking for 75%, hoping to get a decent value after the inflation hits. It's a risk, but the alternative is getting almost nothing."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, this is getting desperate. Inflation is killing me. Here's my (probably unreasonable) offer for round 8:

```json
{
""bob_gain"": 800000,
""alice_gain"": 200000
}
```

I need 80% to even have a chance of making this worthwhile at this point. It's a huge ask, but the inflation is crushing me."
