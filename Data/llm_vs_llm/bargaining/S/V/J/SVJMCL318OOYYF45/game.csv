6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm offering you $4000 while I take $6000. This is actually a fair deal considering that with each round that passes, the money loses 10% value for you but maintains its value for me. If we go to another round, the total value for you drops, so this is optimal for both of us.",Alice,1,

5500.0,4500.0,"Alice, I understand your point, but considering the inflation affecting me, I think a split of $4500 for me and $5500 for you is more fair. This way, we both get a reasonable share, and I can mitigate the loss from inflation.",Bob,2,
