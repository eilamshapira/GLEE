"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make my first offer to Bob, considering the unique inflation aspect of this game.

{""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you $4,000 while I take $6,000. This is actually a fair deal considering that with each round that passes, the money loses 10% value for you but maintains its value for me. If we go to another round, the total value for you drops, so this is optimal for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your point, but considering the inflation affecting me, I think a split of $4500 for me and $5500 for you is more fair. This way, we both get a reasonable share, and I can mitigate the loss from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
