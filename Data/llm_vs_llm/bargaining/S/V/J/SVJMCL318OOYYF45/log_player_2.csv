"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you $4000 while I take $6000. This is actually a fair deal considering that with each round that passes, the money loses 10% value for you but maintains its value for me. If we go to another round, the total value for you drops, so this is optimal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your point, but considering the inflation affecting me, I think a split of $4500 for me and $5500 for you is more fair. This way, we both get a reasonable share, and I can mitigate the loss from inflation.""}"
