"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
- Alice is proposing a 50-50 split ($500,000 each)
- If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
- However, due to 10% inflation, the $500,000 would only be worth $450,000 to me in the next round
- Even if I try to negotiate for more in the next round, I'd need to get significantly more to make up for the inflation loss
- A 50-50 split is generally considered fair
- There's risk in rejecting as Alice might make worse offers later

Given these factors, especially the inflation penalty, I should accept this fair offer now rather than risk getting less value later.
