"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 850000, ""alice_gain"": 150000}

I'm offering you $150,000 while I take $850,000. Since the money is worth 20% less to you each round, if you reject this offer, in the next round the entire $1 million will only be worth $800,000 to you. This means my offer of $150,000 now is actually better than getting even $180,000 in the next round. This is a fair offer given the inflation constraints."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000
