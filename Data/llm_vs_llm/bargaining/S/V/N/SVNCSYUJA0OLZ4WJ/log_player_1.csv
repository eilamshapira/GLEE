"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a fair offer that accounts for the inflation rates. Since both our returns decline with each round, it's beneficial to reach an agreement sooner rather than later.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""I'm offering an equal split of $5000 each. This is fair, and since inflation affects us both (you at 10% and me at 20% per round), we both benefit from accepting early. Looking forward to a quick resolution!""
