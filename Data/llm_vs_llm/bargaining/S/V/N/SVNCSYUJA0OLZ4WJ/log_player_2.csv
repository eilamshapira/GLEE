"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering an equal split of $5000 each. This is fair, and since inflation affects us both (you at 10% and me at 20% per round), we both benefit from accepting early. Looking forward to a quick resolution! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer is a 50-50 split, which appears fair at first glance.
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but:
   - The total value will be worth 10% less to me
   - It will be worth 20% less to Alice
   - This means Alice will be more likely to accept a less favorable offer in later rounds
3. However, $5000 right now is a solid offer, and trying to negotiate for more carries risk.

Given that this is a fair initial offer and there's risk in prolonging negotiations, I'll accept.
