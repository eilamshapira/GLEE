"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. Alice is proposing I get $4,500 and she gets $5,500 out of the $10,000. If I reject and move to the next round, the money will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation, which means the total value to me would be $9,500 instead of $10,000. 

If I make a counter-offer in the next round, the maximum value I could get would be $9,500 (if I somehow managed to get all of it). So if I reject, my $4,500 would be worth at most $4,275 in the next round (95% of its current value).

Since $4,500 now is better than a potential but uncertain higher amount that would be devalued in the next round, I should accept this offer.
