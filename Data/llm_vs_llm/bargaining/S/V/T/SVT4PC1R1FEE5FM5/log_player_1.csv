Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I think a 50-50 split is fair for both of us. This gives us equal shares and avoids further inflation which would reduce the total value for at least me. Let's settle this fairly and quickly. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
