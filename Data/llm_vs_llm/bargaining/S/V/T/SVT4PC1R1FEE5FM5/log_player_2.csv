"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. 60/40 split seems reasonable for the first round. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider my options carefully. Alice is offering me 4000 out of 10000, which is 40%. This might seem a bit low, but I need to factor in the inflation effect of 20% per round. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value will be worth less to me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counter-offer considering the inflation effect.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I think a 50-50 split is fair for both of us. This gives us equal shares and avoids further inflation which would reduce the total value for at least me. Let's settle this fairly and quickly.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the 50/50 sentiment, but we both know time is on my side with this inflation. I'm willing to be generous, but this offer won't last forever. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is now offering me 4200 out of 10000, which is 42%. She's increased her offer slightly from the initial 40%. 

However, there's a key piece of information here: my inflation rate (36% by round 3) is much higher than Alice's (only 9.75%). This significant difference means the money loses value much faster for me than for Alice with each passing round.

Given this asymmetric inflation pressure, and the fact that Alice has improved her offer slightly, I should accept this offer rather than risk further devaluation of my share.
