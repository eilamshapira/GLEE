"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me make a strategic first offer. Since I know we both face inflation penalties (mine being higher at 10% per round), it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. I'll propose a slightly favorable split for myself but still attractive enough for Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this 60-40 split because:
1. As Alice, I face higher inflation (10% vs 5%), so I need a better initial position
2. It's fair enough that Bob might accept it to avoid inflation losses
3. If Bob rejects, they'll have to make a counter-offer with both our money worth less"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept now:
   * I get $450,000 × 0.9 = $405,000 (after 10% inflation)
   * Bob gets $550,000 × 0.95 = $522,500 (after 5% inflation)

2. If I reject:
   * Next round will have even higher inflation
   * I could propose again, but my money would be worth 20% less
   * Bob's money would be worth 10% less
   * I might end up with less if negotiations continue

Given that:
- The offer is reasonable
- My inflation penalty is higher (10% vs 5%)
- Further delays will hurt me more than Bob
- There's risk in continued negotiation
