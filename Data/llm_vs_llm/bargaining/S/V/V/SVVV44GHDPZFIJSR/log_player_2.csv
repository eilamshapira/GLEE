"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly. I'm offering you a good deal in the first round! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice's offer seems ""fair"" on the surface, but the impact of inflation is significant. It's in my best interest to hold out for a better deal in the later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice. This time, I get the better half. The clock is ticking.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob. Let's try a true 50/50 split this time. It's the fairest option, and we don't want to end up with nothing, do we? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

While a 50/50 split sounds fair, Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation more than I am.  I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice. This is a good deal considering the inflation. Take it while you can!""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, it's getting late. Let's try this. I'm offering a slightly less favorable split for me, but it's still something. Think about what you're giving up with each passing round. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is getting desperate, but I can still push for a better deal. 5500 is better than nothing, but I'm willing to bet I can get closer to 7000 if I hold out a bit longer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. Take it or leave it. It's better than risking getting nothing in the later rounds!""}"

Round 7

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to feel the pinch. How about this? It's a reasonable split, and avoids us getting nothing. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is the same offer Alice gave me in round 1, but the tables have turned.  Due to inflation, this is a much better deal for me now than it was for her then. I'm accepting before she changes her mind!"
