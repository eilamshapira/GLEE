Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's split it 55-45. A fairer distribution, considering the diminishing value of the money with each round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Bob, since we're now in round 3 and the money's value has decreased further, I suggest we go with 55-45 in my favor. It's a compromise from my initial offer and takes into account the inflation. Let's settle this round.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is round 4, and the money is losing value fast. Let's be reasonable and split it 52-48. This gives me a slight edge to compensate for potentially rejecting future offers, and it's still a good deal for both of us considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52
