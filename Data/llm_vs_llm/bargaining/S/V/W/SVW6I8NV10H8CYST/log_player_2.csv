Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, since we're now in round 3 and the money's value has decreased further, I suggest we go with 55-45 in my favor. It's a compromise from my initial offer and takes into account the inflation. Let's settle this round. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 52,
  ""alice_gain"": 48,
  ""message"": ""Alice, this is round 4, and the money is losing value fast. Let's be reasonable and split it 52-48. This gives me a slight edge to compensate for potentially rejecting future offers, and it's still a good deal for both of us considering the inflation.""
