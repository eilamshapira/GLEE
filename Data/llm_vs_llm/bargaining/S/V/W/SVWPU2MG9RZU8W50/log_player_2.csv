"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
* Alice is offering me $4000 out of $10000 (40%)
* If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the money will be worth 5% less to me
* $4000 now is better than $4200 next round (which would only be worth $3990 to me due to inflation)
* While I could try to negotiate for more, there's risk in rejection due to the inflation penalty
