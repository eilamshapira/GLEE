"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $400,000 while she gets $600,000 of the $1,000,000 total.

Since there's no inflation for me (0% less each round), I don't lose value by rejecting and making a counter-offer. However, I don't know how inflation affects Alice, which is interesting - she might be under pressure to accept earlier offers.

This is round 1 of 12 possible rounds, so I have plenty of opportunities to negotiate for a better deal. While $400,000 is substantial, I believe I can secure more by making a counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more favorable to me while still being reasonable enough that Alice might accept it.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I propose this more balanced division where I receive $550,000 and Alice receives $450,000. Since we both need to agree on a division, and I believe we should both get significant portions of the money, this division gives me a majority while still offering Alice a substantial amount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice has improved her offer from round 1, now proposing I get $450,000 instead of $400,000. I also see that inflation is affecting Alice - her gains are now worth 9.75% less than in round 1, while my gains maintain their value.

This inflation information is important. It means Alice has more incentive to reach an agreement sooner rather than later, as the value of her share decreases with time. However, since we're only in round 3 of 12, and my money doesn't lose value, I still have room to negotiate for a better deal.

Alice's new offer is better, but I think I can still get closer to an even split by negotiating further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that Alice is facing inflation (her money is worth 9.75% less in round 3 than round 1), while my money maintains its value, I'll propose an offer that's slightly better for me than Alice's last offer, but not as aggressive as my previous proposal.

{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000}

I propose this division where I receive $520,000 and Alice receives $480,000. This offer is more balanced than my previous one and acknowledges Alice's improved offer. Since Alice faces inflation pressure while I don't, this division should become increasingly appealing to her as the rounds progress."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting development. Despite Alice facing increasing inflation (now 18.55% less value than round 1), she's actually offering me less than before ($350,000 versus the previous $450,000) and taking more for herself.

This suggests Alice might be adopting a more aggressive strategy or thinks I'll feel pressure to accept as rounds progress. However, I need to remember:

1. I face no inflation pressure (0%)
2. We're still only in round 5 of 12
3. Alice's previous offer was significantly better than this one
4. Alice faces increasing inflation, which should logically make her more willing to settle, not less

Since this offer is worse than her previous one and I have no inflation pressure, it makes strategic sense to reject it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Alice's last offer was surprisingly less favorable to me than her previous one, despite her facing increasing inflation. This suggests either a negotiation tactic or she has different priorities than I initially assumed.

Since I face no inflation and we're only halfway through the potential rounds, I'll make an offer that's better than her last proposal but still advantageous to me. I'll aim for a more balanced split to encourage agreement.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose an equal division where we both receive $500,000. This 50-50 split is fair and reasonable as we approach the middle of our negotiation window. Given that Alice faces increasing inflation (now 18.55%), while my gains maintain their value, this equal division should be increasingly appealing to her. An even split represents a classic fair solution that might help us reach agreement."
