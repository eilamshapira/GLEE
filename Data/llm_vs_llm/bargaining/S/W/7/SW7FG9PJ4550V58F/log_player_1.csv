"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I'm ready to make my offer. Considering the inflation, I'll offer a split that favors me slightly more given the decreasing value of the money.

Here's my proposal in JSON format:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation that has affected the value of the money, I will analyze Bob's offer.

My original $60 offer is now worth 80% of its original value. Bob's original $40 offer is worth 95% of its original value.

Bob's offer to me is $40. My $60 offer, after 20% inflation, is worth $60 * 0.80 = $48 in round 2 terms. Therefore I should accept the offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
