"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering me $40 out of $100, while taking $60 for herself. This isn't an equal split, but I need to consider the inflation penalties.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value will decrease by 5% for me and 20% for Alice. That means the $100 would be worth $95 to me and only $80 to Alice in the next round.

Given these asymmetric inflation rates, I have more negotiating power by rejecting this first offer. I can propose a more favorable split next round, and Alice would have more incentive to accept since her money is devaluing faster than mine.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since we're now in round 2, I need to consider that the $100 is worth 5% less to me ($95) and 20% less to Alice ($80) compared to round 1.

Given Alice's faster devaluation rate, I'll propose a more favorable split for myself, but still reasonable enough that Alice would prefer accepting rather than moving to another round where she loses even more value.

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I'm offering you $40 and keeping $60 for myself. This is a fair proposal considering that if we go to another round, the money will continue to devalue more quickly for you than for me. At this point, $40 now is worth more to you than potentially getting a bit more in a future round after 20% inflation."
