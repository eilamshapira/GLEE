"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to make an offer to Bob, keeping in mind the inflation that affects me with each passing round. Since this is the first round, inflation isn't yet a factor. I want to be fair, but also ensure I get a good portion considering the risk of future inflation.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
