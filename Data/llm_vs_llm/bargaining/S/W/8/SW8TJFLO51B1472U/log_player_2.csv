"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $400,000 out of the $1,000,000, while she gets $600,000. 

If I reject this offer, I'll be able to make my own proposal in the next round. However, due to inflation, the money will be worth 20% less to me in the next round. This means the total value to me would be only $800,000, and my maximum possible gain would be limited by this amount.

Even if I proposed taking the entire amount in the next round, it would only be worth $800,000 to me due to inflation. Since $400,000 is 50% of $800,000, rejecting this offer wouldn't be clearly advantageous unless I'm very confident Alice would accept a proposal heavily favoring me.
