550000.0,450000.0,"Let's split it so you get $550000 and I get $450000. This way, you benefit slightly more due to your lower devaluation rate, but it's closer to an even split.",Bob,2,

580000.0,420000.0,Let's split it with me getting $580000 and you getting $420000. This takes into account the devaluation and gets us closer to a fair split.,Alice,3,

525000.0,475000.0,"Given the inflation impacts, let's agree on $475000 for me and $525000 for you. This still favors you and accounts for inflation, but it's fairer for both of us.",Bob,4,
