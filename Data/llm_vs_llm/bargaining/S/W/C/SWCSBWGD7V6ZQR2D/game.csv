2667.11,7332.89,"Hi Bob – to avoid further losses from inflation we should agree now. If you reject, you’d be the proposer in round 2 but then your share would be discounted by 5% (and our later rounds force you to settle for about what you’d get now). Thus, I’m offering you $7332.89 (which is exactly your minimum if you waited) and I keep $2667.11. Let’s wrap this up now for both our sakes!",Alice,1,
