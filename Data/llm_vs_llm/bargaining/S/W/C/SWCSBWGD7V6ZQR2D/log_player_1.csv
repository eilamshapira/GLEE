"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 2667.11, ""bob_gain"": 7332.89, ""message"": ""Hi Bob – to avoid further losses from inflation we should agree now. If you reject, you’d be the proposer in round 2 but then your share would be discounted by 5% (and our later rounds force you to settle for about what you’d get now). Thus, I’m offering you $7,332.89 (which is exactly your minimum if you waited) and I keep $2,667.11. Let’s wrap this up now for both our sakes!""}"
