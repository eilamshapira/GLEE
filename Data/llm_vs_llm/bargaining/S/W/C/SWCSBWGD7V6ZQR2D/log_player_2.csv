"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob – to avoid further losses from inflation we should agree now. If you reject, you’d be the proposer in round 2 but then your share would be discounted by 5% (and our later rounds force you to settle for about what you’d get now). Thus, I’m offering you $7332.89 (which is exactly your minimum if you waited) and I keep $2667.11. Let’s wrap this up now for both our sakes! 
# Bob gain: 7332.89 
# Alice gain: 2667.11 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
