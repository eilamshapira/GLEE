"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split the money! I'm offering you $45. This is a fair offer, and we should take it before inflation eats away at our gains. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully given the 5% inflation penalty per round. She's offering me $45 out of $100, while keeping $55 for herself.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value will be worth 5% less to me. So the total pot would effectively be worth $95 to me, and I'd need to offer Alice enough to make her accept.

While Alice's offer isn't an even split, accepting now guarantees me $45. If I reject, I'd have to propose a better split of a smaller pie (from my perspective), and Alice might still reject.

Given the inflation penalty and uncertainty about how inflation affects Alice, I'll accept this offer.
