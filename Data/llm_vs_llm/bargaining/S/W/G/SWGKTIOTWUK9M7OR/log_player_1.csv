"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'm playing as Alice in this game to divide $100 with Bob. Since I'm going first and there's a 20% inflation penalty per round for me, I should propose a fair offer that Bob would likely accept immediately.

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob! Since we both lose value if we delay (with inflation affecting me at 20% per round), I'm proposing a fair split that slightly favors me as the first mover. This way we can both walk away with a good amount without dragging this out.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this evenly.  We both lose money with each round, and this way we can each walk away with a fair share. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
