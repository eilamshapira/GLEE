"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Since we both lose value if we delay (with inflation affecting me at 20% per round), I'm proposing a fair split that slightly favors me as the first mover. This way we can both walk away with a good amount without dragging this out. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
