Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my previous offer was more generous than necessary considering my losses from inflation. I propose 5500 for me and 4500 for you. Take it or leave it - I'm losing value with each round. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Alright Bob, let's get this done. Half for me, half for you. This is my final offer. If you reject, we both lose out. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a good time to accept.  While I could push for a slightly better deal in the next round, there's no guarantee Alice will offer anything better than an even split again. It's better to take the sure thing now than risk losing everything."
