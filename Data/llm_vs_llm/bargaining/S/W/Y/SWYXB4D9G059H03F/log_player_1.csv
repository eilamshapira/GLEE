"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to make a proposal that Bob will accept, considering the decreasing value of the money in each round. To maximize my potential gain, I will start with a slightly more aggressive offer, anticipating Bob's potential reluctance and the value decay.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the inflation.

*   My round 1 value: 100%
*   My round 2 value: 90%
*   Bob's round 1 value: 100%
*   Bob's round 2 value: 95%

Bob is offering me $50 now. Accepting this means I get $50 * 0.9 = $45 in value compared to round 1.
If I reject and make an offer in round 3, it will be even less. Therefore, I should accept.
