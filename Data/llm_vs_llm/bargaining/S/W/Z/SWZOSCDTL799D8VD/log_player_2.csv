Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to negotiate. Let's split it 60/40. It's a more even split, and still gives you a good share. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, I need to consider the impact of inflation. Even though 400,000 is a decent chunk of money, it's worth significantly less than it was in Round 1.  I'm willing to gamble another round to see if I can secure a better deal, even with the inflation penalty."
