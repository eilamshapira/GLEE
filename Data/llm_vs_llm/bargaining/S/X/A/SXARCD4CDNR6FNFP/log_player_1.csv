"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob considering the inflation rates for both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, 
""bob_gain"": 4800, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob! Since we both lose value with each round (you at 10% and me at 5%), it's in our interest to agree quickly. I'm offering a fair split that acknowledges we both need to compromise. This gives us both a good outcome without risking further inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was a bit off. Let's be realistic. I'm proposing a more balanced split that reflects the higher risk I face with the faster devaluation. This way we both benefit from a quick resolution. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Bob, let's meet exactly in the middle with a 50-50 split. You're right that you face faster devaluation, but I also lose value with each round. This equal split is fair for both of us and allows us to resolve this quickly before inflation hurts us both even more.""}"
