"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Since we both lose value with each round (you at 10% and me at 5%), it's in our interest to agree quickly. I'm offering a fair split that acknowledges we both need to compromise. This gives us both a good outcome without risking further inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, your offer was a bit off. Let's be realistic. I'm proposing a more balanced split that reflects the higher risk I face with the faster devaluation. This way we both benefit from a quick resolution.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's meet exactly in the middle with a 50-50 split. You're right that you face faster devaluation, but I also lose value with each round. This equal split is fair for both of us and allows us to resolve this quickly before inflation hurts us both even more. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
