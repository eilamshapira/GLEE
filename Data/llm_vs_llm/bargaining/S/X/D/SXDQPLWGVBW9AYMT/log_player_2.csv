Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Alice after each round, I'll take that into account for my offer.

For me (Bob), the money is now worth $1,000,000 * 0.9 = $900,000.
For Alice, the money is now worth $1,000,000 * 0.8 = $800,000.

Considering this, I'll make a fair offer.

""alice_gain"": 500000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll calculate the actual value of the offer.

The original amount was $1,000,000. For me, it's now worth $1,000,000 * 0.9 * 0.9 = $810,000 (19% less than the original).
For Alice, it's now worth $1,000,000 * 0.8 * 0.8 = $640,000 (36% less than the original).

Alice's offer is $350,000 for me and $650,000 for her. Given the reduced value due to inflation, I'll evaluate the offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth even less now, I'll make a new offer.

For me (Bob), the money is now worth $1,000,000 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = $729,000.
For Alice, the money is now worth $1,000,000 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = $512,000.

Considering this, I'll make a fair offer.
