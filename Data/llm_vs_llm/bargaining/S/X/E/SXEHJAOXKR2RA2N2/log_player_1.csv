"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Let's make a fair split considering the 5% depreciation you face each round. I propose I get $60 and you get $40 - accepting now is better than waiting for the next round.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was tempting, but let's be realistic. I'm taking a risk with the inflation, so I need a bigger share to make it worthwhile. How about a 55/45 split in my favor? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this carefully:

1. Bob's offer gives me $45
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 3:
   - Bob will face another 5% depreciation
   - My money value stays the same
   - Bob might still reject my next offer, leading to more rounds

While $45 is less than my initial proposal, it's still a significant amount. If I reject and the game continues, Bob's diminishing value might make him more aggressive in future negotiations, potentially leading to a worse outcome for both of us.
