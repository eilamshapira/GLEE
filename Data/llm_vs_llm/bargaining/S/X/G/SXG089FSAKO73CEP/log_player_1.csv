"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering we both want to avoid value loss from inflation in future rounds.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor.  It's a more equitable distribution, reflecting my role in initiating the negotiation.  Let's avoid further inflation and reach a deal. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. If I accept now:
- I get $4500, but it's worth 10% less due to inflation, so effectively $4050
- Bob gets $5500

2. If I reject:
- Next round I can make another offer
- But my gains will be worth 20% less due to inflation
- I'd need to secure significantly more than $4500 to make up for the additional 10% loss

Given that Bob's offer gives me a decent share and avoiding further inflation loss is important, I should accept this offer. Getting $4050 in effective value now is better than risking a worse outcome in the next round.
