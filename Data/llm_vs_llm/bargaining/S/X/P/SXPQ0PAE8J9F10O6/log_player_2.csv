"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first move. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement within 12 rounds. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:
1. Alice is offering me 4000$
2. If I reject, next round I can make a counter-offer, but:
   - The money will be worth 5% less (3800$ value for my current 4000$ share)
   - Alice might reject my counter-offer
3. While 60-40 split favors Alice, getting a guaranteed 4000$ now might be better than risking further negotiations with diminishing value

Given the inflation penalty and uncertainty of future rounds, this is actually a reasonable first offer. If we keep negotiating, we might both end up with less due to inflation.
