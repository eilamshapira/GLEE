"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to think strategically. Since there's a 10% inflation penalty per round, I want to make a fair but advantageous first offer to avoid delays.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest we divide the $100 with me getting $55 and you getting $45. This is a reasonable split given that waiting will cost us both due to inflation. If we keep delaying, we both risk getting much less than this offer provides."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Bob is offering me less than what I offered him. Also, inflation is affecting us differently - my inflation is 10% per round while Bob's is 20% per round. This means Bob should be more motivated to reach an agreement quickly.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Now I understand the dynamics better. Since inflation affects Bob more severely (20% per round) than me (10% per round), I have some advantage if we delay. However, we both lose if we wait too long, so I should still aim for a reasonable agreement.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is fair considering the different inflation rates affecting us. If we continue delaying, both of us will lose more value, but you'll lose more quickly than I will due to your higher inflation rate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob has slightly improved his offer, but it's still not very favorable for me. Given that inflation is affecting Bob much more severely (48.8% loss for him versus 27.1% for me so far), I have the advantage in waiting. Bob should be more motivated to reach an agreement quickly.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Looking at the inflation rates, Bob is losing value much faster than I am. By round 5, my money has lost 27.1% of its value while Bob's has lost 48.8%. This gives me more leverage since waiting hurts Bob more. I'll adjust my offer slightly to be more attractive to Bob, but still maintain my advantage.

{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}

I propose a 65/35 split. Consider that your inflation rate is much higher than mine, so delaying further rounds will cost you significantly more. This offer gives you $35 now, which is better than a potentially higher nominal amount that would be worth much less to you in later rounds due to the 20% inflation you face per round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is now offering me 45%, which is a substantial improvement over his previous offers. However, I need to consider the inflation effects carefully. My money has lost 40.95% of its value while Bob's has lost 67.23%. The differential inflation continues to give me a strategic advantage.

Given that we're in round 6 of 12 possible rounds, and Bob is facing much steeper inflation, his $55 is only worth about 33% of the original value to him. If we continue to later rounds, Bob's position will worsen significantly.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","We're now more than halfway through our possible rounds, and the inflation effects are becoming quite significant. My money has lost 40.95% of its value, while Bob's has lost 67.23%. The differential inflation continues to strengthen my position, as further delays hurt Bob much more than they hurt me.

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I propose a 70/30 split. Bob, this offer makes sense for you because your inflation rate of 20% per round means your money is rapidly losing value. Your $30 now is worth more than a larger amount several rounds later. With your 67.23% inflation so far, waiting is extremely costly for you. Let's finalize this deal now to preserve value for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is continuing to improve his offers as we progress through rounds. He's now offering me 48%, which is better than before. The inflation situation is becoming extreme for Bob - his money has lost 79.03% of its value, while mine has lost 52.17%.

At this point, Bob's $52 is only worth about 11% of the original value to him. We're in round 8 of 12, and reaching the final rounds would be devastating for both of us, but especially for Bob.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","We're now in round 9 of 12, with only a few rounds remaining. The inflation effects have become extremely significant. My money has lost 52.17% of its value, while Bob's has lost 79.03%. Bob's position continues to deteriorate much faster than mine.

{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}

I propose a 75/25 split. Bob, at this point, your inflation rate of 20% per round has severely eroded your potential value. Your $25 now is worth significantly more than even a larger amount in the final rounds. With your current inflation at 79.03%, waiting longer would be catastrophic for you. We have only 3 rounds left after this one, and if we reach round 12 without agreement, we both get nothing. This offer provides you with meaningful value given our circumstances."
