"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. I need to maximize my gain, keeping in mind the inflation and the limited rounds. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

My reasoning: I'm offering Bob a seemingly fair amount (40%) in the first round. This increases the chances of him accepting and avoiding the risk of inflation and reaching the deadline. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, and all that. While I am giving up some percentage, it is likely enough to convince Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob rejected my initial offer. Now I need to consider the inflation. My potential gain is worth 20% less now. Let's calculate what that means in terms of the original $100.

Bob is offering me $45. Since this is Round 2, this is equivalent to 45 / 0.8 = $56.25 in Round 1 dollars.

Now, I need to decide if $56.25 (in original dollar value) is enough. If I reject, I risk further inflation and the possibility of getting nothing if we reach the deadline. If I accept, I secure a decent amount.

Given the risk of further inflation, I will accept Bob's offer.
