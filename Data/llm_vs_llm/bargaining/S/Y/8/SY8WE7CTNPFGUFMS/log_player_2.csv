"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 64.29 
# Alice gain: 35.71 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether I should accept this offer, I need to consider the value of the money in the current round and the potential value in future rounds, taking into account the inflation rates for both me (10% decrease per round) and Alice (20% decrease per round).

Given that the initial amount is $100 and the offer is $64.29 for me and $35.71 for Alice, I'll evaluate this based on the current round's value.

Since this is the first round, the full value of the money is still intact for both of us. The offer seems somewhat generous towards me, but I need to consider whether holding out for a potentially better offer in a future round, despite the decreasing value, could be beneficial.

However, considering the significant decrease in value for both of us per round, especially the higher decrease for Alice, it might be prudent to accept an offer that is immediately favorable rather than risking a decrease in overall value.

Therefore, my decision for Round 1 is:
