45.0,55.0,"Alice, inflation is hitting me hard. I need to secure a bit more this time. Let's settle for a 55-45 split in my favor. It's still a good deal for you, and we can both walk away with something.",Bob,4,

58.0,42.0,"Bob, let's be practical here. Your inflation rate is much higher than mine (48.8% vs 14.26%), so waiting longer hurts you more than me. A 58-42 split is fair considering this dynamic. Let's end this now before we both lose more value.",Alice,5,
