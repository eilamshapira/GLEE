"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you can still make a good profit!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it equally. This way, both of us get a fair share, and we can avoid the effects of inflation. Deal? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept now, I get $50 with 5% inflation, so effectively $47.5
2. If I reject, I can make another offer, but then my money will be worth another 5% less
3. This is only round 2, but Bob's offering an equal split which is quite reasonable
4. Bob seems to be affected more by inflation (20% vs my 5%), which means waiting longer hurts him more than me
5. However, $47.5 is still less than what I could get if Bob accepts a better offer from me in the next round

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your fair offer, but since inflation affects you more than me, I propose a 55-45 split. This is still very reasonable, and we should agree quickly before inflation reduces both our gains further.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, inflation is hitting me hard. I need to secure a bit more this time. Let's settle for a 55-45 split in my favor. It's still a good deal for you, and we can both walk away with something. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept now, I get $45 with 14.26% inflation, so effectively about $38.58
2. Bob's inflation is much higher (48.8%), making his $55 worth much less for him
3. We're already in round 4 of 12, and each round reduces our effective gains
4. Bob's asking for more despite being hit harder by inflation, which seems counterintuitive
5. I can still make another offer, but we're risking further value loss

Given that I still have leverage due to Bob's higher inflation rate, and this offer gives me less than his previous offer:

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58,
""bob_gain"": 42,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical here. Your inflation rate is much higher than mine (48.8% vs 14.26%), so waiting longer hurts you more than me. A 58-42 split is fair considering this dynamic. Let's end this now before we both lose more value.""}"
