Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your fair offer, but since inflation affects you more than me, I propose a 55-45 split. This is still very reasonable, and we should agree quickly before inflation reduces both our gains further.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical here. Your inflation rate is much higher than mine (48.8% vs 14.26%), so waiting longer hurts you more than me. A 58-42 split is fair considering this dynamic. Let's end this now before we both lose more value. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58
