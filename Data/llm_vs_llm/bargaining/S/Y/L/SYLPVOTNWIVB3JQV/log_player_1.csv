"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 3777, ""bob_gain"": 6223, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for round 1. I suggest we split the $10,000 as $3,777 for me and $6,223 for you. If you decline, the game continues but due to the 10% per round devaluation the total available money drops, and as we’ll see by backward‐induction the outcome won’t be any better for you. Accepting this offer secures you a solid share now – it’s in both our best interests to keep the pie as large as possible. What do you say?""}"
