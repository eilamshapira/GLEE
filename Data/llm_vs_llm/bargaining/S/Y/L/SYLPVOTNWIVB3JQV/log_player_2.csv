"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for round 1. I suggest we split the $10000 as $3777 for me and $6223 for you. If you decline, the game continues but due to the 10% per round devaluation the total available money drops, and as we’ll see by backward‐induction the outcome won’t be any better for you. Accepting this offer secures you a solid share now – it’s in both our best interests to keep the pie as large as possible. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 6223 
# Alice gain: 3777 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
