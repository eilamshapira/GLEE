"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. Given that we both face inflation risks with each round, accepting this fair offer now would be beneficial for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation affecting our shares, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This offer still leaves you with a significant portion while accounting for the decreasing value of money. Let's settle this round to avoid further loss in value. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 5% inflation, if I accept now, my $450,000 is worth $427,500 (450,000 * 0.95).

If I reject and we go to the next round, any amount I get will be worth another 5% less. Even if I managed to get a better split in the next round, the inflation would eat into those gains.

My original offer of $600,000 was ambitious. Bob's current offer of $450,000 (worth $427,500 to me with inflation) is reasonable, and continuing to negotiate could lead to worse outcomes due to inflation.
