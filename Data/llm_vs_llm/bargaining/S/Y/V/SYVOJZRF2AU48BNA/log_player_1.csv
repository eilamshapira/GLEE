"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I think an equal 50-50 split is the fairest approach. We've already lost 5% to inflation, but an equal split maximizes our combined benefit. This way we both walk away with the same amount and can finish the game now before losing more value. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
