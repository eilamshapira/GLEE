"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair split. Let's end this quickly and keep the value of the money as high as possible! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer gives her 6000$ and me 4000$. While I appreciate her intention to end things quickly to avoid inflation, the split is clearly in her favor by 2000$. A fair split would be 5000$ each. However, I need to consider that rejecting means we lose 5% of the total value in the next round, which is 500$. I think I can make a more equitable proposal next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split that accounts for the inflation that has already occurred.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, I think an equal 50-50 split is the fairest approach. We've already lost 5% to inflation, but an equal split maximizes our combined benefit. This way we both walk away with the same amount and can finish the game now before losing more value.""}"
