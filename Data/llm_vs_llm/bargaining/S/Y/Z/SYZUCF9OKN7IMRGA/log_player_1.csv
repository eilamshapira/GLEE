"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split the money 60/40 in my favor. This is a fair offer considering I'm making the initial proposal. Let's not waste time with further negotiations and accept this offer.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's split the amount equally at 50/50. This way, both of us are treated fairly, and we can quickly reach an agreement without further rounds. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
