400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, a 50/50 split seems fair at first glance, but time is of the essence.  Let's make this happen quickly, I'll take a bit more to compensate for the time value, and we can both walk away happy. Deal?",Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I understand your time concerns, but I rejected your offer because inflation only affects your side, not mine. Since you're experiencing 10% inflation per round, this adjusted split actually gives you the equivalent value of $450000 now rather than waiting for a potentially lower real value later. This is a fair compromise considering our different inflation situations.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I appreciate your attempt at a compromise. However, your calculations seem to assume I'm willing to accept a significantly smaller share just because of my time preference.  This isn't the case.  I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor to account for the risk I'm taking by continuing these negotiations.  Let's get this done now.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
525000.0,475000.0,"Bob, I see we're getting closer. Given the 27.1% inflation you're facing, $475000 now is actually worth more to you than waiting for a higher nominal amount in future rounds. This split is fair considering our different positions - you get substantial value now before further inflation erodes your gains, and I get a reasonable share as well. Let's conclude this deal and both walk away with significant value.",Alice,5,
