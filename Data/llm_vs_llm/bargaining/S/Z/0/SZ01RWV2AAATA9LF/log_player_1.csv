Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, a 50/50 split seems fair at first glance, but time is of the essence.  Let's make this happen quickly, I'll take a bit more to compensate for the time value, and we can both walk away happy. Deal?

# Bob gain: 600000

Round 3

Since you're experiencing 10% inflation per round, this adjusted split actually gives you the equivalent value of $450,000 now rather than waiting for a potentially lower real value later. This is a fair compromise considering our different inflation situations.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your attempt at a compromise. However, your calculations seem to assume I'm willing to accept a significantly smaller share just because of my time preference.  This isn't the case.  I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor to account for the risk I'm taking by continuing these negotiations.  Let's get this done now.

# Bob gain: 550000

Given the 27.1% inflation you're facing, $475,000 now is actually worth more to you than waiting for a higher nominal amount in future rounds. This split is fair considering our different positions - you get substantial value now before further inflation erodes your gains, and I get a reasonable share as well. Let's conclude this deal and both walk away with significant value.""}"
