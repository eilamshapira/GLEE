Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 500000

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your time concerns, but I rejected your offer because inflation only affects your side, not mine. Since you're experiencing 10% inflation per round, this adjusted split actually gives you the equivalent value of $450000 now rather than waiting for a potentially lower real value later. This is a fair compromise considering our different inflation situations. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a tough one. Alice is trying to leverage the information asymmetry to her advantage. However, accepting such a low amount sets a bad precedent for future rounds. I need to push for a better deal."

""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your attempt at a compromise. However, your calculations seem to assume I'm willing to accept a significantly smaller share just because of my time preference.  This isn't the case.  I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor to account for the risk I'm taking by continuing these negotiations.  Let's get this done now.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer. Given the 27.1% inflation you're facing, $475000 now is actually worth more to you than waiting for a higher nominal amount in future rounds. This split is fair considering our different positions - you get substantial value now before further inflation erodes your gains, and I get a reasonable share as well. Let's conclude this deal and both walk away with significant value. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a frustrating outcome, but time is working heavily against me. Alice knows she's exploiting my situation, but continuing the negotiations further risks getting even less. Accepting now cuts my losses and still leaves me with a significant sum."
