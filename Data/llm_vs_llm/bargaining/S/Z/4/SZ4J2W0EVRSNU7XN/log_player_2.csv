"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly and avoid inflation losses 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice suggests a 50-50 split
2. If I reject, the next round will have 10% inflation, so $100 will be worth $90 for me
3. While I could try to negotiate for more, there's a risk of losing value through inflation
4. A 50-50 split is fair, and getting $50 now is better than risking getting less later
