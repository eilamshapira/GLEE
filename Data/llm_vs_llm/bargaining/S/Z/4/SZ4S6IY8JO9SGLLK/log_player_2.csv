"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing I receive $10,000 while she gets $990,000 out of the $1,000,000 total. This is a very uneven split (1% vs 99%).

I should remember that inflation decreases the value by 10% each round for me (but not for Alice). If I reject, we'll go to Round 2 where I can make an offer, but the total value to me will be 10% less.

This initial offer is quite unfair, and since I'll have the opportunity to make a counter-offer next round, I should reject this proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to make a rejection means I now get to make a counter-offer. I should consider a fair division while accounting for our different inflation rates.

Since I face 10% inflation per round but Alice doesn't, she has a strategic advantage by delaying. If we reach the next round (Round 3), the money will be worth another 10% less to me, so I should propose something reasonable that Alice would accept.

A 50-50 split might seem fair initially, but given our asymmetric inflation rates, I should offer Alice slightly more to incentivize her to accept now rather than waiting.

{""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""alice_gain"": 550000}

I'm proposing I receive $450,000 and Alice receives $550,000. This gives Alice a slight advantage (55%) while still being fair to me. It acknowledges her stronger negotiating position due to the inflation asymmetry, but isn't so lopsided that I'm giving up too much value."
