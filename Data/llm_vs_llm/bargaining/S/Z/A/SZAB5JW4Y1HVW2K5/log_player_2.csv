"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money equally for a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing an equal split of $5,000 each. Since this is just the first round, and inflation will reduce the value by 5% each round, I should evaluate whether waiting might lead to a better outcome.

If I reject and propose in the next round, the total amount would be worth 5% less to me, meaning the full $10,000 would be worth $9,500 from my perspective. Even if I could get more than $5,000 in the next round, I need to consider whether it would exceed the current $5,000 offer after accounting for inflation.

Given that this is a fair offer at the start and inflation will only reduce the value in future rounds, I'll accept.
