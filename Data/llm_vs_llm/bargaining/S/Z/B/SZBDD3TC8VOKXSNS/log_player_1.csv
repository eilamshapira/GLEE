"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split while accounting for potential future inflation if negotiations continue.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this division where I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. This is a reasonable split that gives me a slight advantage while still being fair enough that Bob might accept. If he declines, the money will be worth 20% less to me in the next round, so I'm incentivized to make a decent offer now."
