"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. 

Alice is offering a 50-50 split of $1,000,000, which means I would get $500,000. This is a fair division on the surface.

However, I need to factor in the inflation effect. If I reject this offer and we move to the next round, the money will be worth 5% less to me. That means in the next round, the $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $950,000 to me. Even if I were to get all of it (which is unlikely), I'd only receive the equivalent value of $950,000 from today's perspective.

Given that Alice's 50-50 split is fair and any delay would reduce my potential gain due to inflation, accepting this offer is the rational choice.
