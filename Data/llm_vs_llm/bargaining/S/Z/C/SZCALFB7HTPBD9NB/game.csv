580000.0,420000.0,"Alice, I know you valued your previous proposal at a 58–42 split, and I share the urgency to settle before inflation erodes our gains further—my share is falling more quickly. I'm matching that division so we can both lock in our outcomes now rather than risk even lower real values later. I believe this is our best chance to preserve value for both of us. Please accept this offer.",Bob,4,
