Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know you valued your previous proposal at a 58–42 split, and I share the urgency to settle before inflation erodes our gains further—my share is falling more quickly. I'm matching that division so we can both lock in our outcomes now rather than risk even lower real values later. I believe this is our best chance to preserve value for both of us. Please accept this offer. 
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000
