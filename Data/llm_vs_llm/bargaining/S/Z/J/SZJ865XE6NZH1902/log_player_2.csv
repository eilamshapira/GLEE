"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","While a 50-50 split seems fair on the surface, I need to consider the inflation factors. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total pot will be worth less to both of us (10% less for me, 5% less for Alice). 

Since this is the first round with no inflation yet, and we're starting with an even split, I'll accept this offer.
