"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a better balance would be 32% for me and 68% for you. Let's compromise! 
# Alice gain: 680000 
# Bob gain: 320000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a reasonable compromise. Since the money I gain is still worth the same, and Bob's offer gives me a larger share than my initial proposal, I'm inclined to accept.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
