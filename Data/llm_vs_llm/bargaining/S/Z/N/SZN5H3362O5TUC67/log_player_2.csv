"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split it fairly! I'm proposing 5500 for me and 4500 for you. This gives us both a good amount and ensures we don't risk losing it all by going through too many rounds. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is suggesting I take $4500 while she takes $5500. Given that we're in round 1 and I face 20% inflation per round, if I reject this offer, the total pot's value to me will decrease.

If I reject and we go to round 2, I'll make the next offer but the $10,000 will only be worth $8,000 to me. And if we continue to later rounds, the value diminishes further.

While a 50-50 split might seem more fair, getting $4500 now is better than risking further depreciation through inflation.
