"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically:

1. Alice offered me $60, which is more than half of the total amount
2. If I reject, we'll go to another round where:
   - I can make an offer
   - Alice's value of money will decrease by 20%
   - My value stays the same
3. In the next round, $40 would only be worth $32 to Alice
4. This means I could potentially make a more favorable offer next round

However, there's also risk in rejecting a decent offer:
- Alice might reject my next offer
- We could end up in a cycle of rejections
- If we reach round 12 without agreement, we both get nothing

$60 is already a good offer for me. While I could try to get more, the current offer is fair and secure.
