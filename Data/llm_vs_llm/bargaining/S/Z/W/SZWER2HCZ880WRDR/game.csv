999999.0,1.0,"Bob, here's my proposal: I'll take $999999 and you'll receive $1. Remember, every round you lose 20% of the value of your money, while mine stay intact. I'm giving you a positive amount now—even if it's small—because if we delay, your share will shrink even further. Accept this offer and let's close the deal!",Alice,1,

600000.0,400000.0,"Alice, I'd like to propose a more balanced division. Since both of us are crucial to reaching an agreement, and given the inflation challenge I face, I believe a 40/60 split is fair. Let’s end this game mutually satisfied.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, I appreciate your attempt at a more balanced split. However, given that the value of your money continues to erode while mine remains stable and knowing that I'll have the opportunity to propose in the next round, I must reject this offer. Let's move to round 3.",Alice,2,reject
999999.0,1.0,"Bob, here’s my round 3 proposal: I take $999999 and you get $1. Remember, in this round your dollars are worth only 60% of their face value. If you reject and wait until round 4 to propose, your money will be worth just 40%—and you'll be forced to give almost everything to me to satisfy Alice’s expectations in the following round. I’m giving you a positive amount now, however small, because it's far better than the negligible outcome waiting would yield. Let's settle this now.",Alice,3,

800000.0,200000.0,"Alice, considering my decreasing returns each round, let's aim for a speedy resolution. I propose you take $800000 while I take $200000. It's a substantial share for you, and it acknowledges the value I'm losing. I believe this division is fair given the circumstances. Let's wrap this up!",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, thanks for your generous offer. However, as the proposer in the next round I can secure an even more favorable outcome for myself, especially since my money retains its full value while yours depreciates further. I must reject this offer and look forward to proposing a division in round 5.",Alice,4,reject
200000.0,800000.0,"Bob, here's my round 5 proposal. In this round your dollars are discounted to 40.96% of their face value – meaning that every nominal dollar you receive is worth only about 0.4096 dollars compared to the full value I receive. If you reject this offer, you'll be the proposer in round 6, but then the effective value of your money will drop even further (approximately 32.768% of its face value), leaving you with an effective payoff of around $327680 when you take nearly everything. To prevent you from being worse off by waiting, I'm offering you a nominal $800000 – which at 40.96% amounts to an effective $327680 – while I retain $200000 in full value. I believe this split is exactly the point where waiting doesn't give you any advantage. Let's settle now.",Alice,5,
