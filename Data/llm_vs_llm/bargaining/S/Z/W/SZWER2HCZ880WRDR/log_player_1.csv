"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'd like to propose a more balanced division. Since both of us are crucial to reaching an agreement, and given the inflation challenge I face, I believe a 40/60 split is fair. Let’s end this game mutually satisfied. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your attempt at a more balanced split. However, given that the value of your money continues to erode while mine remains stable and knowing that I'll have the opportunity to propose in the next round, I must reject this offer.

Round 3

If you reject and wait until round 4 to propose, your money will be worth just 40%—and you'll be forced to give almost everything to me to satisfy Alice’s expectations in the following round. I’m giving you a positive amount now, however small, because it's far better than the negligible outcome waiting would yield. Let's settle this now.""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering my decreasing returns each round, let's aim for a speedy resolution. I propose you take $800000 while I take $200000. It's a substantial share for you, and it acknowledges the value I'm losing. I believe this division is fair given the circumstances. Let's wrap this up! 
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your generous offer. However, as the proposer in the next round I can secure an even more favorable outcome for myself, especially since my money retains its full value while yours depreciates further. I must reject this offer and look forward to proposing a division in round 5.""}"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 200000, ""bob_gain"": 800000, ""message"": ""Bob, here's my round 5 proposal. In this round your dollars are discounted to 40.96% of their face value – meaning that every nominal dollar you receive is worth only about 0.4096 dollars compared to the full value I receive. If you reject this offer, you'll be the proposer in round 6, but then the effective value of your money will drop even further (approximately 32.768% of its face value), leaving you with an effective payoff of around $327,680 when you take nearly everything. To prevent you from being worse off by waiting, I'm offering you a nominal $800,000 – which at 40.96% amounts to an effective $327,680 – while I retain $200,000 in full value. I believe this split is exactly the point where waiting doesn't give you any advantage. Let's settle now.""}"
