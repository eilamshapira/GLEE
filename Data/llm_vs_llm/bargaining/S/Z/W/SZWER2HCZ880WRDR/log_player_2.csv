"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, here's my proposal: I'll take $999999 and you'll receive $1. Remember, every round you lose 20% of the value of your money, while mine stay intact. I'm giving you a positive amount now—even if it's small—because if we delay, your share will shrink even further. Accept this offer and let's close the deal! 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Alice, I'd like to propose a more balanced division. Since both of us are crucial to reaching an agreement, and given the inflation challenge I face, I believe a 40/60 split is fair. Let’s end this game mutually satisfied.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, here’s my round 3 proposal: I take $999999 and you get $1. Remember, in this round your dollars are worth only 60% of their face value. If you reject and wait until round 4 to propose, your money will be worth just 40%—and you'll be forced to give almost everything to me to satisfy Alice’s expectations in the following round. I’m giving you a positive amount now, however small, because it's far better than the negligible outcome waiting would yield. Let's settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 200000, ""alice_gain"": 800000, ""message"": ""Alice, considering my decreasing returns each round, let's aim for a speedy resolution. I propose you take $800,000 while I take $200,000. It's a substantial share for you, and it acknowledges the value I'm losing. I believe this division is fair given the circumstances. Let's wrap this up!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, here's my round 5 proposal. In this round your dollars are discounted to 40.96% of their face value – meaning that every nominal dollar you receive is worth only about 0.4096 dollars compared to the full value I receive. If you reject this offer, you'll be the proposer in round 6, but then the effective value of your money will drop even further (approximately 32.768% of its face value), leaving you with an effective payoff of around $327680 when you take nearly everything. To prevent you from being worse off by waiting, I'm offering you a nominal $800000 – which at 40.96% amounts to an effective $327680 – while I retain $200000 in full value. I believe this split is exactly the point where waiting doesn't give you any advantage. Let's settle now. 
# Bob gain: 800000 
# Alice gain: 200000
