Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it equally. This way, neither of us is advantaged over the other, and we both walk away with a reasonable amount. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Reasoning (not part of response): Given the 20% inflation penalty, if I reject this offer, my next offer would be worth 20% less to me. Even if I tried to get more in the next round, say 65$, it would only be worth 52$ to me due to inflation. The current 50-50 split gives me 50$ value now, which is better than risking further rounds with increasing inflation penalties. It's a fair offer and accepting it is the rational choice."
