"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Based on a backward‐induction style reasoning (taking into account that if Bob rejects the round‑1 offer he will be the proposer in round 2—and with his money losing only 5% per round while mine loses 20% per round, his “waiting” power is much higher), my proposal is to keep a very small slice and award Bob almost all of the $10,000 immediately. (In a perfect equilibrium Bob’s next–round “threat value” is roughly 95% of $10,000, i.e. $9,500 in round‑2 nominal terms. To make him just slightly better off accepting immediately, I must give him a bit more than 9,500.)

Thus my round‑1 offer is as follows (the numbers being in whole dollars):

{""alice_gain"": 499, ""bob_gain"": 9501}

If Bob accepts now, we split $10,000 as proposed. (If he rejects, the pie will be split in round 2—with even less value for me because of my steeper 20% round‑by‑round loss—and Bob’s position improves.)"
