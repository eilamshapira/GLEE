Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's try a near-fair division. I propose 55 for me and 45 for you. This slight advantage for me as the offer maker reflects our shifting roles, but itâ€™s a fair split compared to earlier extremes. I believe this balanced offer will benefit both of us if we settle now.
