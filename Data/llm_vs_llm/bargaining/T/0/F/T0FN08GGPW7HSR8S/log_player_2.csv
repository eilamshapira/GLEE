"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

This is the first round, so there's no inflation impact yet. Alice is offering me 4500$ out of 10,000$, which is 45% of the total.

While this isn't a 50-50 split, it's a reasonably fair offer. If I reject, the next round will have 10% inflation, meaning the total value for me would be worth less. To get a better deal in the next round, I would need to secure significantly more than 4500$ to make up for the inflation loss.

Given that:
1. The offer is fairly reasonable (45%)
2. Rejecting means dealing with inflation
3. There's no guarantee Alice would accept a more favorable offer from me
4. We have limited rounds before we both get nothing
