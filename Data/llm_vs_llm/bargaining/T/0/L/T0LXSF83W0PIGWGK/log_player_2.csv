"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","I should consider that the money loses 20% of its value for me each round. If I reject now, I make the next offer, but the total value for me will be 20% less. Let me think about this strategically.

Alice offered me $10 out of $100, keeping $90 for herself. That's quite uneven. 

If I reject this offer, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the total money will be worth only $80 to me due to the 20% inflation (while still worth $100 to Alice). 

Given the strong disadvantage from inflation, I should make a more balanced counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to propose a fair division that accounts for the inflation penalty I face. Since I'm facing 20% inflation per round, I should propose a deal that Alice would likely accept.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing an equal split of the money. This is fair to both of us, and given that I face inflation in future rounds while Alice doesn't, it's in both our interests to conclude this quickly. A 50-50 split represents a balanced compromise that respects both our interests."
