"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me propose a fair split that accounts for the higher inflation rate I face.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor since I face higher inflation (20% vs 10%) in future rounds. This way we can both benefit by agreeing early rather than letting inflation eat away at the total value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

If I accept now:
- I get $4000, but with 20% inflation, it's worth $3200 to me
- Bob gets $6000, with 10% inflation, worth $5400 to him

If I reject and propose in next round:
- Values will depreciate further (40% for me, 30% for Bob)
- Even if I propose a better split, Bob might reject again
- The total value keeps diminishing for both of us

While this isn't ideal, waiting another round will likely result in even less value for both of us due to compounding inflation effects.
