"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm proposing a fair split that slightly favors me to account for the 20% inflation penalty I face. If we go to round 3, any money I receive will be worth even less to me, while yours retains full value. This is a reasonable offer that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
