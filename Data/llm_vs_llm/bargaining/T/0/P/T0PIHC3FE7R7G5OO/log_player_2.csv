"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer ensures you get a good chunk while I get a bit more. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer would give me $300,000 while she takes $700,000. This is quite uneven despite her claim of being ""reasonable."" With inflation affecting only my money (20% less each round), I need to consider if a better deal is possible in the next round versus taking this offer now.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2, any amount I receive would be worth 20% less to me. However, I still have the opportunity to propose a more equitable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split that accounts for the inflation disadvantage I face while still being attractive to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I'm proposing a fair split that slightly favors me to account for the 20% inflation penalty I face. If we go to round 3, any money I receive will be worth even less to me, while yours retains full value. This is a reasonable offer that benefits us both.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a larger piece of the pie.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but this is a fair deal considering the inflation working against you. Let's close this out. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has offered me $350,000 (now worth only 64% of its original value due to 36% inflation) while she takes $650,000. This means my actual value would be $224,000 in round 1 terms.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 4, I would face 48% total inflation, making any amount significantly less valuable to me, while Alice faces no penalty for delay.

Alice has only slightly improved her offer from round 1 ($300,000 to $350,000), but given the mounting inflation penalty I face, further negotiations would likely diminish my returns.
