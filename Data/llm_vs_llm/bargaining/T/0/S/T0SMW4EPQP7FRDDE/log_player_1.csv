"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer to divide the $1,000,000.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering a fair split where I (Alice) get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000. This gives you a substantial amount while I get slightly more as the first mover. If we move to the next round, the total value will decrease by 20% to $800,000, so we both benefit by agreeing now rather than letting inflation reduce our gains."
