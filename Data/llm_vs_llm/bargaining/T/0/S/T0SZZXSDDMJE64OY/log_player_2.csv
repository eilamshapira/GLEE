Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given the inflation and Alice's initial greedy offer, I'll make a counter-offer that is more favorable to me but still gives Alice a significant portion. I need to consider that the value of the money decreases by 10% each round for me.

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, this is getting risky. I'm losing value fast. I need to consider that I might walk away with nothing.
