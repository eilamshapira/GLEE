"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this... 

Alice is offering me $40 while keeping $60 for herself. This isn't an equal split, but if I reject:
1. The total amount will decrease by 5% to $95 in the next round
2. I'll get to make a counter-proposal
3. But Alice could still reject my offer, leading to further devaluation

While $40 isn't ideal, if I reject and propose a more favorable split next round, Alice might reject it, and we'd both end up with less due to inflation.

$40 is still a significant portion and better than risking further rounds of negotiation with guaranteed value loss.
