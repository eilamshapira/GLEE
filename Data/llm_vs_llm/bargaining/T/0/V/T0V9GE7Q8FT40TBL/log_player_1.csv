"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I want to factor in the inflation and also make a reasonable offer to avoid too many rounds. Here's my proposal:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the inflation and Bob's offer. My money is now worth 90% of its original value, and Bob's is worth 95%.

Let's calculate the effective value of Bob's offer:

*   Alice's gain: $450,000
*   Bob's gain: $550,000

If I reject this, my money will be worth even less next round. Bob's offer is not very generous, but it might be better than risking another round. Let's think about it:

If I reject, I expect to gain more than 450k in the next round to offset the loss from inflation.

Given the circumstances, I will accept the offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
