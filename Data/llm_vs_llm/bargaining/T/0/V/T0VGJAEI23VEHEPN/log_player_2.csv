"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it equally. It's fair and we both get a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. The offer is a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
2. If I reject, I can make my own offer next round
3. However, due to 10% inflation, if I wait:
   * Next round the $10,000 will only be worth $9,000 to me
   * My maximum possible gain would be lower than the current $5,000 offer

Given that inflation will reduce the value of any future deals for me, and this is a fair split, I should accept now rather than risk getting less in future rounds.
