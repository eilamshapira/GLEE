"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my first offer to Bob. Since I'll lose 20% of the value in the next round while Bob only loses 10%, I should offer something reasonable to avoid escalation.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'd like to propose a 60/40 split in my favor. Bob, I believe this is a fair division considering the asymmetric inflation penalties we face. If we move to another round, both of us will lose value, but I'll be more affected than you."
