"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether to accept or reject this offer. Alice is suggesting a 4000 to 6000 split in her favor.

If I reject, we go to the next round where I can make a counteroffer, but the money will be worth 10% less to me and 20% less to Alice. So effectively, the $10,000 becomes worth $9,000 to me and $8,000 to Alice in the next round.

Let me analyze: If I reject and propose in the next round, I could offer something like 5500 for me and 4500 for Alice. After the 20% depreciation for Alice, her 4500 would be worth about 3600 in current-round terms, which is less than the 6000 she's offering herself now. So she would likely reject.

The 4000 offer is not ideal but given the inflation mechanics, I think I should accept.
