"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer in JSON format:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the offer.

Since my money is worth less now due to inflation, I need to consider that. My effective gain in round 1 was 60, but now I should evaluate the offer in terms of the current value of money.
The current money is worth 10% less so the 100$ is now worth 90$ for me.
The Bob's offer: Alice gain: 50, Bob gain: 50. It means that I will receive 50$, but the current value is 50 * 0.9 = 45$.

I reject this offer.
```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand. Remember, the value of my money is still decreasing due to inflation. The initial $100 is now worth 0.9 * 0.9 = 81$ for me.

Here's my offer:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the situation. The initial $100 is now worth 100 * (1 - 0.271) = 72.9$ for me.

Bob's offer: Alice gets 45, Bob gets 55.
Considering inflation, I will get 45$ in this round.
My effective gain is 45/100 * 72.9 = 32.805

I reject this offer.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand. Inflation continues to erode the value of the money for me. The initial $100 is now worth approximately 100 * (1 - 0.271) * 0.9 = 65.61 for me.

Here's my offer:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}
