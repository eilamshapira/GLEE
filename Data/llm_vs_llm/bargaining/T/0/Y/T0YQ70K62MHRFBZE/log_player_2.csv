"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Take it or leave it, Bob. You're getting a thousand dollars, which is more than you deserve.  ðŸ˜‰ 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 65/35 split in my favor. It's a good deal for you considering the inflation and the risk of getting even less in future rounds. Don't be greedy!""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both at a loss here. Let's split it evenly, 50/50. It's fair and avoids us both losing more to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

Alice's offer is now much more reasonable and a 50/50 split avoids the risk of further losses due to inflation for both of us.  It's time to be pragmatic."
