"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split that accounts for the different inflation rates we face. Since my value drops faster (20% per round) compared to Bob's (5% per round), I should aim for a reasonable first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I believe this 60-40 split is fair considering that if Bob rejects, the total value will depreciate more significantly for me than for him in the next round. This offer gives Bob a substantial portion while protecting my interests against the higher inflation rate I face."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. With 20% inflation for me, $4000 is now worth $3200 to me
2. In the next round, I could propose again, but:
   - The money would be worth another 20% less to me
   - Any counter-offer would be worth less to both of us
   - Bob would still have leverage due to the inflation difference

While this offer is less than my initial proposal, waiting another round would decrease the value significantly more for me than for Bob due to our different inflation rates. The asymmetric inflation rates put me at a disadvantage in prolonged negotiations.
