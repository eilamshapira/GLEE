550000.0,450000.0,"Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking for a more equitable split. I'm proposing you get $550000 and I get $450000, which acknowledges your slightly better position due to inflation rates (20% for me vs 5% for you). This is fair and allows us both to walk away with a substantial amount without risking further depreciation.",Bob,2,
