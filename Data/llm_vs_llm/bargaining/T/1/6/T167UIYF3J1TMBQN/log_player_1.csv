Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking for a more equitable split. I'm proposing you get $550000 and I get $450000, which acknowledges your slightly better position due to inflation rates (20% for me vs 5% for you). This is fair and allows us both to walk away with a substantial amount without risking further depreciation. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
