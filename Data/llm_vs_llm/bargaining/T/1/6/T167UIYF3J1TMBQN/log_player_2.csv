"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm proposing a very generous offer. Let's end this quickly and make sure we both get something! Take the 100k and let's be done with it. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully, taking into account the inflation rates and the remaining rounds.

Alice is offering me $100,000 out of the $1,000,000 total, which is only 10% of the pot. This seems quite low for an equal division.

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in round 2. However, I need to be aware that with each round, my money depreciates by 20% while Alice's only depreciates by 5%. This gives her a stronger position in later rounds.

Given that my inflation rate is significantly higher than Alice's, I should aim to resolve this relatively quickly, but I should still negotiate for a fairer share than just 10%.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a fair offer that accounts for both our positions, including the different inflation rates we face.

{""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking for a more equitable split. I'm proposing you get $550,000 and I get $450,000, which acknowledges your slightly better position due to inflation rates (20% for me vs 5% for you). This is fair and allows us both to walk away with a substantial amount without risking further depreciation.""}"
