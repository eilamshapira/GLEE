0.0,100.0,"Hi Bob, here's my proposal: you get the entire $100 and I take nothing. Since the money loses 10% of its value for me each round while yours remains intact, I realize that if you reject this offer you’ll eventually hold the proposal power yourself and still secure all $100. To avoid further delays (and my own discount losses), I’m offering you the full amount now. I look forward to your acceptance!",Alice,1,
