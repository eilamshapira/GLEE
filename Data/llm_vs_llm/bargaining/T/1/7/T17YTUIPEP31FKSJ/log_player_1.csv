"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 0, ""bob_gain"": 100, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal: you get the entire $100 and I take nothing. Since the money loses 10% of its value for me each round while yours remains intact, I realize that if you reject this offer you’ll eventually hold the proposal power yourself and still secure all $100. To avoid further delays (and my own discount losses), I’m offering you the full amount now. I look forward to your acceptance!""}"
