"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal: you get the entire $100 and I take nothing. Since the money loses 10% of its value for me each round while yours remains intact, I realize that if you reject this offer you’ll eventually hold the proposal power yourself and still secure all $100. To avoid further delays (and my own discount losses), I’m offering you the full amount now. I look forward to your acceptance! 
# Bob gain: 100 
# Alice gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
