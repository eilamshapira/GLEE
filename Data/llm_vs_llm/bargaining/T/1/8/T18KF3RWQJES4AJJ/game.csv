550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm offering you 45% of the money ($450000) which I believe is fair. Since we both face inflation with each round, it's in our mutual interest to agree now rather than later. If we go to the next round, my money would be worth 20% less, and I assume yours would be too.",Alice,1,
