"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I need to make a strategic offer that accounts for the 20% inflation each round. Since this affects me, it's in my interest to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. I should offer Bob a fair amount that he's likely to accept right away.

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you 45% of the money ($450,000) which I believe is fair. Since we both face inflation with each round, it's in our mutual interest to agree now rather than later. If we go to the next round, my money would be worth 20% less, and I assume yours would be too.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55/45 is a fairer split, as we both face inflation.  Let's agree now and avoid the risk of losing more in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
