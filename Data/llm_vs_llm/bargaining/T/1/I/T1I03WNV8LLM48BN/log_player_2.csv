"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split this fairly and end the game now. I'm giving you a generous amount. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of the $10,000, which is 40% of the total. While it's not an even split, I need to keep in mind that inflation will reduce the value by 10% each round if I reject.

If I reject and make a counteroffer in round 2, the total value to me will only be $9,000 (10% less). So even if I were to propose a 50-50 split in the next round ($4,500 for me), I'd only be gaining $500 more than the current offer - and that's only if Alice accepts.

Since Alice's initial offer is reasonable considering the inflation penalty, and continuing the negotiation may lead to diminishing returns for me:
