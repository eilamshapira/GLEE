310345.0,689655.0,"Alice, I believe this proposal reflects our future expectations fairly. By accepting this division now—where you secure 310345 and I receive 689655—we both avoid further devaluation. Think of it as locking in a better outcome for you compared to waiting another round, given the 10% depreciation you face. I look forward to your agreement.",Bob,2,

450000.0,550000.0,"Considering the inflation, let's find a middle ground before it's too late",Alice,3,
,,"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to seek a middle ground, the current offer would leave me with an effective value of about 496375 in today’s terms. Given that if we postpone one more round—with me proposing—you’d face an even greater devaluation and I would be in a position to secure almost the entire pie (even discounting my share)—I’m inclined to hold out for a proposal that better reflects our positions. Let's continue negotiating for a more balanced outcome.",Bob,3,reject
310345.0,689655.0,"Alice, time is working against us both. Every round of delay reduces the real value of the money—in round4 you’d see each dollar worth 0.729 of its initial value, while if you wait until you propose in round5, your effective value would drop further (to a multiplier of 0.6561). With this offer, you secure a nominal 310345, which in today’s terms is about what you’d get even in round5. Accepting now locks in your best possible outcome. I hope you agree that avoiding further devaluation is in both our interests.",Bob,4,
