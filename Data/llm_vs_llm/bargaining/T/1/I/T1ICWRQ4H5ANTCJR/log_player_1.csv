"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I believe this proposal reflects our future expectations fairly. By accepting this division now—where you secure 310345 and I receive 689655—we both avoid further devaluation. Think of it as locking in a better outcome for you compared to waiting another round, given the 10% depreciation you face. I look forward to your agreement. 
# Alice gain: 310345 
# Bob gain: 689655 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the fact that the money I gain is worth 10% less, I should think about the future rounds and the potential loss of value.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob compared to the previous round. 

In Round 1, the value was $1,000,000.
In Round 2, the value for me was $1,000,000 * 0.9 = $900,000 and for Bob was $1,000,000 * 0.95 = $950,000.
In Round 3, the value for me is $900,000 * 0.9 = $810,000 and for Bob is $950,000 * 0.95 = $902,500.

I'll make an offer that takes into account the decreasing value:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's find a middle ground before it's too late""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, time is working against us both. Every round of delay reduces the real value of the money—in round4 you’d see each dollar worth 0.729 of its initial value, while if you wait until you propose in round5, your effective value would drop further (to a multiplier of 0.6561). With this offer, you secure a nominal 310345, which in today’s terms is about what you’d get even in round5. Accepting now locks in your best possible outcome. I hope you agree that avoiding further devaluation is in both our interests. 
# Alice gain: 310345 
# Bob gain: 689655 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer seems to be the same as in Round 2, but considering the inflation and the decreasing value of the money, I should think about the potential loss of value in the next round.

If I reject this offer and go to Round 5, the value for me would be $1,000,000 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = $656,100, and for Bob, it would be $1,000,000 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 = $814,506.25.

Given that the offer of $310,345 is close to what I would get in the next round, and considering the significant decrease in value for me, I should accept this offer to avoid further devaluation.
