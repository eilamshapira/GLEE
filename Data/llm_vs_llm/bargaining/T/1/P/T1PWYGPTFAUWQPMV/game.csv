0.0,1000000.0,"Hi Bob – to avoid further delay (which only worsens my situation due to the 10% per round depreciation on my end), I propose that you take the entire $1000000 while I take nothing. Since if you reject you’d simply secure nearly the full amount in the next round, this offer gives you essentially the same benefit immediately. I look forward to your acceptance.",Alice,1,
