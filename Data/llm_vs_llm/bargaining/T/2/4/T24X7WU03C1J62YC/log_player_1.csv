"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering the first-mover advantage, and it ensures we both get a substantial amount.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's aim for a fairer split. I propose 55 for me and 45 for you. This is more equitable and ensures we both walk away with a good amount. This is a good deal. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
- If I accept now, I get $45, but due to 10% inflation, it's only worth $40.5 to me
- If I reject and make a new offer in the next round, any amount I get will be worth 20% less due to inflation
- Even if I managed to get $60 in the next round, it would only be worth $48 to me
- There's also a risk Bob rejects my next offer, leading to even more inflation
