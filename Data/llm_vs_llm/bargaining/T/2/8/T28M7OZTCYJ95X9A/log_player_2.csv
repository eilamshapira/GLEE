"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice offered me $40 while keeping $60 for herself. Given that:
1. The money doesn't lose value for me over rounds
2. The money loses 10% value for Alice each round
3. We have 11 more rounds if I reject

If I reject, in the next round I can make a counter-offer where the money is worth 10% less to Alice. This gives me negotiating leverage. I can potentially get a better deal since Alice would be more motivated to accept a higher amount for herself quickly before the value decreases further.

Therefore, I'll reject this initial offer to negotiate for a better split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that money is now worth 10% less to Alice, I'll propose a more favorable split for me while still giving Alice enough incentive to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

A 55-45 split in my favor is reasonable because:
1. Alice's money has already depreciated 10%, so her $45 is effectively worth $40.50 to her
2. If she rejects, her next round's money will be worth even less
3. It's still a relatively fair split that doesn't appear too greedy
4. We both have incentive to finish early rather than drag this out for many rounds"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $45
2. She wants $55, but for her it's actually worth only $44.55 (due to 19% depreciation)
3. The money maintains full value for me
4. If I reject, I can make another offer next round when her money will be worth even less
5. We still have 9 rounds left

Since the money maintains its value for me and continues to depreciate for Alice, I have a stronger negotiating position. I can likely get a better deal in the next round as Alice's portion continues to lose value.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since we're in round 4, Alice's money has depreciated by 27.1% (1 - 0.9^3). This gives me more leverage to propose a better split in my favor, as any delay makes Alice's portion worth less to her.

{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35}

Reasoning:
1. For Alice, $35 is now actually worth about $25.50 due to the depreciation
2. If she rejects, her next round's money will be worth even less
3. The deteriorating value of money for Alice makes it rational for her to accept a smaller nominal amount now rather than wait
4. We still need to reach an agreement within 8 rounds to avoid both getting nothing
5. This offer increases pressure on Alice to accept while still leaving her with a meaningful amount"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering a 50-50 split
2. For Alice, her $50 is actually worth only about $32.80 (due to 34.39% depreciation)
3. My $50 maintains full value
4. We have 7 rounds left
5. Alice's money will continue to depreciate by about 10% each round

Even though a 50-50 split might seem fair at first glance, I'm in a stronger negotiating position because:
1. Alice's portion is rapidly losing value to her
2. My portion maintains its value
3. There are still several rounds left
4. Each round makes Alice's position weaker due to depreciation

Therefore, I believe I can get a better deal by rejecting this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","At this point, Alice's money has depreciated by 40.95% (1 - 0.9^5). The situation is becoming more pressing for Alice as her money continues to lose significant value. However, I also need to be careful not to be too aggressive as we still need to reach an agreement to avoid both getting zero.

{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30}

Reasoning:
1. For Alice, $30 is now actually worth about $17.71 due to the 40.95% depreciation
2. If she rejects, her next round's money will be worth even less
3. We have 6 rounds left, but the risk of no agreement is increasing
4. This offer, while strongly in my favor, still gives Alice enough incentive to accept rather than risk further depreciation
5. The rapidly deteriorating value of money for Alice makes accepting a smaller amount now more rational than holding out for more"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $55
2. She wants $45, but for her it's actually worth only about $23.93 (due to 46.86% depreciation)
3. My $55 maintains full value
4. We have 5 rounds left
5. Alice's money will continue to depreciate rapidly

While $55 is better than previous offers, I still have a strong negotiating position because:
1. Alice's money has lost almost half its value
2. Each round makes her position even weaker
3. We still have enough rounds left to negotiate
4. I maintain full value of my money

Given these factors, I believe I can still get a better deal by rejecting.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100.","At this point, Alice's money has depreciated by 52.17% (1 - 0.9^7). We're now in round 8 out of 12, so the risk of no agreement is becoming more significant. I need to balance between leveraging my strong position and ensuring we reach an agreement.

{""bob_gain"": 75, ""alice_gain"": 25}

Reasoning:
1. For Alice, $25 is now actually worth only about $11.96 due to the 52.17% depreciation
2. We have only 4 rounds left after this one
3. While this is a strong offer in my favor, it's not as aggressive as my previous offer
4. The rapid depreciation makes it increasingly rational for Alice to accept a smaller amount now
5. With each passing round, Alice's negotiating position weakens significantly
6. This offer gives Alice a clear signal that accepting now is better than risking further rounds where her share would be worth even less"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation carefully:

1. Alice is offering me $60
2. Her $40 is actually worth only about $17.22 to her (due to 56.95% depreciation)
3. My $60 maintains full value
4. We only have 3 rounds left after this one
5. The risk of getting nothing is becoming significant

While I've been rejecting offers to leverage the depreciation, I need to consider:
1. We're getting close to the end (round 9 of 12)
2. Each rejection risks the possibility of no agreement
3. $60 is a decent offer for me
4. Alice might become more stubborn in later rounds to avoid getting very little

Given these factors, especially the limited remaining rounds and the decent offer for me, I think it's prudent to accept this offer now.
