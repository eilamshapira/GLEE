"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40 in my favor. It's a fair start, and we can negotiate from here. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a counter-offer in the next round. 60-40 in Alice's favor isn't fair when an equal split is possible."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. This way we both get an equal share, which is the most equitable solution.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: How about I get 55 and you get 45? It's closer to your fair split, but I still get a bit more. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this compromise. While it's not perfectly equal, it's a reasonable offer and better than risking further negotiations that might lead to both of us getting nothing."
