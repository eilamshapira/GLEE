"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering you lose more value than me with delays, so it's in your interest to accept now. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $400,000 of the $1,000,000, while she gets $600,000.

She's right that I face steeper inflation (20% per round) than she does (10% per round). If I reject this offer:
- In round 2, the $1,000,000 would be worth $800,000 to me due to 20% inflation
- I could propose a different split, but Alice could reject it
- If we keep going, my potential earnings decrease faster than hers

While a 50-50 split might seem fairer, the asymmetric inflation rate puts me at a disadvantage in negotiations. Getting $400,000 now is better than potentially less in future rounds after inflation.
