"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5263, ""bob_gain"": 4737, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that we divide the $10,000 so that I receive $5,263 and you receive $4,737. Given that every subsequent round devalues our total pot by 10%, this split reflects the fair equilibrium outcome if we were to bargain further. I believe this is a fair proposal for us both to maximize our returns without waiting. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think we can both do better than your offer. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor, recognizing that the money loses value with each round.  Let's be practical and come to an agreement. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
