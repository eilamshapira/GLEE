"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that we divide the $10000 so that I receive $5263 and you receive $4737. Given that every subsequent round devalues our total pot by 10%, this split reflects the fair equilibrium outcome if we were to bargain further. I believe this is a fair proposal for us both to maximize our returns without waiting. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4737 
# Alice gain: 5263
