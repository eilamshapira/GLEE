"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","While the offer is for an even split, which seems fair at first glance, I need to consider the inflation dynamic in this game. Since inflation affects Alice (10% per round) but not me (0%), I have a strategic advantage in rejecting early equal offers.

If we move to the next round, I can propose a division that accounts for this asymmetry. The money will be worth 10% less to Alice in the next round, which gives me negotiating leverage.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I rejected Alice's 50-50 split, I'll now make a counterproposal that accounts for the inflation asymmetry. Alice now values the money 10% less than in Round 1, so I'll propose a division that's more favorable to me while still being attractive enough for Alice to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering myself $550,000 and Alice $450,000, which reflects the 10% inflation that affects Alice's valuation. This is fair because from Alice's perspective, $450,000 now is comparable to what $500,000 would have been worth to her in the previous round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice has rejected my previous offer and is now offering me $480,000 while taking $520,000 for herself.

While this is less than the 50-50 split initially offered, I need to consider:
1. The inflation effect continues - money is now worth 19% less for Alice than in round 1
2. If I reject, we move to round 4 where I make an offer, but Alice's inflation will be at 27.1%
3. We have a limited number of rounds, and risk getting nothing if we can't agree

Alice's offer gives me 48% of the total, which is less than her original 50% offer, but time is passing and strategic considerations must be weighed against the risk of continued disagreement.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since we're now in round 4, Alice's money has depreciated by approximately 27.1% from the first round due to the compounding 10% inflation per round. Given this increasing inflation effect and the fact that we have a limited number of rounds remaining, I'll propose a more favorable division for myself while still making it attractive enough for Alice to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I'm offering myself $600,000 and Alice $400,000. This accounts for the inflation effect on Alice's side while still giving her a substantial portion. Since Alice's valuation of money continues to decrease with each round, this offer should be more attractive to her than waiting for future rounds where her share would be worth even less."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 540000 
# Alice gain: 460000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to analyze this situation carefully:

- Alice has offered me $540,000 (54% of the total)
- This is a $60,000 increase from her previous offer
- We're now in round 5 of 12 maximum rounds
- Alice's money is worth 34.39% less to her than in round 1
- If I reject, we'll move to round 6, where I make another offer
- In round 6, Alice's inflation would be approximately 41% from round 1

Alice appears to be gradually increasing her offers to me. While I might get a better deal by rejecting, there's also the risk of failing to reach agreement within the 12 rounds. This offer gives me a majority of the money, and we're making progress toward a resolution.
