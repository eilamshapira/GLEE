"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for herself
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 20% less in the next round
3. $400,000 now is better than $500,000 in the next round (which would only be worth $400,000 due to inflation)
4. While the split isn't 50-50, it's still a substantial amount
5. There's risk in rejecting as we only have 12 rounds and inflation will keep reducing value
