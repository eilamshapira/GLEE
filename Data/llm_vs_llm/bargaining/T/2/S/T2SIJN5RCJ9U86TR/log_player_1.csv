"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make my offer to Bob, taking into account the inflation factor that affects his valuation of the money.

{""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that accounts for the 10% inflation penalty you face per round. If we go to the next round, your money will be worth less. This offer gives you $450,000 in real value now, which is better than waiting.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I'm proposing an even split of the $1000000. This is a fair division for both of us. Let's agree on this and conclude the game with equal shares. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
