"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that accounts for the 10% inflation penalty you face per round. If we go to the next round, your money will be worth less. This offer gives you $450000 in real value now, which is better than waiting. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Hello Alice, I'm proposing an even split of the $1,000,000. This is a fair division for both of us. Let's agree on this and conclude the game with equal shares.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, by now you've seen how inflation affects your position. If we go to round 4, your money will be worth 30% less than in round 1. My offer gives you $400000 in real value now, which is better than waiting further. This is a rational division given the asymmetric inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
