"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split the $100 with me receiving $60 and you receiving $40. This way, we both get a good portion before inflation reduces the value. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 10% inflation, any amount I get next round will be worth 10% less
4. If I counter-offer next round and get $50, it would actually be worth $45 due to inflation
5. $40 now is better than risking further rounds with inflation
