"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Alice's offer, the $30 I gain would be worth approximately $30 * 0.64 = $19.2 (since it's 36% less valuable to me).

Given this, I think I can try to get a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, the total value of the money is decreasing. Since I don't know the exact inflation rate for Alice, I'll try to make a reasonable offer.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Alice's offer, the $40 I gain would be worth approximately $40 * 0.4096 = $16.384 (since it's 59.04% less valuable to me).

Given this significant decrease in value, I'm inclined to accept this offer to get something rather than risking further inflation.
