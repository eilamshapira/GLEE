"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I hope you find this acceptable. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000, which is a 40/60 split in her favor. While this isn't an equal division, it's substantial enough that I should consider it seriously.

Since this is just the first round and I don't face any inflation penalty, I have the advantage of being able to counter-offer in the next round if I reject. I could propose a more favorable split for myself.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more balanced while still acknowledging Alice's initial position.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think an equal 50/50 split would be the fairest approach for both of us. This way we both walk away with the same amount.""}"
