550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split where I get 55% and you get 45%. If we go to the next round, the money will be worth less to me due to inflation, but I believe this is a reasonable division that benefits us both without needing further negotiation.",Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, I think a 60/40 split is fairer considering the inflation risk. It gives you a good share while also accounting for the potential loss in value for both of us. Let's agree on this and avoid further rounds.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Bob, I understand your position, but since I face 20% inflation per round compared to your 10%, a 50/50 split is the fairest option. We both lose value by continuing to negotiate, but I lose more each round. Let's agree to this even split and conclude our negotiation efficiently.",Alice,3,
