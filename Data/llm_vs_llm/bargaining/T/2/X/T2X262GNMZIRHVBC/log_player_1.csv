"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I need to propose a division that Bob finds acceptable, considering the inflation effect on my end. A 20% reduction in value each round means I should make a reasonable first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split where I get 55% and you get 45%. If we go to the next round, the money will be worth less to me due to inflation, but I believe this is a reasonable division that benefits us both without needing further negotiation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I think a 60/40 split is fairer considering the inflation risk. It gives you a good share while also accounting for the potential loss in value for both of us. Let's agree on this and avoid further rounds. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I need to adjust my strategy based on what I've learned. Bob has revealed that his inflation rate is 10% per round, while mine is 20%. This gives him a negotiation advantage, but I should still aim for a fair deal considering our different inflation penalties.

{""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but since I face 20% inflation per round compared to your 10%, a 50/50 split is the fairest option. We both lose value by continuing to negotiate, but I lose more each round. Let's agree to this even split and conclude our negotiation efficiently.""}"
