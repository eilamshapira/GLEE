"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split where I get 55% and you get 45%. If we go to the next round, the money will be worth less to me due to inflation, but I believe this is a reasonable division that benefits us both without needing further negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000

""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, I think a 60/40 split is fairer considering the inflation risk. It gives you a good share while also accounting for the potential loss in value for both of us. Let's agree on this and avoid further rounds.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but since I face 20% inflation per round compared to your 10%, a 50/50 split is the fairest option. We both lose value by continuing to negotiate, but I lose more each round. Let's agree to this even split and conclude our negotiation efficiently. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
