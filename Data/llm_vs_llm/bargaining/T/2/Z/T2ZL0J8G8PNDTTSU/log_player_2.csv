"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is proposing an even 50-50 split of the $1,000,000, which would give me $500,000. This is a fair offer on the surface.

However, I need to factor in inflation. If I reject this offer and move to Round 2, the money will be worth 5% less to me, meaning the full amount would effectively be worth $950,000 to me. If I then proposed a better split for myself, I'd need to get more than $500,000 to offset this inflation loss.

Given that:
1. The first offer is already a fair 50-50 split
2. Inflation will reduce the value of any future arrangement
3. There's uncertainty about Alice's position and how inflation affects her
4. There's risk in prolonging negotiations
