"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to make a fair offer to Bob that considers both our interests, keeping in mind that money devalues faster for Bob than for me.

Let me think about this strategically. If Bob rejects my offer, he can make his own proposal next round, but the total value will be worth less to him (10% less) and slightly less to me (5% less). This gives me some leverage, but I still want to be fair.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I believe this is a reasonable first offer that acknowledges the different inflation rates we face. Since Bob's money devalues faster (10% per round versus my 5%), he has more incentive to accept now rather than wait. My proposal gives him a substantial portion while still being advantageous to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's equal split offer. While I initially proposed taking slightly more, Bob's 50-50 split is fair, and accepting now is rational because:

1. If I reject and we go to round 3, the money will be worth even less to both of us
2. Bob would face 10% more inflation in the next round versus my 5%, giving him incentive to make a reasonable offer now
3. A 50-50 split is conventionally fair and gives me half the money with only a 5% inflation penalty from the original value"
