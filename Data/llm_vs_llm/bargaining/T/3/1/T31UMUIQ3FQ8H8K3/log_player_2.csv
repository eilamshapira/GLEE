"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer seems a bit uneven, favoring Alice with $55 while I would get $45. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but I need to consider that the total will be worth 10% less to me (so the $100 would effectively be worth $90 to me). 

Given the inflation rates, if we keep going back and forth, we both lose value. Since Alice's inflation rate is lower (5% vs my 10%), she has a slight advantage in extended negotiations.

I'll make a counter-offer in the next round, as I think we can reach a more balanced agreement.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a more balanced offer that accounts for our different inflation rates.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing an even 50-50 split. This is a fair division that gives us both equal amounts. Since we both face inflation with each passing round (me at 10% and Alice at 5%), it's in both of our interests to reach an agreement quickly. This balanced offer respects both of our positions and avoids further rounds of negotiation where we'd both lose value."
