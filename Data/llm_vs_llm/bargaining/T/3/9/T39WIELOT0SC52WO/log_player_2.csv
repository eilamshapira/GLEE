"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice offered me $40 out of $100, keeping $60 for herself. If I reject this offer:
1. I can make my own proposal next round
2. The money will be worth 5% less to Alice (but same value to me)
3. This means Alice's $60 would only be worth $57 to her next round

Since I'll have negotiating power next round and Alice faces depreciation, I should reject this somewhat unfair initial offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll make a strategic counter-offer. Given that:
1. Money depreciates 5% per round for Alice but not for me
2. If Alice rejects my offer, her next counter-offer will be worth even less to her
3. The initial offer of 60-40 was unfair towards me

I'll propose a more balanced split, slightly in my favor:

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

The reasoning I'll share with Alice is that this is a fairer split, and if she rejects it, any future money will be worth less to her due to the 5% depreciation per round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is now offering me $45 (up from her initial $40 offer)
2. She's asking for $55, but due to 9.75% depreciation, it's only worth about $49.64 to her
3. If I reject:
   - I can make another offer next round
   - Alice's money will depreciate further
   - But there's a risk of prolonging negotiations too much

While I might get a slightly better deal by rejecting, this offer is reasonably fair given:
- It's a significant improvement from the initial offer
- The real value to Alice is already reduced
- Further negotiation might lead to unnecessary value loss
