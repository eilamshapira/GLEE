"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The current offer is $5,000 for me
2. If I reject and propose in the next round, my money will be worth 5% less
3. Even if I propose a more favorable split next round, I'll only get 95% of that value
4. For example, if I proposed a 6000/4000 split next round, I'd actually get $5,700 (95% of 6000)
5. The current 50/50 split is fair and I avoid the inflation penalty

Given this analysis, the even split is actually a good offer. If I reject, I risk getting less value due to inflation, and Alice might reject my next proposal anyway.
