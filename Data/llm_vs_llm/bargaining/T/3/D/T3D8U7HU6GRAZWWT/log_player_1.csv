"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let me make a fair initial offer, considering that waiting is more costly for me (10% loss per round) than for Bob (5% loss per round).

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose this split because it's slightly in my favor but still reasonable enough that Bob might accept it rather than wait for the next round where our total value would decrease."
