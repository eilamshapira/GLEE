"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. Alice is offering me $45 while she takes $55. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but the total money will be worth 5% less to me, meaning the $100 would be equivalent to $95. 

For Alice, the money devalues faster (10% per round), so the $100 would be worth only $90 to her in the next round.

If I reject, I could potentially propose a better split for myself. However, the devaluation also means I need to consider that we might lose more in total value with further negotiation.

Given the relatively fair initial offer and the risk of devaluation, I'll respond:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
