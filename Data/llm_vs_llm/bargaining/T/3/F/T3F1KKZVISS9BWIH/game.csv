5500.0,4500.0,Let's start with a fair split considering the inflation affects me more. This offer gives you a good amount while acknowledging my higher inflation rate.,Alice,1,

5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, I understand your point about inflation rates, but I think a 50-50 split is the fairest starting point. With your 20% inflation rate, you're more incentivized to reach an agreement quickly, while my 5% rate gives me more patience. This even split recognizes both our positions. If we delay further, we'll both lose value, especially you.",Bob,2,

5800.0,4200.0,"Bob, I understand your perspective, but with my higher inflation rate, I need to secure a bit more. This offer still gives you a substantial amount while helping me mitigate the effects of inflation.",Alice,3,

4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, I notice you're asking for more than in round 1 despite your 36% inflation already affecting you significantly. With each round, your money loses value 4x faster than mine (20% vs 5%), greatly strengthening my position. This 55-45 split in my favor acknowledges this reality while still giving you substantial value. Further delays will only hurt your position more dramatically than mine. Let's conclude this now before inflation further reduces our total.",Bob,4,
