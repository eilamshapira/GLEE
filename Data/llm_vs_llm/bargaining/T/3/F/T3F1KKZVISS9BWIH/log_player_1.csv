Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your point about inflation rates, but I think a 50-50 split is the fairest starting point. With your 20% inflation rate, you're more incentivized to reach an agreement quickly, while my 5% rate gives me more patience. This even split recognizes both our positions. If we delay further, we'll both lose value, especially you. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I notice you're asking for more than in round 1 despite your 36% inflation already affecting you significantly. With each round, your money loses value 4x faster than mine (20% vs 5%), greatly strengthening my position. This 55-45 split in my favor acknowledges this reality while still giving you substantial value. Further delays will only hurt your position more dramatically than mine. Let's conclude this now before inflation further reduces our total. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500
