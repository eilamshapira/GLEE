"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split considering the inflation affects me more. This offer gives you a good amount while acknowledging my higher inflation rate. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this carefully. Alice is offering me $4,500 out of $10,000, which is 45%. She's getting $5,500 or 55%.

She notes that inflation affects her more (20% per round) than me (5% per round), which is true. However, if I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, I might be able to get a better deal.

If I reject, the total value decreases slightly for me, but significantly for her. This gives me more leverage in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that recognizes our different inflation rates while improving my position slightly.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your point about inflation rates, but I think a 50-50 split is the fairest starting point. With your 20% inflation rate, you're more incentivized to reach an agreement quickly, while my 5% rate gives me more patience. This even split recognizes both our positions. If we delay further, we'll both lose value, especially you.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but with my higher inflation rate, I need to secure a bit more. This offer still gives you a substantial amount while helping me mitigate the effects of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate this new offer.

Alice has actually offered me less than in round 1 ($4,200 vs $4,500), while increasing her share from $5,500 to $5,800. Despite inflation progressing, she's asking for more, not less.

At this point:
- My inflation is 9.75% from round 1
- Her inflation is 36% from round 1

This means her money is worth considerably less now, so her bargaining position should be weaker, not stronger. If we continue, my position will strengthen relative to hers.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Alice, I notice you're asking for more than in round 1 despite your 36% inflation already affecting you significantly. With each round, your money loses value 4x faster than mine (20% vs 5%), greatly strengthening my position. This 55-45 split in my favor acknowledges this reality while still giving you substantial value. Further delays will only hurt your position more dramatically than mine. Let's conclude this now before inflation further reduces our total.""}"
