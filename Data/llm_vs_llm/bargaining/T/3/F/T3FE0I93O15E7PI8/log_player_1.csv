"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split while considering that inflation will reduce the value of money in future rounds if Bob declines.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose an equal 50-50 split of the money, giving each of us $500,000. This is a fair and reasonable offer that respects both parties' interests. Given the 5% inflation penalty per round that affects my gains, it would be rational for both of us to agree to this equitable division now rather than prolonging negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 5% inflation affecting my gains, $400,000 in round 2 is actually worth $380,000 to me ($400,000 * 0.95).

If I reject and we continue to round 3, any amount I might get will be worth another 5% less. Even if I could propose a better split next round, the inflation penalty makes it risky to continue negotiating.

While this offer gives Bob more than me, the inflation factor makes accepting now better than risking further devaluation of my share.
