600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, to beat the inflation penalty on my share, I propose we settle immediately. I offer you $400000 and keep $600000 for myself from the $1000000. This ensures we both secure real value todayâ€”waiting may cost us both in real terms. Looking forward to your agreement!",Alice,1,

500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I think a fair split would be more appropriate. Let's divide the money equally to ensure we both get a fair share. This way, we can both walk away with $500000 each. I'm sure you'll agree that inflation is a risk but let's not let it dictate an unfair division.",Bob,2,
