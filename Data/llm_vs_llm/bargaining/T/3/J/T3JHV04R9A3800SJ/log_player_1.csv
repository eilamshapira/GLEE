"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, to beat the inflation penalty on my share, I propose we settle immediately. I offer you $400,000 and keep $600,000 for myself from the $1,000,000. This ensures we both secure real value todayâ€”waiting may cost us both in real terms. Looking forward to your agreement!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I think a fair split would be more appropriate. Let's divide the money equally to ensure we both get a fair share. This way, we can both walk away with $500000 each. I'm sure you'll agree that inflation is a risk but let's not let it dictate an unfair division. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
