"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to beat the inflation penalty on my share, I propose we settle immediately. I offer you $400000 and keep $600000 for myself from the $1000000. This ensures we both secure real value todayâ€”waiting may cost us both in real terms. Looking forward to your agreement! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I think a fair split would be more appropriate. Let's divide the money equally to ensure we both get a fair share. This way, we can both walk away with $500,000 each. I'm sure you'll agree that inflation is a risk but let's not let it dictate an unfair division.""}"
