"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze the offer in Round 2.

*   **My perspective (Alice):** I'm offered $30. However, due to inflation, this is worth only 80% of its original value to me.
*   **Bob's perspective:** Bob is offered $70, which is worth 100% of its original value.

My current ""worth"" of 1$ is 0.8$.
The offer in the current round gives me 30 * 0.8 = 24$.

Considering the fact that I can make an offer in the next round, and the inflation will keep decreasing the money value for me.
I will **reject** this offer.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 3. Remember, I'm dealing with further inflation. The value of the money I gain is now worth 20% less than it was in round 2.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```"
