"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me $40 while keeping $60 for herself. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, and due to the 20% inflation penalty for Alice (but not for me), her $60 would only be worth $48 to her in the next round.

This means I have leverage to negotiate a better deal, as any delay hurts Alice more than it hurts me. I should reject this offer and propose a more favorable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I can now make my own proposal. Given that:
1. Any further delay will cost Alice 20% in value, while I'm not affected by inflation
2. Alice needs to think rationally about accepting my offer versus making a counter-offer that would be worth even less to her

I'll propose a split that gives me a larger share while still being reasonable enough for Alice to accept rather than risk further devaluation.

{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30}

I propose this split because if Alice rejects it, her next-round dollars will be worth 20% less, making her $30 now more valuable than a potentially better split in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is offering a 50-50 split
2. For Alice, her $50 is actually only worth $32 (due to 36% inflation)
3. For me, the $50 is still worth full value
4. If I reject, in the next round Alice's money will be worth even less (about 49% less than original value)

While I could reject and try to get an even better deal in the next round, a $50 gain for me is quite reasonable, and there's always a risk of the negotiation breaking down if we keep going. Given that I'm already benefiting from the inflation effect on Alice's side, this seems like a fair deal.
