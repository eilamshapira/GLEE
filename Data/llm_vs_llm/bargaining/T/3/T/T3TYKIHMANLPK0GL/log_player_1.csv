"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split while accounting for the fact that Bob could counter-offer, but that would reduce the total value by 5%.

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}

I propose I get $52 and Bob gets $48. This is close to equal but slightly in my favor since I'm making the first move. If Bob rejects, we'll both be dealing with less money in the next round due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer:
1. Bob wants $55 for himself and offers me $45
2. Due to 5% inflation, my $45 is actually worth $42.75
3. If I reject, the next round will have another 5% inflation
4. I could counter-offer, but we'd both lose more value
5. While this isn't ideal, reaching an agreement sooner is better than letting inflation eat away at the total value
