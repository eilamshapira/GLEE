55.0,45.0,"I understand your concern about inflation affecting your value. However, you asked for quite a bit more in your favor. Let's be more balanced - I'm offering you $45 which is worth more to you now than waiting another round when inflation will reduce its value further. This is a fair compromise.",Alice,3,
