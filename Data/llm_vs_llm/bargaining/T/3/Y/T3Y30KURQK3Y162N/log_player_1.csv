"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob for the first round.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""I suggest a fair split of $50 each. Since inflation doesn't affect me, I'm happy with an equal division that benefits us both equally.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: How about a 60/40 split in my favor?  It's important to act fast as the value decreases with each round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I understand your concern about inflation affecting your value. However, you asked for quite a bit more in your favor. Let's be more balanced - I'm offering you $45 which is worth more to you now than waiting another round when inflation will reduce its value further. This is a fair compromise.""
