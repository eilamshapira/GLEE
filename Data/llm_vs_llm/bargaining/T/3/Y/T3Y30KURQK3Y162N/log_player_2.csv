"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a fair split of $50 each. Since inflation doesn't affect me, I'm happy with an equal division that benefits us both equally. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""How about a 60/40 split in my favor?  It's important to act fast as the value decreases with each round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concern about inflation affecting your value. However, you asked for quite a bit more in your favor. Let's be more balanced - I'm offering you $45 which is worth more to you now than waiting another round when inflation will reduce its value further. This is a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
