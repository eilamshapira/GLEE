Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to be fair, but considering the inflation affects you more than me, I think it's fair for me to get a bit more. I'm willing to settle at 5500 for me and 4500 for you. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
