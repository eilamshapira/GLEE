Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a fair offer to Bob, considering the inflation rates.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, 
""bob_gain"": 4800, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a slightly higher amount for myself since your inflation rate is higher (10% vs my 5%), which means you have more incentive to reach an agreement sooner. This is a fair division that recognizes our different time preferences.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your point about the inflation rates. How about we meet closer to the middle? This offer still gives you a slight edge while being more agreeable for me. 
# Alice gain: 5100 
# Bob gain: 4900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
