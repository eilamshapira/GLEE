"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering a slightly higher amount for myself since your inflation rate is higher (10% vs my 5%), which means you have more incentive to reach an agreement sooner. This is a fair division that recognizes our different time preferences. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
