Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, let's be fair.  I think 55-45 in my favor is a good starting point since you took the lead last round.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{
