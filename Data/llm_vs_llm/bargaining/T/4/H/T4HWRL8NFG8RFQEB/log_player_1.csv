"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I'm Alice, and I need to make an offer to Bob, keeping in mind the inflation that affects me. I also need to consider that if we don't reach an agreement within 12 rounds, we both get nothing.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

Rationale:

*   I'm offering Bob a significant portion (40%) to increase the likelihood of him accepting the offer in this early round.
*   I'm prioritizing getting a deal done early to mitigate the impact of inflation on my gains. While 60% might seem greedy, I need to account for the fact that the value of the money will decrease rapidly in the coming rounds if we don't agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I see Bob's counteroffer. Let's analyze this.

*   **Bob's offer:** Bob is proposing a 50/50 split.
*   **Inflation:** My money is now worth 10% less than in round 1. So, $5000 in this round is equivalent to $4500 in round 1 terms for me.
*   **Strategic Considerations:** We are in round 2. If I reject, inflation will continue to eat away at my potential gains.

Decision: Given the inflation and the fact that Bob is offering a 50/50 split, I will accept.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
