"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's offer considering the total amount to divide and potential future rounds.

Alice is offering me $4,000 out of the $10,000, which is 40% of the total. While this isn't an even split, it's a substantial amount. Since there's no inflation for me, I don't lose value by continuing to negotiate, but there's also the risk of ending up with nothing if we reach 12 rounds without agreement.

I think I can negotiate for a more favorable split.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more balanced while still acknowledging Alice's initial position.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an even 50-50 split, which I believe is fair for both of us. This gives us each $5,000, representing an equal division of the total amount."
