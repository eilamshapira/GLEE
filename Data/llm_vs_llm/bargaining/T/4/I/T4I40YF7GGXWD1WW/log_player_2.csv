"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split is fair and benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $400,000 out of $1,000,000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but:
   - The money will be worth 10% less to me
   - $400,000 now is better than $440,000 next round (due to 10% inflation)
3. The offer is reasonable, though not perfectly equal
4. There's risk in rejecting as future negotiations might lead to worse outcomes

While I could try to negotiate for more, the inflation penalty makes accepting this offer the safer choice. $400,000 now is a substantial amount, and the risk of getting less due to inflation or failed negotiations outweighs the potential benefit of a better split.
