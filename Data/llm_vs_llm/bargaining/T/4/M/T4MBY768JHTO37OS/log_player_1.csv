# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your emphasis on fairness. However, to prevent further loss of value on my end due to inflation and to expedite our agreement for both our benefits, I propose a split of $45 for me and $55 for you. I believe this strike a fair balance given the uncertain inflation risks. Letâ€™s settle now before we lose more value.
