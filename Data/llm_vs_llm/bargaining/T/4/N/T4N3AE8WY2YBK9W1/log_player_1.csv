"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll offer a split that accounts for the different inflation rates we face. Since Bob's money loses value faster (20% per round) compared to my 5% loss, I should propose a reasonable split that encourages early acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

This is a fair 60-40 split that gives Bob a substantial portion while acknowledging my slightly stronger negotiating position due to the inflation rates. I believe this is generous enough for Bob to seriously consider accepting rather than risking greater value loss in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Due to inflation, if I accept:
   * My $450,000 is worth 95% of original value = $427,500 effective value
   * Bob's $550,000 is worth 80% of original value = $440,000 effective value

2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make a new offer
   * But values will decrease further (my 5%, Bob's 20%)
   * We have 10 rounds left

Given that:
- This is still a relatively fair split considering present values
- Bob's money is devaluing much faster than mine (20% vs 5%)
- Dragging this out hurts both of us, but hurts Bob more
- We need to reach agreement within 12 rounds

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept this offer because it's reasonably fair in present value terms, and the risk of further devaluation through continued negotiation outweighs the potential benefit of holding out for a better deal."
