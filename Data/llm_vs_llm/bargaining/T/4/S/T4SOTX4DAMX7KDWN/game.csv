600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, let's keep this simple and fair. I propose $600000 for me and $400000 for you, since I'm starting the negotiation. What do you think?",Alice,1,

500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. Since we're both rational players and I'm facing 20% inflation per round, I propose an even 50-50 split. This is fair for both of us, and accepting now maximizes our total utility before further inflation affects the value. Let's finish this efficiently.",Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I understand the inflation impacts both of us, but I've adjusted my previous offer slightly to account for our different inflation rates. Let's settle this at $550000 for me and $450000 for you. Given the current circumstances, I believe this is reasonable for maximizing both our values.",Alice,3,
