"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. Since we're both rational players and I'm facing 20% inflation per round, I propose an even 50-50 split. This is fair for both of us, and accepting now maximizes our total utility before further inflation affects the value. Let's finish this efficiently. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
