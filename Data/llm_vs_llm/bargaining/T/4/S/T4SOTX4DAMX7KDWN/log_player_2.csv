"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's keep this simple and fair. I propose $600000 for me and $400000 for you, since I'm starting the negotiation. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer carefully considering the 20% inflation per round. If I reject, I'll make a counter-offer next round, but the total value will be worth 20% less to me.

Current offer: I get $400,000
If I reject and go to next round: The $1,000,000 pot would be worth only $800,000 to me due to 20% inflation.

Since this initial offer gives me 40% of the total, and rejecting would immediately reduce the value of any counter-offer, this isn't a bad starting position.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that acknowledges the inflation factor while trying to improve my position slightly.

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. Since we're both rational players and I'm facing 20% inflation per round, I propose an even 50-50 split. This is fair for both of us, and accepting now maximizes our total utility before further inflation affects the value. Let's finish this efficiently.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand the inflation impacts both of us, but I've adjusted my previous offer slightly to account for our different inflation rates. Let's settle this at $550000 for me and $450000 for you. Given the current circumstances, I believe this is reasonable for maximizing both our values. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate this offer considering the increasing inflation effect.

Current offer: I get $450,000, which with 36% inflation from round 1 is worth $450,000 Ã— 0.64 = $288,000 in round 1 value.

If I reject and go to round 4, I'll face even more inflation (likely around 50% from round 1), which would significantly decrease the value of any counter-offer I make.

Alice has improved her offer from $400,000 to $450,000 for me, which is a reasonable concession. Considering the compounding inflation effect, continuing to negotiate is likely to hurt my final outcome more than accepting this improved offer.
