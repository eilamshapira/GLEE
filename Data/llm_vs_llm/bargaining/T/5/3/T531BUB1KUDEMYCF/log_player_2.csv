"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a fair split: $500000 for you and $500000 for me. Let's settle this quickly and avoid any complications with inflation. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer gives me $500,000
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
   * The money will be worth 20% less for me
   * Maximum I could get would be $1,000,000 Ã— 0.8 = $800,000
   * But Alice might reject that, leading to further rounds and more inflation

$500,000 is a fair split, and considering the risk of inflation in future rounds, this is actually a good offer. If I reject, I might end up with less due to inflation, even if I manage to negotiate a larger share.
