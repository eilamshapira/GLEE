"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 4800, ""bob_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'd like to settle this early. I propose that you receive $5,200 and I take $4,800. Settling now avoids the 20% devaluation for me in later rounds and guarantees both of us a clear, immediate benefit. Let me know if you accept this fair division.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to settle early. However, considering the inflation factor, I think a slight adjustment is fair. I propose I take $5500 and you take $4500. This still gives you a significant amount and helps mitigate the devaluation risk for me. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. Even though the inflation impacts my share, I value the certainty of receiving a substantial amount now compared to risking further devaluation in later rounds. I accept your proposal.""}"
