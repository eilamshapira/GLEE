"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'd like to settle this early. I propose that you receive $5200 and I take $4800. Settling now avoids the 20% devaluation for me in later rounds and guarantees both of us a clear, immediate benefit. Let me know if you accept this fair division. 
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to settle early. However, considering the inflation factor, I think a slight adjustment is fair. I propose I take $5500 and you take $4500. This still gives you a significant amount and helps mitigate the devaluation risk for me.""}"
