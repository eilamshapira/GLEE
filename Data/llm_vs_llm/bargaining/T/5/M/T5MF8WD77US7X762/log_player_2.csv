"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a counter-offer in the next round. 10$ is too low for me, especially considering that any delay will reduce the value due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, considering that the inflation rate affects me more severely (20% vs 10% per round). This is still a fair offer that leaves Alice with a substantial amount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

20$ with a 36% reduction in value is too low. I'll make a more balanced counter-offer in the next round, but we need to reach an agreement soon as the inflation is hurting both of us, especially me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'm slightly lowering my demand to 55$ to show willingness to compromise, while still accounting for my higher inflation rate. We should reach an agreement soon as the money is losing value quickly for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

25$ with a 59.04% reduction in value is still too low - it would only be worth about 10.24$ in original value. We need to reach a more balanced agreement quickly, as the inflation is severely impacting both of us. I'll make a more compromising offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I'm now proposing a completely equal 50-50 split. Given the severe inflation impact on both of us (though worse for me), this is a fair compromise that should allow us to conclude the negotiation. Neither of us benefits from further delays."
