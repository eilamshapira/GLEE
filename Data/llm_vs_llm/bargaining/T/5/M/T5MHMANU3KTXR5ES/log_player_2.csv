"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Since Alice faces a 5% depreciation per round while I face no depreciation, I have a stronger negotiating position. If I reject this offer:

1. Next round I can make a proposal
2. For Alice, any future amount will be worth 5% less
3. This creates pressure on Alice to accept a less favorable deal

The current offer is a 50-50 split, but given my stronger position, I can likely get a better deal by rejecting and making a counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I have a stronger negotiating position due to Alice's 5% depreciation per round, I'll propose a split that's more favorable to me but still reasonable enough that Alice should accept rather than risk further depreciation.

If Alice rejects this offer, in the next round the money will be worth 10% less to her, significantly weakening her position.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I propose this 60-40 split because:
1. It's better than a 50-50 split for me
2. For Alice, $400,000 now is better than risking further rounds where her purchasing power decreases
3. It's not so extreme that it would appear unfair or hostile"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice has increased her offer to me from the initial 500,000 to 550,000
2. However, I'm still in a strong position because:
   - Alice faces continued depreciation (will be ~15% next round)
   - I can make the next offer if I reject
   - The money maintains full value for me

3. Given that Alice already rejected my 600,000/400,000 split, and her money is worth less now, she might be more willing to accept an even better offer for me in the next round.

4. The difference between this offer (550,000) and what I proposed last round (600,000) is significant enough to justify another round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given the current situation:
1. The money has already depreciated by ~10% for Alice
2. If she rejects this offer, it will depreciate by ~15% in the next round
3. She's shown willingness to offer me 550,000
4. She's in a weaker position now than when she rejected my 600,000/400,000 split

I'll propose a more aggressive split that reflects my stronger negotiating position:

{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000}

This 65-35 split should be compelling for Alice because:
1. Further delays will cost her significantly due to depreciation
2. She's already shown movement toward accepting a less equal split
3. $350,000 now is worth more to her than potentially getting slightly more in future rounds with 15%+ depreciation"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has now offered me 600,000, which is a significant improvement from her initial 500,000 offer
2. This matches what I initially proposed in round 2
3. The money has already depreciated by 18.55% for Alice
4. If I reject, the next round will have Alice's money worth about 23% less
5. While I could potentially get more by continuing, we're reaching a point where:
   - The negotiations might become too hostile
   - Alice's depreciation is becoming severe, which might make her more desperate but also less rational
   - I've achieved a significant improvement from the initial 50-50 split

Given these factors, and that I've achieved a 60-40 split which was my initial target, I'll accept this offer.
