"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split that accounts for potential future inflation if Bob declines.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

Let me explain my offer to Bob: I propose I get $550,000 and you get $450,000. This is a reasonable split that gives us both substantial gains, and accepting now means we both avoid inflation losses."
