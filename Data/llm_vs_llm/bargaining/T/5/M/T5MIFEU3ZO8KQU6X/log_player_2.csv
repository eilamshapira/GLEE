"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $450,000 out of the $1,000,000, while she takes $550,000. If I reject this offer, I can make a counter-proposal in the next round, but I need to account for the 5% inflation penalty that will affect my share.

If I reject, the total value to me in the next round would be $950,000 (5% less than $1,000,000). This means even if I propose to take all the money in round 2, it would only be worth $950,000 to me.

Since Alice's current offer gives me $450,000, which is quite substantial and nearly half of the money, I'll accept it rather than risk making a counter-offer that might be rejected.
