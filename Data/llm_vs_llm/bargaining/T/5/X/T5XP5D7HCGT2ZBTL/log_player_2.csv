"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is proposing I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, the money will be worth 5% less next round
4. 5% of $10,000 means we'd lose $500 in total value
5. A 50-50 split would be $5,000 each
6. This offer gives me $1,000 less than a 50-50 split
7. If I reject, the next round will have $9,500 total value

I think I should reject this offer. Even with the 5% inflation penalty, I can propose a more favorable split next round that could still give both of us a better outcome.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me propose a more balanced split, but still giving Alice a slight advantage to increase chances of acceptance:

{""bob_gain"": 4750,
""alice_gain"": 5250,
""message"": ""A more balanced split that's still favorable to you. Remember, rejecting will cost us both money due to inflation.""}

This offer is strategic because:
1. It's closer to a 50-50 split, which feels fair
2. I'm still giving Alice slightly more ($500 more) to show goodwill
3. I'm reminding her about the inflation penalty to encourage acceptance
4. Even with a 5% loss next round, it would be hard for her to get a much better deal that I would accept"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer, slightly better for you 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is now offering me $4,200 (up from $4,000 in round 1)
2. Due to 9.75% inflation, $4,200 is now worth about $3,791 in round 1 value
3. If I reject, next round will have another 5% inflation (total 14.75% from original)
4. We're both losing value with each round
5. The improvement in my share ($200) doesn't compensate for the inflation loss
6. If I reject, I risk further value deterioration and might end up with less

While this isn't the ideal split I wanted, continuing to negotiate is likely to result in worse outcomes for both of us due to mounting inflation. It's better to accept this offer now than risk further value loss.
