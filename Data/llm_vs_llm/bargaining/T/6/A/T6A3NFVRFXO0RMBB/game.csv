6000.0,4000.0,Let's split it fairly with a slight advantage to me. What do you think?,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
5000.0,5000.0,I propose a completely fair 50-50 split. This way we both benefit equally and can end the negotiation amicably.,Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,How about a slight adjustment? I get 5500 and you get 4500. It's still close to fair.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5000.0,5000.0,I'm maintaining my position for a 50-50 split. There's no rational reason why either of us should get more than the other. This is the fairest solution.,Bob,4,
