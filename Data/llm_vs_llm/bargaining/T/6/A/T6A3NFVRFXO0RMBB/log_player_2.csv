"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly with a slight advantage to me. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I think we can achieve a more equitable split. Since this is just the first round and we have 11 more rounds to negotiate, I'll make a counter-proposal in the next round that's fairer to both parties."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""I propose a completely fair 50-50 split. This way we both benefit equally and can end the negotiation amicably.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: How about a slight adjustment? I get 5500 and you get 4500. It's still close to fair. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll stick to pursuing a fair 50-50 split since there's no compelling reason for either of us to receive more than the other. We still have plenty of rounds to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
