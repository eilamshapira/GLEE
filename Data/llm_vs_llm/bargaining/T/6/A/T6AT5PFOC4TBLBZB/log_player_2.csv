"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
* Alice is offering me 4000$ (40%) while keeping 6000$ (60%)
* If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
* However, due to 10% inflation, the total pot will be worth 9000$ next round
* Even with a better split next round, I might end up with less in absolute terms
* 4000$ is still a significant amount

While I could try to negotiate for more, the inflation penalty makes this a risky strategy. Given that this is a reasonable first offer and I want to secure a good amount, I'll accept.
