"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Alice is offering a 50-50 split, which might seem fair at first glance. However, I need to consider that:
1. With each round that passes, my share loses 5% value
2. I'll have a chance to make a counter-offer in the next round
3. Alice's money doesn't lose value over time

While 5000$ is a substantial amount, I can propose a better split in the next round to account for the inflation penalty I'm facing. Even with the 5% loss on my next turn, I might be able to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I'm facing a 5% penalty per round and Alice isn't, I should propose a split that slightly favors me to compensate for this disadvantage. However, I don't want to be too aggressive as Alice might reject and the subsequent inflation would hurt my position.

My $5000 from the previous offer would now be worth $4750 due to 5% inflation. To make up for this disadvantage and the risk of future rounds, I'll propose a 60-40 split in my favor.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

I propose this split considering that:
1. It compensates for my inflation penalty
2. It's not so extreme that Alice would certainly reject it
3. If Alice rejects, my next potential gain would be subject to another 5% loss"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. The $4500 offered to me is actually worth $4063.75 (due to 9.75% inflation)
2. Alice's proposed split is worse for me than her initial 50-50 offer
3. If I reject, my next proposal would face a 14.75% inflation penalty
4. We still have 9 rounds left, but continuing to reject offers will significantly diminish my potential gains

While I could reject and propose a higher split for myself, the increasing inflation penalty makes this risky. The $4063.75 real value I'd get now is still better than risking further rounds with higher inflation.
