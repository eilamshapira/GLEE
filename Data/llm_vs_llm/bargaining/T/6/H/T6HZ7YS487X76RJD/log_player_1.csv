"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to make a strategic offer considering the inflation rates for both of us. Since my inflation rate (20%) is higher than Bob's (5%), I should aim to reach an agreement sooner rather than later.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I think this is a fair starting offer that gives me a slight advantage while still being attractive enough for Bob to potentially accept. The 55/45 split acknowledges that I need to secure more now due to my higher inflation rate, but I'm not being overly greedy which could lead to rejection and a costlier negotiation for me in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this carefully. Because of inflation, the money is now worth less to both of us, but especially to me.

For me, $450,000 in round 2 is worth the same as $450,000 × 0.8 = $360,000 in round 1 values.
For Bob, $550,000 in round 2 is worth the same as $550,000 × 0.95 = $522,500 in round 1 values.

If I reject, we go to round 3 where I can make another offer, but my money will be worth another 20% less (64% of original value), while Bob's will only be worth 9.75% less (90.25% of original value).

Given the asymmetric inflation rates, delaying is much costlier to me than to Bob. If we continue to trade similar offers, I'll lose substantial value due to my higher inflation rate.
