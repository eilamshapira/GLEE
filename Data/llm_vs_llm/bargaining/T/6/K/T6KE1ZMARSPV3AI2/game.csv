5500.0,4500.0,"Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a slightly higher share for me because my inflation rate is higher (20% vs your 10%). If we drag this out, we both lose value faster. This is a fair first offer that recognizes our different positions.",Alice,1,

5000.0,5000.0,"Let's split it equally. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage. Even with the different inflation rates, this seems like a fair deal.",Bob,2,

5800.0,4200.0,"Bob, I had to reject your 50-50 split because our inflation rates are different. My money loses 20% value each round while yours only loses 10%. If we consider present value, my proposal is actually quite balanced. Let's reach an agreement now before both our shares lose more value.",Alice,3,

5500.0,4500.0,"I understand your concern about the inflation rates. Let's settle for the initial offer you proposed. This way, we can both walk away with a fair share before the money loses more value.",Bob,4,
