"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob that considers the asymmetric inflation rates while trying to be fair.

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a slightly higher share for me because my inflation rate is higher (20% vs your 10%). If we drag this out, we both lose value faster. This is a fair first offer that recognizes our different positions.""}"
