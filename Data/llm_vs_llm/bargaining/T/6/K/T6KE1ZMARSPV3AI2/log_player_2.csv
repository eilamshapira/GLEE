"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a slightly higher share for me because my inflation rate is higher (20% vs your 10%). If we drag this out, we both lose value faster. This is a fair first offer that recognizes our different positions. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's split it equally. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage. Even with the different inflation rates, this seems like a fair deal.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I had to reject your 50-50 split because our inflation rates are different. My money loses 20% value each round while yours only loses 10%. If we consider present value, my proposal is actually quite balanced. Let's reach an agreement now before both our shares lose more value. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4

""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""I understand your concern about the inflation rates. Let's settle for the initial offer you proposed. This way, we can both walk away with a fair share before the money loses more value.""}"
