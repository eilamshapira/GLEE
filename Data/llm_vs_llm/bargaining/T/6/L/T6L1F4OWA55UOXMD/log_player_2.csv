"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for herself.

If I reject and move to the next round:
- The total value decreases by 10% for me and 20% for Alice
- I can make my own proposal
- But Alice could still reject it, leading to further devaluation

Current offer for me: $400,000
Next round max potential (if Alice accepts): $900,000 Ã— 0.9 = $810,000

While I could potentially get more in the next round, there's risk involved:
1. Alice might reject my next offer
2. The money will be worth less
3. We could enter a cycle of rejections

Given the significant devaluation rates and the decent initial offer, I'll accept.
