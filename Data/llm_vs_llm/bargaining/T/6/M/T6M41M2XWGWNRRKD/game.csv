5500.0,4500.0,"Hi Bob, since I face a 10% inflation penalty each round while you don't, I'm proposing a slightly higher share for me. This is fair since delaying would cost me value but not you. If we go to round 2, my money is worth 10% less, so this split acknowledges that asymmetry while still giving you a substantial portion.",Alice,1,

5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your reasoning. However, to keep things simple and fair, I propose we split the amount equally. This way, we both walk away with an identical amount, acknowledging both our preferences.",Bob,2,

5700.0,4300.0,"Bob, I have to reject a 50-50 split because it's not actually equal for us. Due to the 10% inflation penalty I face each round, I need to account for that disadvantage. If we keep going back and forth, I lose more value while you don't. By round 3, I'm already facing a 20% inflation penalty. This 57-43 split acknowledges this asymmetry but still gives you a significant portion. Let's reach an agreement now rather than dragging this out further.",Alice,3,

5200.0,4800.0,"Alice, I understand the inflation challenge you're facing, so I'm offering you a bit more while still aiming for a resolution that's agreeable to both of us. I propose $5200 for you and $4800 for me. This gives you a larger share in recognition of your inflation risk, while also remaining fair from my perspective.",Bob,4,
