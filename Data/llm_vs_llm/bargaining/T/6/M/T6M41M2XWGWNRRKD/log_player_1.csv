"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a fair offer to Bob considering the inflation penalty I face.

{""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, since I face a 10% inflation penalty each round while you don't, I'm proposing a slightly higher share for me. This is fair since delaying would cost me value but not you. If we go to round 2, my money is worth 10% less, so this split acknowledges that asymmetry while still giving you a substantial portion.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your reasoning. However, to keep things simple and fair, I propose we split the amount equally. This way, we both walk away with an identical amount, acknowledging both our preferences. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5700,
""bob_gain"": 4300,
""message"": ""Bob, I have to reject a 50-50 split because it's not actually equal for us. Due to the 10% inflation penalty I face each round, I need to account for that disadvantage. If we keep going back and forth, I lose more value while you don't. By round 3, I'm already facing a 20% inflation penalty. This 57-43 split acknowledges this asymmetry but still gives you a significant portion. Let's reach an agreement now rather than dragging this out further.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the inflation challenge you're facing, so I'm offering you a bit more while still aiming for a resolution that's agreeable to both of us. I propose $5200 for you and $4800 for me. This gives you a larger share in recognition of your inflation risk, while also remaining fair from my perspective. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800
