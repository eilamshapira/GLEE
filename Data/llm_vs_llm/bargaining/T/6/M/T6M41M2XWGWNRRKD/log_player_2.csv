"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, since I face a 10% inflation penalty each round while you don't, I'm proposing a slightly higher share for me. This is fair since delaying would cost me value but not you. If we go to round 2, my money is worth 10% less, so this split acknowledges that asymmetry while still giving you a substantial portion. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your reasoning. However, to keep things simple and fair, I propose we split the amount equally. This way, we both walk away with an identical amount, acknowledging both our preferences.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have to reject a 50-50 split because it's not actually equal for us. Due to the 10% inflation penalty I face each round, I need to account for that disadvantage. If we keep going back and forth, I lose more value while you don't. By round 3, I'm already facing a 20% inflation penalty. This 57-43 split acknowledges this asymmetry but still gives you a significant portion. Let's reach an agreement now rather than dragging this out further. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand the inflation challenge you're facing, so I'm offering you a bit more while still aiming for a resolution that's agreeable to both of us. I propose $5,200 for you and $4,800 for me. This gives you a larger share in recognition of your inflation risk, while also remaining fair from my perspective.""}"
