"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to consider how to divide the $10,000 with Bob. Since I don't face any inflation penalty but Bob loses 5% value each round, I have some negotiating leverage. However, I should still make a reasonable first offer to avoid unnecessary rounds.

Here's my offer:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm offering a slightly better deal for myself, but still close to an even split. This gives Bob a fair amount while acknowledging my stronger position due to the inflation asymmetry."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Now that we've each rejected one offer, I should consider the inflation effects more carefully. Bob faces a 5% penalty per round, which means in this round, the money is worth 10% less to him than in round 1. I can use this to make a more strategic offer.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly compared to my first offer, knowing that Bob has incentive to reach an agreement soon due to his inflation penalty. This offer gives Bob $4,200, which is still a substantial amount but reflects my stronger negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I notice we're in a bit of a standoff with Bob. The inflation penalty for Bob is now significant - money is worth about 19% less to him than in round 1. I should leverage this to make an offer that's more favorable to me while still being acceptable enough that Bob won't want to continue with further rounds of inflation.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 6200, ""bob_gain"": 3800}
```

This offer takes into account Bob's weakening position due to inflation while still giving him a substantial portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","We're now in round 7, and Bob is facing approximately 26% inflation compared to round 1. His continued rejections suggest he's willing to accept significant inflation losses to get a better deal. I need to consider whether to continue increasing my demands or make a more compromising offer to reach an agreement.

Given the inflation pressure on Bob, I'll make a stronger offer for myself while still leaving him with a meaningful amount:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 6600, ""bob_gain"": 3400}
```

This offer reflects my stronger position due to the asymmetric inflation, but still gives Bob enough that accepting might be better than continuing to another round where he'll lose even more value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3800 
# Bob gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","We're now in round 9, and Bob is facing approximately 34% inflation compared to round 1. Despite this significant disadvantage, Bob seems committed to getting a larger share. I need to consider how to break this impasse.

Given that Bob keeps rejecting my offers despite his worsening position, I'll try a different approach with a slightly more generous offer that might be more acceptable to him:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 6300, ""bob_gain"": 3700}
```

This is actually a bit less for me than my previous offer. While I still maintain my advantage, this shows some willingness to compromise and might help us reach an agreement before further inflation makes the deal worse for Bob."
