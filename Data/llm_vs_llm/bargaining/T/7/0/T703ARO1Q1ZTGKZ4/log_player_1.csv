Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, taking into account the 5% inflation on my potential gains over the past two rounds (compounding to approximately a 9.75% loss), I need to adjust my offer to account for that perceived loss. Also, I need to make it more attractive to Bob to avoid further rounds of value decay.
