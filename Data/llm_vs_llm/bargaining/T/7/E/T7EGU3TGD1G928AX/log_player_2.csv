"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, $50 each seems fair to me. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer: Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which would give me $50 and Alice $50. This is a perfectly fair division that maximizes overall welfare equally between us.
