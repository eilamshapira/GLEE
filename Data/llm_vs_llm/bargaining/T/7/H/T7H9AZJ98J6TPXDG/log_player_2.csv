"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Current offer: $4000 for me, $6000 for Alice
2. If I reject and go to next round:
   - Money will be worth 20% less for me
   - Money will be worth 5% less for Alice
   - But I'll get to make the next proposal

The current split (40/60) isn't quite fair. Given that I have higher inflation pressure (20% vs 5%), waiting will cost me more. However, the split is too unfavorable to accept right away. In the next round, I can propose a more equitable division, and Alice would still get a decent amount even after her 5% inflation.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a strategic offer:

Since Alice's inflation rate (5%) is lower than mine (20%), she might be more willing to wait for a better deal. However, waiting still costs her money. I should propose a more balanced split that takes into account both our inflation rates.
