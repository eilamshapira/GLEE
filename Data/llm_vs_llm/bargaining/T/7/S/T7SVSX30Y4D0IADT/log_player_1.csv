"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a reasonable offer that gives me a good amount while being fair enough that Bob might accept, considering I need to account for the 20% inflation penalty if we go to the next round.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose taking $600,000 for myself and giving $400,000 to Bob. This is a 60-40 split which gives me a good portion while still being reasonable enough that Bob might accept rather than risk the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

If I accept Bob's offer:
- I get $450,000, but due to 20% inflation, it's worth $360,000 to me
- This is less than what I offered in round 1, but it's still a significant amount

If I reject and make a new offer in round 3:
- The money will be worth even less (another 20% reduction)
- Even if I proposed taking all the money, it would be worth only $640,000 to me (80% of 80% of 1,000,000)
- Bob would likely reject such an extreme offer anyway

Given these considerations, I should accept this offer. While not ideal, it's better than risking further inflation penalties.
