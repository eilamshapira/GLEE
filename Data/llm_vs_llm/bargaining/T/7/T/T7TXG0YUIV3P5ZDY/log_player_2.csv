"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. Keep in mind that with each round, the money is worth 10% less to me due to inflation, while it remains the same value for you. This means if we delay, we both lose value. This is a fair offer considering the declining value for me in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your situation with inflation, but I believe a 55-45 split in my favor is fair for this round. Given that the money's value decreases for you each round, this offer still leaves you with a good amount while acknowledging the urgency to settle. Let's agree on this and end the game.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. We're now in round 3, which means inflation has already reduced my value by about 20% cumulatively. If we keep going back and forth, we'll both lose out. This is a fair compromise from my initial offer that acknowledges your counter, while still accounting for my inflation disadvantage. Let's agree and finish the game now. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I see your point about inflation affecting you more each round. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a 50-50 split this time. This way, we both get an equal share, and we can end the game without further loss due to inflation. Let's settle on this and move forward.""
