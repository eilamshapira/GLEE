Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, consider that your money has already lost 40% of its value, while mine only lost 20%. If we continue, you'll lose even more. This $35 is worth more to you now than a higher number in the next round. Let's end this here. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65
