"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1. I'll aim for a fair split while considering the inflation factor that will affect me in later rounds.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Even though the offer is a straight 50/50 split, and I initially proposed more for myself, the 20% inflation on my potential earnings makes this a reasonable offer. I'll accept.
