"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get a substantial amount right away without risking inflation effects.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'd like to propose a fair 50-50 split. This gives us both equal shares while avoiding further rounds where my value decreases due to inflation. This is equitable for both of us, and I hope you'll agree so we can conclude this positively without further delay. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The reasoning for accepting:
1. Due to 10% inflation, if I reject, my next counter-offer would effectively be worth less
2. A 50-50 split is objectively fair
3. Getting $500,000 now is better than risking further rounds of inflation
4. Bob's reasoning is sound and shows willingness to cooperate
5. There's no guarantee I could get a better deal in future rounds given the inflation penalty"
