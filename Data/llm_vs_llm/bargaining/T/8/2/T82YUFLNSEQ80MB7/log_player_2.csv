"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get a substantial amount right away without risking inflation effects. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer of a 60-40 split. She would get $600,000 and I would get $400,000. If I reject and move to the next round, I'll face 10% inflation on my share.

If I make a counter-offer in round 2, the maximum I could effectively receive would be $900,000, but worth only $810,000 to me due to inflation. If negotiations extend further, my potential gains decrease with each round.

$400,000 now is better than potentially nothing if we reach round 12 without agreement. However, I believe I can negotiate for a more equitable split, especially since I'm the one facing certain inflation penalties.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split that acknowledges both our positions while considering the inflation pressure I'm facing.

{""bob_gain"": 500000,

""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'd like to propose a fair 50-50 split. This gives us both equal shares while avoiding further rounds where my value decreases due to inflation. This is equitable for both of us, and I hope you'll agree so we can conclude this positively without further delay.""}"
