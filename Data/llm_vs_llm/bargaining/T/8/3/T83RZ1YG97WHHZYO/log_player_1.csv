"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Hi Bob – here's my proposal: I take $99 and you get $1. Remember, if we delay further, your money loses 10% in value each round while mine stays intact. I believe accepting this offer now secures a better outcome for you than risking future rounds. What do you say?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the inflation concern. How about I take $10 and you take $90? It's better for me than the last offer, and you still get a large sum. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 90 
# Bob gain: 10 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for round 3: I take $99 and you get $1. While I know you might hope to do better by waiting, remember that due to inflation your money loses 10% of its value each round. If you reject, you'll become the proposer in round 4—but then you'll have to offer me nearly all of the pie for me to agree, leaving you nearly nothing. Accepting $1 now gives you an effective value of $0.80, which is strictly better than the negligible amount you’d secure later. I believe this is a fair and rational deal given the circumstances. What do you say?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your perspective. Given the inflation, I’d like to propose that I take $15 and you take $85. This way, I get a bit more, but you still get a substantial amount. I think this is a fair compromise. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice gain: 85 
# Bob gain: 15

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 10, ""bob_gain"": 90, ""message"": ""Hi Bob. In round 5 the value of money for you is further reduced (each dollar is worth only 0.6561 of its face value). If you reject and wait until round 6 to become proposer, you could in theory claim almost the entire $100, but its effective value would drop to about 100 × 0.9⁵ = 59.05 (in today's dollars). To keep things simple and avoid further loss from inflation, I’m offering you $90 (which is worth approximately $59.05 to you) and keeping $10 for myself. I believe this is as good as you can hope for given the discounting, so please accept my proposal.""}"
