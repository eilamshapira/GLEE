"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. I want to factor in the potential loss of value due to inflation for me. Let's start with a relatively generous offer to try and avoid further rounds.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. While 50/50 seems fair at face value, the inflation is hurting me. This round the value of the money for me is 90% of its initial value. Therefore, I need to adjust my decision-making.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, the clock is ticking and the value is eroding for me. Let's factor that in. This round, my gain is worth only 81% (90% of 90%) of the original value. Therefore, I need a bigger share to compensate. I will try to balance getting a good deal with making an offer Bob is likely to accept.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, 27.1% less value. This is becoming a losing proposition for me very quickly. While 45 seems low, rejecting will only further erode my potential gains. I will accept this offer.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
