"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get your money immediately without any inflation impact.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be more reasonable, a 55-45 split is more fair considering we're just starting out and have plenty of time to negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Rationale (not part of response): I'll reject because even with the 20% inflation, I can still aim for a better deal. My $4500 would be worth $3600 after inflation, which is significantly less than my initial offer. Since we have multiple rounds left, I can try to negotiate a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Bob, let's meet in the middle. A 55-45 split in my favor is fair considering I'm affected by inflation while you're not. Each round costs me 20% of value, so we should reach an agreement soon to maximize value for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation impact on your side, I'm being generous with a 60-40 split in my favor. It's in your best interest to accept this offer as the value for you will continue to decrease. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Rationale (not part of response): With 48.8% inflation, my $4000 would be worth about $2048. If I reject and continue negotiating, the inflation will keep reducing my value significantly. Given that Bob knows he's not affected by inflation, he's unlikely to offer better terms in future rounds. It's better to accept this offer now rather than risk getting even less value in later rounds."
