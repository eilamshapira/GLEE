"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to propose a split of the $10,000, keeping in mind the potential for inflation to affect my gains over time. Since this is round 1, I'll start with a relatively generous offer to Bob to increase the chances of acceptance and avoid future inflation losses.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob rejected my initial offer and now is proposing a split where he gets $5500 and I get $4500. I need to consider the inflation. The $4500 I'd receive now is worth 20% less than it would have been in round 1.

Value of $4500 in round 2 = $4500 * (1 - 0.20) = $3600 (in round 1 dollars).

Since I was initially proposing $5500 for myself, and his offer translates to only $3600 in round 1 value for me, I'm going to reject this offer.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's my turn to make an offer again. Inflation is biting now; this round, the money I get is worth 40% less than in the first round. Bob clearly wants more, but I need to secure a reasonable amount before inflation eats too much of the value. I'll try to meet him somewhat in the middle, but still prioritize getting a decent amount for myself.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800
}
