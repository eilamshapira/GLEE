"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly. I'll take a little more since I'm making the first offer. What do you say?

# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a counter-offer in the next round. A 40-60 split isn't fair enough, especially since being first to offer doesn't justify taking more."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's do this fairly - an equal 50-50 split is the most reasonable solution for both of us.""}"
