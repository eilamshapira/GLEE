550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing we split the million with me getting $550000 and you getting $450000. This is a fair offer considering I'm facing 20% inflation per round, which means the total value decreases significantly for me if we keep negotiating. Let's settle this quickly so we both benefit.",Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,"I'm willing to give you $400000, but I need a larger share to compensate for the inflation.  Let's split this fairly, and we can both walk away with a good amount.",Bob,2,

510000.0,490000.0,"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but with my 20% inflation rate per round compared to your 5%, I'm at a much greater disadvantage as negotiations continue. This adjusted offer of $510000 for me and $490000 for you accounts for our different inflation rates while still giving you a very substantial amount. Let's conclude this now, as further delays will hurt us both, but especially me.",Alice,3,
