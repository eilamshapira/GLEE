"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing we split the million with me getting $550,000 and you getting $450,000. This is a fair offer considering I'm facing 20% inflation per round, which means the total value decreases significantly for me if we keep negotiating. Let's settle this quickly so we both benefit.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you $400000, but I need a larger share to compensate for the inflation.  Let's split this fairly, and we can both walk away with a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 510000, ""bob_gain"": 490000, ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but with my 20% inflation rate per round compared to your 5%, I'm at a much greater disadvantage as negotiations continue. This adjusted offer of $510,000 for me and $490,000 for you accounts for our different inflation rates while still giving you a very substantial amount. Let's conclude this now, as further delays will hurt us both, but especially me.""}"
