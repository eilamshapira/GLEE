"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing we split the million with me getting $550000 and you getting $450000. This is a fair offer considering I'm facing 20% inflation per round, which means the total value decreases significantly for me if we keep negotiating. Let's settle this quickly so we both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you $400,000, but I need a larger share to compensate for the inflation.  Let's split this fairly, and we can both walk away with a good amount.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but with my 20% inflation rate per round compared to your 5%, I'm at a much greater disadvantage as negotiations continue. This adjusted offer of $510000 for me and $490000 for you accounts for our different inflation rates while still giving you a very substantial amount. Let's conclude this now, as further delays will hurt us both, but especially me. 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
