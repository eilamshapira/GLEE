"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, offering slightly more to Bob to incentivize acceptance and avoid the 10% inflation penalty on my share.

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}

I propose I get $450,000 and Bob gets $550,000. This is a reasonable split that gives Bob a bit more while still securing a good amount for myself before inflation can affect future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer as it's too unfavorable for me. Even considering the 10% inflation penalty I face, I would only get $270,000 in real value (300,000 * 0.9), while Bob would get $665,000 in real value (700,000 * 0.95). I can make a better counter-offer in the next round, even with further inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that we're in round 3, my share will be worth 20% less than the original value due to cumulative inflation (10% per round). I need to adjust my offer accordingly to compensate for this while still making it attractive enough for Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

With this offer, my real value would be $440,000 (550,000 * 0.8), and Bob's real value would be around $427,500 (assuming his inflation continues at 5% per round, so 450,000 * 0.9). This is more balanced in real terms and should be more attractive to Bob than another round of negotiations where we both lose more value to inflation."
