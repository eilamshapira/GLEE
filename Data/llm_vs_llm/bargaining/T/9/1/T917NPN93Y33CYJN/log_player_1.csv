"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Strategy**: Start with a reasonable offer that slightly favors me (Alice) but is still fair to Bob. This takes into account the different inflation rates affecting each player.
2. **Inflation Consideration**: Since the money devalues by 10% for me and 5% for Bob each round, it's crucial to reach an agreement quickly.
3. **Negotiation Tactics**: By offering Bob a substantial amount, I aim to make the offer attractive enough for him to accept, avoiding further devaluation of the money.

Let's see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Current Offer Analysis**: Bob's offer splits the money equally, which might seem fair at first glance. However, considering the inflation rates, this offer does not adequately compensate for the devaluation of money for me (Alice).
2. **Inflation Impact**: The money is now worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob. Accepting this offer would mean I get less value compared to my initial offer.
3. **Negotiation Strategy**: By rejecting this offer, I can propose a new division in the next round that better accounts for the inflation differences, aiming to secure a more favorable deal.

Let's proceed to the next round where I will make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5400,
  ""bob_gain"": 4600
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Adjusted Offer**: I'm offering a slightly lower amount for myself compared to the first round but still more than Bob's previous offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a favorable outcome.
2. **Inflation Consideration**: With each round, the value of the money decreases more for me than for Bob. This offer aims to balance the need for a quick resolution with getting a fair share.
3. **Negotiation Tactics**: By making a concession, I hope to make the offer appealing enough for Bob to accept, avoiding further devaluation.

Let's see how Bob responds to this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Offer Analysis**: Bob's offer gives me $4800 and him $5200. Given the inflation rates, this offer is reasonable considering the devaluation of money over the rounds.
2. **Inflation Impact**: The money is now worth 27.1% less for me and 14.26% less for Bob compared to the first round. Accepting this offer ensures I secure a substantial amount before further devaluation.
3. **Risk Assessment**: Continuing to the next rounds carries the risk of further devaluation and potentially getting nothing if no agreement is reached by the 12th round.

Accepting this offer ensures a fair outcome and mitigates the risk of losing more value due to inflation."
