"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider this offer carefully. 

Alice is offering a perfectly even split of $5,000 each. This is objectively fair from a mathematical perspective. While I might be able to negotiate for more in future rounds, there's no guarantee Alice would accept a more favorable offer to me.

Since there's no inflation penalty for me (0% as mentioned), I don't lose value by waiting. However, I don't know how inflation affects Alice - she might be motivated to settle quickly if she faces inflation penalties.

Given this is a fair split with no risk to me, I'll accept this reasonable offer.
