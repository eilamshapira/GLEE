"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $40 while she gets $60. Given that inflation reduces the value of money by 5% each round for me, if I reject this offer, future rounds would have less value. Let me think about whether this is fair or if I should make a counter-offer.

If I reject, I'll make the proposal next round, but my $100 will only be worth $95 in purchasing power. Even if I ask for more in the next round, the inflation effect reduces the real value.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I should propose something more favorable to me while still being reasonable enough for Alice to accept. Given that I face a 5% inflation penalty per round, it's in my interest to reach an agreement soon.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I propose a split where I receive $55 and Alice receives $45. This is a fair division that gives me a bit more than half while still offering Alice a substantial portion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting development. Now I know that Alice faces a much higher inflation rate than I do (36% vs. my 9.75% after two rounds). This changes the dynamics significantly as Alice has a stronger incentive to reach an agreement quickly.

Alice has slightly improved her offer to me from $40 to $42. However, given that she faces such high inflation, I believe I can negotiate for a better split in the next round. Her high inflation rate means her bargaining position weakens more rapidly than mine.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I now know that Alice faces a much higher inflation rate than I do (36% after 2 rounds compared to my 9.75%), I have a stronger negotiating position. The longer we go, the more urgency Alice should feel to reach an agreement. However, I don't want to be too aggressive and risk prolonging negotiations unnecessarily.

{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42}

I propose a split where I receive $58 and Alice receives $42. This gives me a slightly better offer than before but is also reasonable for Alice given her high inflation rate. It's also a mirror of her previous offer, showing I'm meeting her halfway between our positions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice continues to face severe inflation (59.04% less value from the first round compared to my 18.55%). Despite this disadvantage, she's only increased her offer to me by $2 (from $42 to $44).

Given that her money is rapidly losing value, and we're now 5 rounds in with 7 remaining, I think I can still negotiate for a better deal. Her high inflation rate should increase her urgency to settle.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","Alice's inflation rate is significantly higher than mine, which gives me negotiating leverage. However, I also need to be realistic about reaching an agreement before we hit the 12-round limit.

{""bob_gain"": 56, ""alice_gain"": 44}

I'm offering a split where I get $56 and Alice gets $44. This is a more moderate proposal than my previous one, matching Alice's last offer to me but with our positions reversed. Given Alice's high inflation rate (nearly 60% already), this should be increasingly attractive to her compared to continuing negotiations."
