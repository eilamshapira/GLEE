"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Due to inflation, my money is worth less.

Considering the offer from Bob:

*   **Alice's perceived gain:** The offer is for $45, but it's worth 10% less now, so it's effectively worth $45 * 0.90 = $40.50 (for me).
*   **Bob's perceived gain:** The offer is for $55, but it's worth 5% less now, so it's effectively worth $55 * 0.95 = $52.25 (for Bob).

I have to decide if $40.50 is better than risking nothing in the next round. Given that Bob has offered me a reasonable amount, and inflation is eating away at the value, I will accept this offer.
