"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering our different inflation rates (yours at 20% per round versus my 5%), this offer is actually beneficial for both of us. If we go another round, your $400000 would be worth only $320000 to you, while my loss would be smaller. This is a fair adjustment that recognizes our different time preferences. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
