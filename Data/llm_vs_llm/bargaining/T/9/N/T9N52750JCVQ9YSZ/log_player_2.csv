"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think through this. In the current round:
- Alice is offering a 50-50 split: $500,000 for each of us
- If I reject, we go to the next round where I make an offer
- But in the next round, the money is worth 5% less to me and 20% less to Alice

Given the different inflation rates, if we go to the next round, Alice will be more eager to accept my offer since her money devalues faster. This gives me some leverage.

I should be able to get more than a 50-50 split by making a counter-offer in the next round. Even accounting for my 5% inflation, I can likely secure a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given the inflation rates, I should propose a split that accounts for our different time preferences. Since Alice's money loses value faster (20% per round versus my 5%), she should be more willing to accept a lesser amount now rather than wait another round.

{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, considering our different inflation rates (yours at 20% per round versus my 5%), this offer is actually beneficial for both of us. If we go another round, your $400,000 would be worth only $320,000 to you, while my loss would be smaller. This is a fair adjustment that recognizes our different time preferences.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, given the rapid depreciation of the money for me, I'm proposing 320000 for myself and 680000 for you. This reflects the urgency for me to settle now, while still being generous towards you. Let's end this game before the value drops further. 
# Bob gain: 680000 
# Alice gain: 320000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

- Alice is offering me $680,000 and taking $320,000 for herself
- This is actually better for me than my previous offer ($600,000 for me, $400,000 for her)
- Due to inflation, this $680,000 is worth 9.75% less than in the first round, but that still makes it worth about $614,100 in first-round terms
- If I reject, we go to another round where I make an offer, but then:
  - My money would depreciate further (by 5% more)
  - Alice's money would depreciate even more (by 20% more)
  - Alice might be desperate enough to accept an even better offer for me

However, this is already a very good offer for me - 68% of the total, which is more than I asked for in the previous round. Given the uncertainty of future negotiations and the fact that my gains will continue to depreciate, accepting this offer seems prudent.
