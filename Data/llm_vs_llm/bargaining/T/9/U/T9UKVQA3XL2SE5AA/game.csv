800000.0,200000.0,I think this is a fair offer. Let's end this quickly and avoid inflation!,Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Alice, I'm proposing a more balanced split that accounts for our different inflation rates. If you reject this offer, the money will be worth 10% less to you in the next round, while only 5% less to me. This means I have less pressure to settle quickly. This 55-45 split is fair given these dynamics. Let's avoid further inflation losses for both of us.",Bob,2,

600000.0,400000.0,"Okay, Bob. Let's try this one. I understand inflation hurts us both, but I still want a larger portion. This is a fair compromise. Please accept this and end the game.",Alice,3,
