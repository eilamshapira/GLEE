"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm proposing a more balanced split that accounts for our different inflation rates. If you reject this offer, the money will be worth 10% less to you in the next round, while only 5% less to me. This means I have less pressure to settle quickly. This 55-45 split is fair given these dynamics. Let's avoid further inflation losses for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
