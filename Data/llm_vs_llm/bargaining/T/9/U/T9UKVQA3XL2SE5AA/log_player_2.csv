"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair offer. Let's end this quickly and avoid inflation! 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing I get $200,000 while she gets $800,000, which is a 20%-80% split in her favor.

If I reject, we'll go to the next round where I can make a counter-offer. However, due to inflation, the money will be worth 5% less to me and 10% less to Alice in the next round.

This means the $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $950,000 to me and $900,000 to Alice in the next round.

Since Alice faces higher inflation (10% vs my 5%), I have a strategic advantage by waiting. Also, a 20%-80% split is quite unfavorable to me.

I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced division that accounts for our different inflation rates and encourages Alice to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I'm proposing a more balanced split that accounts for our different inflation rates. If you reject this offer, the money will be worth 10% less to you in the next round, while only 5% less to me. This means I have less pressure to settle quickly. This 55-45 split is fair given these dynamics. Let's avoid further inflation losses for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob. Let's try this one. I understand inflation hurts us both, but I still want a larger portion. This is a fair compromise. Please accept this and end the game. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer carefully. She's proposing I get $400,000 while she gets $600,000, which is a 40%-60% split.

Let me consider the inflation effects:
- For me, this $400,000 is worth about 9.75% less than in the first round, so it's equivalent to about $361,000 of original value
- For Alice, her $600,000 is worth 19% less than in the first round, so it's equivalent to about $486,000 of original value

If I reject, we'll go to round 4 where:
- My inflation penalty increases to about 14.25% (another 5%)
- Alice's inflation penalty increases to about 27.1% (another 10%)

Alice's offer has improved substantially from her first offer. The split is now closer to fair, and the inflation is becoming significant. Given that Alice is facing higher inflation pressure, this offer represents a reasonable compromise.
