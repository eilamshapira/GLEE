Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

Even though Alice gets slightly more, the inflation means I'd be getting less than $50 in real value if I wait for another round.  It's better to take a slightly smaller amount now than risk getting even less later."
