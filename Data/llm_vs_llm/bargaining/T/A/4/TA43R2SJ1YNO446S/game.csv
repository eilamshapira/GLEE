1.0,9999.0,"Alice, I understand your wish to split fairly, but time doesn't favor you. Accepting now secures you $1 (worth $0.95 in today’s value), whereas delaying only reduces your share further. I believe this token amount, though small, is better than the diminishing alternatives. Please accept this offer.",Bob,2,

5700.0,4300.0,"I know time is against us, but I believe a slightly better offer can still be reached. Let's work together for a win-win!",Alice,3,

6050.0,3950.0,"Alice, I know we both want to maximize our gains, and time is costing you more each round. In this proposal, you’d receive $6050 nominally, which at this round’s discount translates to roughly $6050 × 0.8574 ≈ $5185 in value—slightly better than the effective value in the previous proposals. I believe this is a fair compromise given the circumstances. Let's agree now and secure our respective benefits before further time diminishes our shares!",Bob,4,
