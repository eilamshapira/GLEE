"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your wish to split fairly, but time doesn't favor you. Accepting now secures you $1 (worth $0.95 in today’s value), whereas delaying only reduces your share further. I believe this token amount, though small, is better than the diminishing alternatives. Please accept this offer. 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 9999

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know we both want to maximize our gains, and time is costing you more each round. In this proposal, you’d receive $6050 nominally, which at this round’s discount translates to roughly $6050 × 0.8574 ≈ $5185 in value—slightly better than the effective value in the previous proposals. I believe this is a fair compromise given the circumstances. Let's agree now and secure our respective benefits before further time diminishes our shares! 
# Alice gain: 6050 
# Bob gain: 3950
