"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair division. I hope we can agree on this! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 9999, ""alice_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your wish to split fairly, but time doesn't favor you. Accepting now secures you $1 (worth $0.95 in today’s value), whereas delaying only reduces your share further. I believe this token amount, though small, is better than the diminishing alternatives. Please accept this offer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I know time is against us, but I believe a slightly better offer can still be reached. Let's work together for a win-win! 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 3950, ""alice_gain"": 6050, ""message"": ""Alice, I know we both want to maximize our gains, and time is costing you more each round. In this proposal, you’d receive $6050 nominally, which at this round’s discount translates to roughly $6050 × 0.8574 ≈ $5185 in value—slightly better than the effective value in the previous proposals. I believe this is a fair compromise given the circumstances. Let's agree now and secure our respective benefits before further time diminishes our shares!""}"
