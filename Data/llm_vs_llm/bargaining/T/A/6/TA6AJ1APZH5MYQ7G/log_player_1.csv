"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split that accounts for the higher inflation penalty I face. Since my money loses value faster (20% vs 10% per round), I should aim for a reasonable first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split because it's close to equal but slightly in my favor to account for my higher inflation penalty. It's fair enough that Bob should seriously consider accepting it rather than moving to the next round where both of our potential gains would be reduced by inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

My $4500 with 20% inflation is worth $3600
Bob's $5500 with 10% inflation is worth $4950

If I reject and we go to round 3, any amount I get will be worth 40% less than original value, which means even if I got the full $10,000, it would only be worth $6000 to me. Plus, Bob might offer even less.

Given these factors, I will accept this offer since it gives me a reasonable amount and waiting would likely result in worse outcomes due to the higher inflation rate I face.
