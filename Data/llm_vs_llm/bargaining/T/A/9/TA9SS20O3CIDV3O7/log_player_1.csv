"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, consider this: If you reject, you'll propose in round 3—but due to your 10% inflation penalty per round, your effective gains would be almost nothing. I'm offering you a minimal share now—$1—to give you just a bit more value than waiting would. Accept and secure your gain. 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
