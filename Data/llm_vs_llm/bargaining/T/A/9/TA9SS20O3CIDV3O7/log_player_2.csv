Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 999999, ""alice_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Alice, consider this: If you reject, you'll propose in round 3—but due to your 10% inflation penalty per round, your effective gains would be almost nothing. I'm offering you a minimal share now—$1—to give you just a bit more value than waiting would. Accept and secure your gain.""}"
