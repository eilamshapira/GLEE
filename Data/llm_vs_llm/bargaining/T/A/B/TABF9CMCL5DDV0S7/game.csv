600000.0,400000.0,Let's start with a fair split. This offer gives you a substantial amount while ensuring I also get a fair share.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Given our different inflation rates, this is a fair offer that gives you $450000 before significant devaluation occurs. If we continue negotiating, your share will be worth much less due to the 20% inflation rate you face.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"I understand your position, but we need to consider the impact of inflation on both of us. This offer aims to balance our gains more equitably given the different inflation rates we face.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Let's be practical here. At this point, your share is already heavily impacted by the 20% per round inflation. This $400000 now is worth more to you than $550000 will be in the next round. This is a fair offer considering our different inflation rates, and further delays will significantly reduce the real value of your share.",Bob,4,
