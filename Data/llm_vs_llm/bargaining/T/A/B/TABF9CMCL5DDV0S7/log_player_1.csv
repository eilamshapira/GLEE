Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given our different inflation rates, this is a fair offer that gives you $450000 before significant devaluation occurs. If we continue negotiating, your share will be worth much less due to the 20% inflation rate you face. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Given the inflation rates and the need to reach an agreement before the money loses too much value for me, I'll propose a more balanced split this time.

  ""bob_gain"": 450000,

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be practical here. At this point, your share is already heavily impacted by the 20% per round inflation. This $400000 now is worth more to you than $550000 will be in the next round. This is a fair offer considering our different inflation rates, and further delays will significantly reduce the real value of your share. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000
