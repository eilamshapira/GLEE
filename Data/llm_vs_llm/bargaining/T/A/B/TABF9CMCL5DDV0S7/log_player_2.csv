"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. This offer gives you a substantial amount while ensuring I also get a fair share. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $400,000 for me, $600,000 for Alice
2. If I reject, money will be worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Alice next round
3. The devaluation rate difference (20% vs 5%) works in my favor as rounds progress
4. Alice is starting with a 60/40 split in her favor, which isn't particularly fair
5. Given the difference in devaluation rates, I can likely get a better deal by making a counter-offer

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a strategic offer:

Given that Alice's money devalues faster (20% per round) compared to mine (5%), she has more incentive to accept a deal sooner. I'll propose a more balanced split but still reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Given our different inflation rates, this is a fair offer that gives you $450,000 before significant devaluation occurs. If we continue negotiating, your share will be worth much less due to the 20% inflation rate you face.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, but we need to consider the impact of inflation on both of us. This offer aims to balance our gains more equitably given the different inflation rates we face. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice's offering $450,000 to me (worth 90.25% of original value = ~$406,125 in round 1 terms)
2. She wants $550,000 (worth 64% of original value = ~$352,000 in round 1 terms)
3. The devaluation is clearly hurting Alice more than me
4. If I reject, next round my money will be worth 14.5% less than original, while hers will be worth 48.8% less
5. However, I could still get a better deal as her money is devaluing much faster

Given that Alice's portion is devaluing much more quickly than mine, and we still have 9 rounds left, I believe I can get a better deal by continuing negotiation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that Alice's money has already devalued by 36% and mine by only 9.75%, I can push for a better split now. The longer we negotiate, the worse it gets for Alice due to her higher inflation rate.

{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Let's be practical here. At this point, your share is already heavily impacted by the 20% per round inflation. This $400,000 now is worth more to you than $550,000 will be in the next round. This is a fair offer considering our different inflation rates, and further delays will significantly reduce the real value of your share.""}"
