"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair but strategic offer to Bob considering the 10% inflation per round for me.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split of the $10,000, which I believe is fair and gives us both equal shares of the money. Since I know we face 10% inflation with each passing round, it's in my interest to reach an agreement sooner rather than later."
