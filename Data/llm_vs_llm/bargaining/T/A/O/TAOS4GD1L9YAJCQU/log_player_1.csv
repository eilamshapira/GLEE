"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $600,000 and giving Bob $400,000, with a message suggesting that this is a fair starting point. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split in my favor is a fair start, considering I'll be making the next offer if you decline. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $400,000, which is worth 10% less to me, so it's effectively $360,000.

On the other hand, if I reject the offer, I'll get to make a counteroffer in the next round, but the money will be worth even less to me due to inflation.

Given the circumstances, I think it's better to accept Bob's offer rather than risking further devaluation of the money.
