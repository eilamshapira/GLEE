"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer. She's proposing a 50-50 split of the $10,000, where we each get $5,000.

Given that:
1. This is a fair split at face value
2. If I reject, the total value decreases by 5% for me in the next round
3. Even if I propose a better deal for myself in the next round, Alice might reject it
4. The 5% inflation means the maximum I could get next round would be worth less than $5,000 now

I'll accept this offer, as it's fair and avoids the inflation penalty.
