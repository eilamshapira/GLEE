"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid risk""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: How about a slight advantage for you? Let's make this easier. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is still worth the same, and Bob's offer gives me a slight advantage, I'll accept it.
