471000.0,529000.0,"Bob, here's my proposal: I take $471000 and you get $529000. Given that each extra round costs me 20% and you only lose 10%, you’re in a slightly stronger position if we delay further. This split gives you what you'd expect to get by waiting, so let’s settle now and avoid further value loss.",Alice,1,
