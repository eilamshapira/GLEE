"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 471000, ""bob_gain"": 529000, ""message"": ""Bob, here's my proposal: I take $471,000 and you get $529,000. Given that each extra round costs me 20% and you only lose 10%, you’re in a slightly stronger position if we delay further. This split gives you what you'd expect to get by waiting, so let’s settle now and avoid further value loss.""}"
