"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, here's my proposal: I take $471000 and you get $529000. Given that each extra round costs me 20% and you only lose 10%, you’re in a slightly stronger position if we delay further. This split gives you what you'd expect to get by waiting, so let’s settle now and avoid further value loss. 
# Bob gain: 529000 
# Alice gain: 471000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
