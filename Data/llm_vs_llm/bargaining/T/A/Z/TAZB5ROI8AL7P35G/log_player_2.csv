"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to analyze this offer carefully. Alice is offering a 50-50 split of the $100, which seems fair at first glance. However, I need to consider the inflation factors.

If I reject and we move to the next round, the money will be worth 10% less to me and 5% less to Alice. This means in the next round, the $100 would effectively be worth $90 to me and $95 to Alice. Since I would be making the offer in the next round, I could potentially get a better deal for myself.

However, there's risk in rejecting a fair offer, as Alice could reject my counter-offer, leading to further rounds and more value loss for both of us.

Given that this is the first round with no inflation yet, and the offer is equal, I'll accept.
