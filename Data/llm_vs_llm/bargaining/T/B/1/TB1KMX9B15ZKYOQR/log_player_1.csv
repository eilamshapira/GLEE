"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I suggest a fair 60-40 split in my favor since I need to account for the 10% inflation penalty I face in future rounds.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since the money is worth 10% less to you now ($90 effective value), I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This gives you $45 now, which is better than risking another round where your $100 would only be worth $81. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think this through:
- If I accept now, I get $45 (which is worth $45 due to 10% inflation in round 2)
- If I reject and make a new offer in round 3, the money will be worth another 10% less to me (only $81 total value)
- Bob's reasoning is sound - getting $45 now is better than risking further devaluation
