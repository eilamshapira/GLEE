"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a fair 60-40 split in my favor since I need to account for the 10% inflation penalty I face in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice offers me $40, keeping $60 for herself
2. If I reject, we go to next round where:
   - I can make an offer
   - The money's value stays the same for me
   - The money's value drops 10% for Alice
3. This means in the next round, $100 is only worth $90 to Alice
4. I could offer a split more favorable to me, and Alice might accept to avoid further devaluation

Given these factors, I believe I can get a better deal by rejecting this offer and making my own proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a strategic offer considering Alice's 10% value loss per round:

{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Since the money is worth 10% less to you now ($90 effective value), I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This gives you $45 now, which is better than risking another round where your $100 would only be worth $81.""}

Reasoning:
1. The $100 is now worth only $90 to Alice
2. If she rejects, next round it will be worth only $81 to her
3. My offer of $45 now is actually worth $45 to her, which is better than potentially getting $60 that's worth only $54 in real value
4. This is a reasonable compromise that accounts for her inflation penalty while improving my position"
