450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. This still gives you a substantial $450000, and since you mentioned concerns about inflation affecting future rounds, this seems like a reasonable deal that benefits us both. I think this is fair considering the game structure, and we can conclude the negotiation now.",Bob,2,

475000.0,525000.0,"Bob, considering the inflation affecting my share and your last proposal, I suggest a 47.5/52.5 split in your favor. This offer is more generous than your last one to me, yet it still accounts for the inflation impact on my side. Let's end this now before the value decreases further.",Alice,3,
