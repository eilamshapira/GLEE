"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly down the middle, 50-50. It's a fair start and we can end the game now without any losses due to inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. This still gives you a substantial $450000, and since you mentioned concerns about inflation affecting future rounds, this seems like a reasonable deal that benefits us both. I think this is fair considering the game structure, and we can conclude the negotiation now. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 475000,
  ""bob_gain"": 525000,
  ""message"": ""Bob, considering the inflation affecting my share and your last proposal, I suggest a 47.5/52.5 split in your favor. This offer is more generous than your last one to me, yet it still accounts for the inflation impact on my side. Let's end this now before the value decreases further.""
