"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly down the middle, 50-50. It's a fair start and we can end the game now without any losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer carefully.

Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which would give each of us $500,000. This is objectively a fair division in terms of pure equality.

Since there's no inflation affecting me (0% inflation), I don't lose value by continuing to another round. However, I don't know how inflation affects Alice, which creates some uncertainty. If Alice faces significant inflation, she might be more willing to accept a better offer from me in the next round.

Given that I can make a counter-proposal in the next round without any penalty to myself, and there's potential for me to get a more favorable split, it seems reasonable to reject this offer.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a slightly more favorable offer for myself since I have the opportunity to propose now.

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. This still gives you a substantial $450,000, and since you mentioned concerns about inflation affecting future rounds, this seems like a reasonable deal that benefits us both. I think this is fair considering the game structure, and we can conclude the negotiation now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering the inflation affecting my share and your last proposal, I suggest a 47.5/52.5 split in your favor. This offer is more generous than your last one to me, yet it still accounts for the inflation impact on my side. Let's end this now before the value decreases further. 
# Bob gain: 525000 
# Alice gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze Alice's new offer.

Alice is now offering me $525,000 (52.5%) while she would receive $475,000 (47.5%). This is more favorable to me than her initial 50-50 split. 

I now have additional information that Alice faces a 9.75% inflation penalty, which explains why she's more willing to conclude the negotiation. For her, the longer we negotiate, the less value her share will have.

Since I don't face any inflation (0%), I could reject and try for an even better deal in the next round. However, there are a few considerations:
- Alice's offer is already better than her first offer and gives me more than half
- If I make another counteroffer and Alice rejects, she might propose an even less favorable split in round 5
- The deal being offered now is quite reasonable

Given these factors, and particularly since I'm already getting more than half of the money without any inflation risk to me, this seems like a good offer to accept.
