"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I get 60%, you get 40%. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000
2. If I reject, the value will decrease by 5% in the next round
3. This means in the next round, the total value for me will be worth $9,500
4. 40% is less than an equal split, but getting something now might be better than risking further devaluation

While 40% isn't ideal, waiting could be risky due to inflation. However, I believe I can get a better deal by making the next proposal, even accounting for the 5% inflation.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while acknowledging the time pressure we both face:

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's do a fair 50-50 split. This way we both get an equal share, and we avoid losing value to inflation. It's the most equitable solution.""}"
