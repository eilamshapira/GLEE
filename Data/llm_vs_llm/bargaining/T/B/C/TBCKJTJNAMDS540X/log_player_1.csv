"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I need to factor in the declining value of the money each round. Since this is round 1, the value hasn't yet declined, but I need to consider Bob's perspective as well as the threat of future rounds.

Here's my offer, designed to be appealing to Bob while still giving me a good portion of the initial value. I am aiming for a split that gives me a slight advantage, acknowledging my role as proposer.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

My rationale:
*   **Bob gets a significant amount:** $450,000 is a substantial sum. This hopefully makes him less likely to reject the offer.
*   **I get more than Bob**: Giving me a slight advantage as proposer.
*   **Round 1 advantage:** Trying to get a better deal in the first round before inflation kicks in."
