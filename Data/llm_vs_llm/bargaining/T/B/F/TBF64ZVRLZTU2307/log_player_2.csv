"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's work together and start with a fair split. We both get something! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me 4000$ out of the 10,000$ total, which is 40% of the money. While this isn't an even split, if I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, I'll be affected by 20% inflation, so my money will be worth less.

Let me calculate: If I reject, and offer myself 6000$ in the next round, that would be worth only 4800$ to me after inflation. I could try for more, but there's a risk Alice would reject, leading to further inflation in subsequent rounds.

Given the inflation pressure on my side and the reasonable starting offer, I'll accept this offer.
