"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I propose a fair, equal split of $1000000â€”$500000 each. Settling now avoids any loss in value due to inflation for me, and it ensures both of us secure our maximum share. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $500,000 for me
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
   * The money will be worth 10% less to me
   * Maximum I could get would be $900,000, but worth only $810,000 due to inflation
   * And Alice might reject that anyway

A 50-50 split is traditionally considered fair, and I'm guaranteed to get less value if we move to the next round due to inflation. While I could try to negotiate for more, the inflation penalty makes this risky.
