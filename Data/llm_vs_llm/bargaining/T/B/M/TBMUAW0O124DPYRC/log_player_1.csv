"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","For the first round, I'll make a reasonable offer. Since we have 12 rounds to divide the money, I'll start by offering a split that's slightly in my favor, but still leaves a significant amount for Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 950000 
# Bob gain: 50000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less due to inflation, the actual values would be:
Alice gain: 950000 * 0.95 = 902500
Bob gain: 50000 * 0.95 = 47500

This offer seems extremely one-sided in my favor. While it's a large amount for me, I should consider the potential for future offers and the fact that Bob might make a more reasonable proposal in the next round if I reject this one.

However, given the significant difference in the proposed amounts, I think it's in my best interest to accept this offer.
