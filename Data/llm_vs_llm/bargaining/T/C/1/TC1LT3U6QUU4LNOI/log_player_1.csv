"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a fair offer to start the negotiations with Bob:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's start with an equal split that's fair to both of us. The longer we negotiate, the less value we both get due to inflation, so this is a win-win.""
}
