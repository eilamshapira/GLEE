"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's start with an equal split that's fair to both of us. The longer we negotiate, the less value we both get due to inflation, so this is a win-win. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a larger share, but I need to consider the inflation effect on my side too. This is still a very fair offer that gives us both a good portion before inflation reduces our gains further. Let's wrap this up quickly to maximize our total value. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200
