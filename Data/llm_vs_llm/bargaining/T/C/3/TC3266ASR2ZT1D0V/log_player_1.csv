I'm proposing a 60/40 split, keeping $6,000 for myself and giving $4,000 to Bob.  This seems like a fair starting point, considering we both have equal power in this game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
