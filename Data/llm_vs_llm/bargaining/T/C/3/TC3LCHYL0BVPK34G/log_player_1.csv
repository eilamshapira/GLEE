"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid inflation losses""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a slightly better share for me to account for potential future inflation losses. Let's settle this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect on my potential gain, I'll have to think carefully. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, the $40 offered to me is effectively worth $32.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, the original $100 is now worth $64 to me (80% of $80, which is 80% of the original $100 after two rounds of 20% inflation). I'll try to get a fair share.

{""alice_gain"": 45, 
""bob_gain"": 55, 
""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground before inflation reduces our gains further""}"
