"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's make it simple and fair: a 50/50 split. We both save time and avoid the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's 50-50 offer. While I could try to negotiate for more, the 20% inflation penalty means that delaying would reduce my real gains significantly. A 5000$ share now is better than risking further rounds where my share would be worth less due to inflation. This is a fair and reasonable split that allows us both to walk away with a good outcome."
