Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I know you value a quick resolution. My share loses 5% each round, so continuing the negotiation further will hurt me even more. To avoid any delays, I'm offering you $95 now while I take only $5. Let's settle quickly and both walk away with our money. 
# Alice gain: 95 
# Bob gain: 5 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
