"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I should reject this offer as it's quite unfair, giving me only 10% of the total amount. Even with the 10% inflation penalty per round, I can likely negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split, considering that I'm at a disadvantage due to the 10% inflation penalty per round. I'll aim for a fair but attractive offer that Alice is likely to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000}

I propose this split because:
1. It's much more equitable than the previous offer
2. Alice still gets the majority (55%) which makes it attractive to accept
3. If Alice rejects, their next offer would need to be compelling since I'm facing 10% inflation per round"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Alice is offering me $300,000
2. Due to 19% inflation, this is actually worth $243,000 to me
3. This is better than her first offer of $100,000
4. If I reject, I'll face even more inflation (29%) in the next round
5. While not ideal, this is a significant improvement from the initial offer
6. Given the increasing inflation pressure, further negotiation might leave me worse off
