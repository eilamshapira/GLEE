600000.0,400000.0,"Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I take 60% and you take 40%.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
500000.0,500000.0,I propose a fair 50-50 split. This is the most equitable solution for both of us.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Okay, Bob, let's meet in the middle. I'll take 55% and you get 45%.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
475000.0,525000.0,"Since you're affected by inflation and I'm not, this split is actually fair for both of us. Your portion needs to be decided quickly before it loses more value, while I can afford to wait. This is a reasonable offer that benefits us both.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
520000.0,480000.0,"Bob, it's clear we need to compromise. I'm willing to come down a little more. 52% for me, 48% for you. Let's settle this before inflation eats away at the value any further.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, let's be practical. With your 34.39% inflation rate, waiting longer will only hurt you more. Even with this 60-40 split, you should accept now because further delays will reduce your real value significantly. This is actually a fair offer considering our different inflation situations.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Bob, it's clear you're not affected by inflation the way I am.  Let's be fair and split it 50/50. This is my final offer.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"Alice, let's be realistic about our situations. Your money has lost nearly 47% of its value, while mine hasn't lost any. Even with this 70-30 split, you should accept now because your real value is diminishing rapidly. If we continue negotiating, inflation will eat away even more of your share. This is actually merciful given our circumstances.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I understand my position is weakening, but I'm not desperate yet.  I'll take 45% - that's my final offer.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
200000.0,800000.0,"Alice, your share has lost almost 57% of its value, making your $450000 worth less than $200000 in real terms. This 80-20 split actually gives you about the same real value as your last offer would have, and we both avoid the risk of getting nothing. With only 2 rounds left after this, you need to seriously consider accepting before your position weakens further.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"Bob, this is my last offer.  35% or we both get nothing. Don't push your luck.",Alice,11,
