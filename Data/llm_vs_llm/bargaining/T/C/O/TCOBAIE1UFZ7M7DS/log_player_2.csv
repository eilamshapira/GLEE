"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I take 60% and you take 40%. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
- She's offering me $400,000 (40%) while taking $600,000 (60%)
- This is the first round, and I have bargaining power
- I don't know Alice's inflation rate, but mine is 0%
- We have 11 more rounds if needed
- I can make a counter-offer in the next round

The split is not terrible, but since I'm not affected by inflation and it's early in the game, I believe I can negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced counter-offer:

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. This is the most equitable solution for both of us.""}

My reasoning:
- A 50-50 split is fair and reasonable
- Since I'm not affected by inflation, I can afford to negotiate firmly
- This offer shows I'm willing to be fair but won't accept a disadvantageous position
- It's still early in the game, so there's room for negotiation if Alice rejects"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's meet in the middle. I'll take 55% and you get 45%. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze Alice's new offer:
- She's offering me $450,000 (45%) while taking $550,000 (55%)
- I now know Alice is affected by inflation (19% loss since round 1)
- Her $550,000 is actually worth less to her now due to inflation
- I'm not affected by inflation at all
- We still have 9 more rounds if needed

Given that Alice is affected by inflation and I'm not, I have a stronger negotiating position. While this offer is better than her first one, I think I can still get a better deal by waiting, as her position weakens with inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that Alice is facing significant inflation and I'm not, I'll maintain a firm position but show some movement from my previous offer:

{""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Since you're affected by inflation and I'm not, this split is actually fair for both of us. Your portion needs to be decided quickly before it loses more value, while I can afford to wait. This is a reasonable offer that benefits us both.""}

My reasoning:
- I'm seeking a slightly larger share (52.5%) given my stronger negotiating position
- Alice's money is losing value with each round (already 19% less)
- I'm showing I understand the inflation dynamic
- This offer is still reasonable enough that it might be attractive to Alice given her declining position
- If she rejects, her negotiating position will continue to weaken due to inflation"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we need to compromise. I'm willing to come down a little more. 52% for me, 48% for you. Let's settle this before inflation eats away at the value any further. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze Alice's new offer:
- She's offering me $480,000 (48%) while taking $520,000 (52%)
- Her inflation has increased significantly to 34.39%
- Her $520,000 is actually worth only about $341,172 to her due to inflation
- I'm still not affected by inflation at all
- We still have 7 more rounds if needed

While Alice is moving in the right direction, her inflation situation is getting significantly worse. Her portion is worth much less now, and my negotiating position is getting stronger. Since I'm not affected by inflation, I can afford to wait for an even better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given Alice's rapidly deteriorating position due to inflation, I'll push for a more favorable split:

{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be practical. With your 34.39% inflation rate, waiting longer will only hurt you more. Even with this 60-40 split, you should accept now because further delays will reduce your real value significantly. This is actually a fair offer considering our different inflation situations.""}

My reasoning:
- Alice's money has lost over a third of its value, while mine maintains full value
- Her negotiating position is weakening rapidly
- The 60-40 split might seem aggressive, but given the inflation rate, waiting will cost her more
- We're halfway through the rounds, increasing pressure to make a deal
- If she rejects, her next offer will likely need to be more favorable to me due to continuing inflation
- Still leaving room for negotiation if needed, but taking a stronger position"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear you're not affected by inflation the way I am.  Let's be fair and split it 50/50. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze the situation:
- Alice is offering a 50-50 split now
- Her inflation has increased dramatically to 46.86%
- Her $500,000 would actually only be worth about $265,700 to her
- I would get my full $500,000 with no inflation
- We have 5 rounds left
- She says this is her ""final offer""

While she says this is her final offer, her position is extremely weak due to inflation. Her share is worth less than half of its original value, while mine maintains full value. Given that my position continues to strengthen with each round, and I have no inflation pressure, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given Alice's severe inflation situation and my strengthened position, I'll push for an even more favorable split:

{""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic about our situations. Your money has lost nearly 47% of its value, while mine hasn't lost any. Even with this 70-30 split, you should accept now because your real value is diminishing rapidly. If we continue negotiating, inflation will eat away even more of your share. This is actually merciful given our circumstances.""}

My reasoning:
- Alice's money has lost almost half its value
- She's shown desperation with her ""final offer"" claim in the previous round
- My position continues to strengthen as her inflation worsens
- We're now 2/3 through the rounds, increasing pressure to make a deal
- The 70-30 split, while aggressive, reflects the reality of our vastly different inflation situations
- If she rejects, her next offer will likely need to be even more favorable to me due to continuing inflation
- We still have 4 rounds left if needed, but the threat of getting nothing at the end becomes more real"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I understand my position is weakening, but I'm not desperate yet.  I'll take 45% - that's my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze Alice's latest offer:
- She's offering me $550,000 (55%) while taking $450,000 (45%)
- Her inflation has increased to a severe 56.95%
- Her $450,000 would actually only be worth about $193,725 to her
- I would get my full $550,000 with no inflation
- We have 3 rounds left
- She's claiming this is her ""final offer"" again

Despite her claim about not being desperate, her position is extremely weak:
- Her money is worth less than half its nominal value
- She's already had to make one ""final offer"" before
- My negotiating position continues to strengthen
- With only 3 rounds left, the risk of getting nothing increases, but I'm still in the stronger position

Given these factors, I'll reject this offer and push for an even better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given the extremely weak position Alice is in, with her money having lost nearly 57% of its value, I'll push for an even more favorable split:

{""bob_gain"": 800000,
""alice_gain"": 200000,
""message"": ""Alice, your share has lost almost 57% of its value, making your $450,000 worth less than $200,000 in real terms. This 80-20 split actually gives you about the same real value as your last offer would have, and we both avoid the risk of getting nothing. With only 2 rounds left after this, you need to seriously consider accepting before your position weakens further.""}

My reasoning:
- Alice's money has lost almost 57% of its value, making her negotiating position extremely weak
- We're now very close to the end (only 2 rounds left after this)
- The risk of getting nothing is becoming very real for both of us
- My 80-20 split, while aggressive, actually gives her similar real value to what she just offered me
- If she rejects, her next offer will need to be even more favorable to me due to continuing inflation
- The pressure of the deadline and her severe inflation should make this offer more appealing
- Still maintaining some room for final negotiation if needed"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 65.13% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my last offer.  35% or we both get nothing. Don't push your luck. 
# Bob gain: 650000 
# Alice gain: 350000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this critical situation:
- Alice is offering me $650,000 (65%) while taking $350,000 (35%)
- Her inflation has increased to 65.13%
- Her $350,000 would actually only be worth about $122,045 to her
- I would get my full $650,000 with no inflation
- Only 1 round left after this
- The threat of getting nothing is now very real

While my position is still stronger, the risk of getting nothing is significant:
- If I reject, we'll have only one round left
- If the final round fails, we both get zero
- $650,000 is a substantial amount that I'd get in full value

Given the high stakes and the decent offer, I'll accept this deal rather than risk getting nothing.
