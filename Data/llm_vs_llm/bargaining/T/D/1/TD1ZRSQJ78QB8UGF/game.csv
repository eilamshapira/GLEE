60.0,40.0,Let's split it 60-40 in my favor to account for inflation. It's a fair start considering the decreasing value of the money for me.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"I acknowledge the impact of inflation, but a 60-40 split is too drastic for the first round. How about a 55-45 split in my favor? This gives me a slight edge considering the decreasing value, while still offering you a significant portion.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,Let's split it 55-45 in my favor. This considers the inflation impact on me and ensures we both get a fair share. Accepting this offer will prevent further loss of value for me.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
48.0,52.0,"Alice, I'm trying to be fair, but you need to meet me halfway. I understand the inflation impacts you, but trying to flip my previous offer is not a sign of good faith. Let's settle on 52-48 in my favor. This recognizes the changing value while still providing a decent outcome for both.",Bob,4,
