"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40 in my favor to account for inflation. It's a fair start considering the decreasing value of the money for me. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```
While Alice brings up a relevant point about inflation, her offer is too skewed in her favor for a starting point.  I'm willing to negotiate, but a more balanced initial offer is necessary."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I acknowledge the impact of inflation, but a 60-40 split is too drastic for the first round. How about a 55-45 split in my favor? This gives me a slight edge considering the decreasing value, while still offering you a significant portion.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 55-45 in my favor. This considers the inflation impact on me and ensures we both get a fair share. Accepting this offer will prevent further loss of value for me. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is trying to take advantage of the situation.  While I understand the inflation impacts her, her offer doesn't reflect a fair negotiation.  I proposed a 55-45 split in my favor in the previous round, which would have been more reasonable. I'm open to a deal but this feels manipulative."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 52,
""alice_gain"": 48,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm trying to be fair, but you need to meet me halfway. I understand the inflation impacts you, but trying to flip my previous offer is not a sign of good faith. Let's settle on 52-48 in my favor. This recognizes the changing value while still providing a decent outcome for both.""
