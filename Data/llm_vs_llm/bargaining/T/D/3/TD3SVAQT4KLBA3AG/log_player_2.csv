"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split it 55/45. This is a fair offer considering we don't know how inflation affects you, and I'm giving you a good head start! Let's avoid any further delays that could devalue the money. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $45 out of $100, while taking $55 for herself. 

If I reject and move to the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation, meaning the $100 would effectively be worth $80 to me. If I were to propose a 50/50 split in the next round, that would give me $40 worth of value (50% of $80).

Since $45 now is better than the possibility of $40 in the next round (and that's assuming Alice accepts my next offer), accepting this offer seems reasonable.
