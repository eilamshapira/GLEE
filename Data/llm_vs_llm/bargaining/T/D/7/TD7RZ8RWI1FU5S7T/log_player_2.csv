"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly considering the inflation affects you more. This offer gives you a significant portion while ensuring we both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the game. I'm playing as Bob and need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer, considering the inflation that affects my portion of the money each round.

Here's the calculation I need to consider:

*   **Round 1 offer:** I get $400,000.
*   **If I reject:** The money depreciates by 20% each round for me.

Let's consider a couple of scenarios: if I reject and counter in round 2 and then get a successful offer:

* Round 2 money available to me: 1,000,000
* Value after inflation: 800,000

If I reject and we reach the last round:

* Round 12 money available to me: 1,000,000
* Value after inflation: 71,673

Since the current offer of $400,000 is better than what I expect to get in later rounds accounting for inflation, and since Alice is not affected by the inflation, it is in my best interest to accept her offer.
