"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, considering I'm making the first move and taking initiative. This is a fair offer that gives us both a substantial amount.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose a 50-50 split. This way we both get an equal share and ensure that we walk away with something. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Rationale (not part of response): With 5% inflation, $5000 is worth $4750 to me now. I can make a counter-offer in the next round that might give me more value, even accounting for another 5% inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Bob, considering the inflation affecting me, I need a bit more to match your effective 50-50 offer. This 55-45 split actually gives us similar real value when accounting for my 10% cumulative inflation loss. Let's agree and finish this now.""}"
