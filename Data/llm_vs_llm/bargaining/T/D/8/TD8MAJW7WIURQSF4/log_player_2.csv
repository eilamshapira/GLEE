Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering the inflation affecting me, I need a bit more to match your effective 50-50 offer. This 55-45 split actually gives us similar real value when accounting for my 10% cumulative inflation loss. Let's agree and finish this now. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
