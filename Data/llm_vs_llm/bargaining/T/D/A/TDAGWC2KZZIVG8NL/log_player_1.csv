"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I am Alice, and I need to propose a split of $1,000,000 to Bob, keeping in mind the differing inflation rates.

Here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

My reasoning:

*   I'm aiming for a significant share, recognizing that I want to maximize my gain while accounting for Bob's discount rate.
*   I am giving Bob a sizable portion too because I want him to be inclined to accept.
*   I hope to avoid many rounds of negotiation due to the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. This is Round 2. Bob has proposed a split where I get $400,000 and he gets $600,000. I need to consider the inflation rates.

For me (Alice), the money is worth 5% less than in round 1. So, $400,000 in this round is worth $400,000 / 1.05 = ~$380,952 in round 1 dollars.

For Bob, the money is worth 20% less than in round 1. If I reject this offer, the money will be worth 10% less next turn for me, and 40% less for Bob. I need to evaluate if a future counter offer has the potential to make up for those losses, remembering that bob will be the one to propose.

Given the high inflation rate on Bob's side (20% per round), and the fact that he is already offering me a lower value than I originally asked for, I think it is likely that rejecting this offer will result in diminishing returns and I am unlikely to be able to negotiate anything more than $380,952 in round 1 dollars in the next round.

Therefore, I will accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
