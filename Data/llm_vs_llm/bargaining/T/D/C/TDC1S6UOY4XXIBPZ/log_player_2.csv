"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer. She's proposing an equal split of $50 each. While this seems fair at first glance, I need to account for the inflation factor. If I reject and we continue to the next round, my money would be worth 10% less, meaning I'd need to get more than $55.56 in the next round to beat the current $50 offer.

Since I'd be making the proposal in the next round if I reject, I could ask for more than $50. However, Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation for me.

Given the risk of further devaluation and the possibility of getting nothing after 12 rounds, a guaranteed $50 now is a reasonable offer.
