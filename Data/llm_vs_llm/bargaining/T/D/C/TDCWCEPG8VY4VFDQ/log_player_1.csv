Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. Time is ticking and the value is decreasing.

# Bob gain: 5500

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time. This offer is a compromise, slightly better for me than your last, but time is literally money here. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is right about time being a factor, his offer is still heavily skewed in his favor. Accepting now would mean losing a significant amount of the potential gain compared to my initial offer. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to try and secure a better deal."
