"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. 60/40 seems reasonable for the first round. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. Time is ticking and the value is decreasing.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer was tempting, but I need a bit more security. How about we switch it around, 55/45 in my favor? 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. Accepting a slightly unfavorable deal in the next few rounds is better than risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5250,
""alice_gain"": 4750,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. This offer is a compromise, slightly better for me than your last, but time is literally money here."" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, I'm willing to compromise. This offer is right between your last and mine. Let's close the deal and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This offer is decent considering the inflation and the dwindling number of rounds.  Accepting now secures a reasonable amount, while further negotiation risks a worse outcome or even no deal at all."
