"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair split. Let's end this quickly and enjoy our winnings! 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Alice is offering me $200,000 (20%) while keeping $800,000 (80%) for herself
2. If I reject, we move to the next round where:
   - I can make my own proposal
   - The money will be worth 10% less to me ($900,000 effective value)
   - The money will be worth 5% less to Alice ($950,000 effective value)
3. This initial offer is quite unfair, giving Alice 4 times what I would get

Given that I can make the next proposal and the inflation penalty isn't too severe for one round, I should reject this unfair offer and propose a more equitable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a strategic offer:

Since we're in round 2:
- The money is worth 90% of original value to me
- The money is worth 95% of original value to Alice

I'll propose a more equitable split, but slightly in my favor since Alice needs to consider that rejecting will cost her 5% more value.

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I propose a more balanced split. Remember that rejecting this will cost you 5% value in the next round, while this split already gives you $450,000. Let's be efficient and close the deal.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Alright Bob, let's try a more reasonable offer. I'm giving up a lot here to make sure we both walk away happy. Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Current offer: $400,000 for me, $600,000 for Alice
2. Due to inflation:
   - My $400,000 is actually worth $324,000 (81% of original value)
   - Alice's $600,000 is worth $541,500 (90.25% of original value)
3. If I reject:
   - Next round money will be worth 71% for me (29% loss)
   - Next round money will be worth 85.5% for Alice (14.5% loss)
4. The offer is more reasonable than the first one
5. Inflation is starting to significantly impact potential future gains
6. The split is now 40/60 instead of the initial 20/80

Given the increasing impact of inflation and the more reasonable split, I should accept this offer. Further negotiation would erode too much value.
