Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your spirit of fairness. However, as time passes each round my share loses 10% of its value. In the interest of avoiding further losses—and keeping things simple—I propose we split the $10000 equally, now. Let’s settle this immediately for the sake of both our benefits. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
