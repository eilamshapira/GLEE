"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer.

Alice is proposing a fair, equal split of $50 for each of us.

Given that:
1. This is a perfectly equal division
2. We're only in the first round
3. The inflation rate for me is 0% per round (so the money's value doesn't decrease for me)
4. I don't know how inflation affects Alice, but it could potentially make her more eager to settle in earlier rounds

This seems like a fair offer that maximizes our joint outcome. There's no guarantee I could get significantly more by rejecting, and we risk running out of rounds if we keep negotiating.
