5500.0,4500.0,"Let's make a fair split with a slight advantage for me as the first mover. If we delay, we both lose value due to inflation.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Given the inflation rates, my offer accounts for the value loss over time. I propose a 60-40 split in my favor to compensate for the higher inflation rate I'm facing. Let's settle this quickly to minimize our losses.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5800.0,4200.0,"Bob, let's be practical. Due to your 20% inflation rate, any further delay hits you harder than me. This 58-42 split gives you $4200 now, which is worth more than a larger amount in the next round. Let's conclude this deal.",Alice,3,

3500.0,6500.0,"Alice, considering the rapid decrease in value due to inflation, especially for me, I propose a 65-35 split. This offer takes into account the significant loss in value I face each round. Let's end this now before our shares become even less valuable.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"Bob, let's be rational. Your $4000 now is worth more than $6500 in the next round due to your 20% inflation rate. Any further delay will severely diminish both our shares, but yours more drastically. This is a fair offer considering our different inflation rates - let's conclude this now.",Alice,5,
