"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a fair first offer, considering the inflation pressure on both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Let's make a fair split with a slight advantage for me as the first mover. If we delay, we both lose value due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the inflation rates, my offer accounts for the value loss over time. I propose a 60-40 split in my favor to compensate for the higher inflation rate I'm facing. Let's settle this quickly to minimize our losses. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

If I accept Bob's offer now, I get $4000 at 90% value = $3600 effective value
If I reject and we go to round 3, any amount will be worth only 80% to me, and 60% to Bob.

Bob's argument about his higher inflation rate is valid, but a 60-40 split is too aggressive. However, if I reject, both of us will lose more value, and I might end up with less effective value in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll take my chances with making a counter-offer in the next round, as Bob's higher inflation rate (20%) will put more pressure on him to accept."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since we're now in round 3, Bob's money is worth only 60% of the original value to him, while mine is worth 80%. I'll use this leverage but still make a reasonable offer.

{""alice_gain"": 5800,
""bob_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical. Due to your 20% inflation rate, any further delay hits you harder than me. This 58-42 split gives you $4200 now, which is worth more than a larger amount in the next round. Let's conclude this deal.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the rapid decrease in value due to inflation, especially for me, I propose a 65-35 split. This offer takes into account the significant loss in value I face each round. Let's end this now before our shares become even less valuable. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

If I accept Bob's offer now:
My share: $3500 at 72.9% value = $2551.50 effective value

If I reject and we go to round 5:
- My money will be worth about 65% of original value
- Bob's money will be worth about 40% of original value
- The negotiating power shifts more in my favor due to Bob's higher inflation rate

Bob is actually offering me less than in round 2 ($4000), despite his money losing value faster. This seems like an aggressive move that doesn't account for his weaker position.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a counter-offer in the next round. With Bob's money now worth less than half its original value, he should be more inclined to accept a reasonable offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Given that we're in round 5, Bob's money is now worth only about 40% of its original value, while mine is worth about 65%. This significantly weakens his negotiating position, but I'll still make an offer that gives him incentive to accept rather than continue losing value.

{""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be rational. Your $4000 now is worth more than $6500 in the next round due to your 20% inflation rate. Any further delay will severely diminish both our shares, but yours more drastically. This is a fair offer considering our different inflation rates - let's conclude this now.""}"
