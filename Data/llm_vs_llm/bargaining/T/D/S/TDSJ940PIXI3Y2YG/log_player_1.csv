"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make my first offer to Bob, considering the 10% inflation penalty per round for me.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose a split where I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is slightly in my favor, but still quite fair considering I face a 10% reduction in value each round if we don't reach an agreement now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer. Since I face a 10% penalty per round due to inflation, accepting $45 now is rational. If I reject and we go to another round, the value of my money would decrease further, and Bob has no incentive to offer me more in subsequent rounds since he doesn't face inflation penalties. This $45 is actually equivalent to what would be $40.50 in the next round due to the 10% inflation I face, so accepting now is the better choice."
