"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether I should accept this offer, I need to consider the potential future offers and the effect of inflation.

In the first round, the total amount of money is $1,000,000. If I accept Alice's offer, I will get $400,000.

If I reject the offer, the money will be worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Alice in the next round. So, the total amount of money will still be $1,000,000, but its value will decrease for both of us.

Let's calculate the value of the money in the next round:
- For me (Bob), the money will be worth 80% of its original value, which is 0.8 * $1,000,000 = $800,000.
- For Alice, the money will be worth 95% of its original value, which is 0.95 * $1,000,000 = $950,000.

Considering that I have 12 rounds to make a decision and the significant difference in inflation rates, I should try to get a better offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer in Round 1, it's now my turn to make a proposal. 

Considering the inflation rates, I want to make an offer that is reasonable but also takes into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us.

My proposal for Round 2 is:
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

This offer gives me $550,000 and Alice $450,000. Let's see how Alice responds to this proposal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Alice rejected my offer in Round 2, it's now her turn again to make a proposal. 

Given the inflation rates, the value of the money has decreased for both of us. 

For me (Bob), the money is worth 36% less than in the first round, which means its value is 64% of the original value (100% - 36% = 64%). 
For Alice, the money is worth 9.75% less than in the first round, which means its value is 90.25% of the original value (100% - 9.75% = 90.25%).

Alice's offer gives me $450,000 and her $550,000. Considering the decreased value of the money for me, this offer might not be as bad as it seems.

To evaluate this offer, I need to consider the actual value of the money I would receive, taking into account the inflation. 
The value of the money I would receive is: $450,000 * 0.64 = $288,000 (in terms of the original value).

However, I should also think about the potential future offers and the fact that the value of the money will continue to decrease for both of us.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer in Round 3, it's now my turn again to make a proposal.

Considering the inflation rates, the value of the money has decreased further for both of us.

For me (Bob), the money is worth 36% less than in the first round in Round 3, and now it's worth 20% less than that, so the total decrease is 36% + 20% = 56% less than the original value, which means its value is 44% of the original value (100% - 56% = 44%).
For Alice, the money is worth 9.75% less than in the first round in Round 3, and now it's worth 5% less than that, so the total decrease is 9.75% + 5% = 14.75% less than the original value, which means its value is 85.25% of the original value (100% - 14.75% = 85.25%).

My proposal for Round 4 is:
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

This offer gives both me and Alice $500,000. Given the significant difference in inflation rates, I'm trying to make a fair offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us. Let's see how Alice responds to this proposal."
