"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to avoid further rounds (which would only hurt my side with inflation), I propose that you get the whole $100 now. I know it’s not ideal for me, but the waiting cost for me is steep – and I know you’re in no hurry. Please accept this offer so we can wrap up quickly. 
# Bob gain: 100 
# Alice gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
