"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to agree quickly due to inflation affecting our gains.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think a 55-45 split in my favor is fair this round. Let's agree quickly to minimize the impact of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer since even with 10% inflation affecting my gains, I can still make a better offer in the next round. The inflation impact on my $45 would make it worth $40.5, which is less than my initial proposal. Let's see if we can reach a more balanced agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Bob, let's meet in the middle. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. With inflation affecting my gains, this is actually less than what I initially proposed. Let's not waste more rounds and risk further value loss.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's go for a 50-50 split this round. It's fair and equal, and we can both avoid further loss due to inflation. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this 50-50 split. With 27.1% inflation affecting my gains, my $50 would be worth about $36.45, while waiting for another round would mean even more value loss. This is a fair compromise given the circumstances."
