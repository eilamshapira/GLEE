550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. This is fair considering I'm making the first offer, and we both need to be mindful of inflation. If we keep going back and forth, we'll both lose significantly due to the 20% inflation on my end. Let's make a deal now and both walk away with a good amount.",Alice,1,

475000.0,525000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I believe a 52.5/47.5 split in my favor is more equitable given the inflation impact on my side. Let's settle this now to avoid further loss due to inflation. What do you think?",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
525000.0,475000.0,"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but since inflation is affecting me at 20% per round, I need to ensure I get enough value. This 52.5/47.5 split in my favor is fair considering we're now in round 3 and I've already lost significant value. Let's avoid further losses for both of us by agreeing now - we're both still getting substantial amounts.",Alice,3,

450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Alice, I see your point about inflation, but it's hitting me harder at 36% per round. A 55/45 split in my favor seems fair now, considering the significant value I've already lost. Let's agree on this to minimize further losses for both of us. What do you say?",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Bob, I see we're both claiming high inflation rates. Let's meet in the middle with a 50/50 split. This is completely fair and we're now in round 5 - we've both lost significant value already. I'm taking a compromise position here. If we keep going back and forth, we'll both end up with much less due to inflation. A 50/50 split right now maximizes our combined outcome.",Alice,5,

425000.0,575000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but with inflation now at 59.04% for me, I need a bit more to make up for the loss. A 57.5/42.5 split in my favor seems reasonable at this point. We're both losing value rapidly, so let's settle this now to ensure we both walk away with something substantial. What do you think?",Bob,6,
