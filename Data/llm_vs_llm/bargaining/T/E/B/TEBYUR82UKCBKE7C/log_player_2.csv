"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. This is fair considering I'm making the first offer, and we both need to be mindful of inflation. If we keep going back and forth, we'll both lose significantly due to the 20% inflation on my end. Let's make a deal now and both walk away with a good amount.

# Alice gain: 550000

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but since inflation is affecting me at 20% per round, I need to ensure I get enough value. This 52.5/47.5 split in my favor is fair considering we're now in round 3 and I've already lost significant value. Let's avoid further losses for both of us by agreeing now - we're both still getting substantial amounts.

# Alice gain: 525000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're both claiming high inflation rates. Let's meet in the middle with a 50/50 split. This is completely fair and we're now in round 5 - we've both lost significant value already. I'm taking a compromise position here. If we keep going back and forth, we'll both end up with much less due to inflation. A 50/50 split right now maximizes our combined outcome. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000

A 57.5/42.5 split in my favor seems reasonable at this point. We're both losing value rapidly, so let's settle this now to ensure we both walk away with something substantial. What do you think?""
