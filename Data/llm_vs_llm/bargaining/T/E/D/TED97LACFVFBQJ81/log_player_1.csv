"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair - I'm offering you a generous 40%. If we delay, inflation will hurt both of us, especially you. This is a good deal.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a fair 50-50 split. This is better for both of us than continuing negotiations with inflation eating away at the value. Let's make this deal now and both walk away happy. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think this through:
* If I accept now, I get $5000 with 5% inflation = $4750 real value
* If I reject, we go to round 3 where I can make an offer, but my share will be worth another 5% less
* Further delays mean even more value lost for both of us
* A 50-50 split is objectively fair
* While I might be able to negotiate a slightly better deal, the inflation penalty makes quick agreement valuable
