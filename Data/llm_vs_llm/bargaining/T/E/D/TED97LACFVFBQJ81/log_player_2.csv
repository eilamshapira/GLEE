"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair - I'm offering you a generous 40%. If we delay, inflation will hurt both of us, especially you. This is a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $4,000 (40%) while keeping $6,000 (60%)
2. If I reject, next round I can make a counter-offer
3. However, inflation will reduce my money's value by 10% next round
4. My $4,000 now is better than $4,000 in future rounds due to higher inflation on my side
5. But the split isn't quite fair - I should be able to get closer to 50%

Given that I have worse inflation (10% vs 5%), any delays hurt me more than Alice. However, I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round, even accounting for inflation.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split while acknowledging the inflation pressure:

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. This is better for both of us than continuing negotiations with inflation eating away at the value. Let's make this deal now and both walk away happy.""}"
