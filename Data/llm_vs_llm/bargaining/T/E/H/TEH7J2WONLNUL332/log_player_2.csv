"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Since the money doesn't lose value for me with each round, but it loses 10% value for Alice each round, I have a strategic advantage in waiting. If I reject and make a counter-offer, Alice will have more incentive to accept since her share would be worth less in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money loses 10% of its value for Alice each round but keeps the same value for me, I should offer her a bit less than 50 to reflect this discount factor, but still make it attractive enough for her to accept rather than reject and let the game proceed to round 3.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'd like to suggest this division because it's fair considering the time pressure that affects Alice. If she rejects, her share in the next round would be worth even less to her due to the 10% inflation she faces."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to analyze this situation strategically. Alice has now offered me $60, which is better than my previous offer of $55 for myself. I'm not affected by inflation, so the full $60 keeps its value for me.

For Alice, her $40 is already worth approximately 19% less than in the first round. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, her money would depreciate further (by about 27% from the original value).

This is actually a good offer for me, as I'm getting more than half of the money, and if we continue further rounds, the strategic advantage shifts even more in my favor.
