"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm proposing a more balanced split where you still get the majority. This is fair considering we both lose if we drag this out for all 12 rounds. With inflation affecting me by 10% each round, it's in my interest to resolve this quickly, and I imagine you have similar concerns. Let's find a reasonable middle ground now rather than risking further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
