"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I believe a fair start is for me to get the majority, but I am offering you a decent amount. Take it or leave it! Let's get this over with. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer carefully, given the constraints of the game.

Alice is offering me $1,000 out of $10,000, which means she would get $9,000 (90% of the total). While this is a small portion for me, I need to remember that inflation decreases the money's value by 10% each round for me.

If I reject this offer, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but the total will be worth 10% less to me. So effectively, the maximum I could get in round 2 would be worth 90% of the current value.

This first offer gives me only 10% of the pot, which seems quite low. I believe I can make a more balanced counter-offer in the next round that would still be better for both of us despite the inflation.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I need to make a strategic offer that accounts for inflation while being persuasive to Alice. Since the money loses 10% value for me each round but I don't know how inflation affects Alice, I should propose a fair division that encourages early agreement.

{""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm proposing a more balanced split where you still get the majority. This is fair considering we both lose if we drag this out for all 12 rounds. With inflation affecting me by 10% each round, it's in my interest to resolve this quickly, and I imagine you have similar concerns. Let's find a reasonable middle ground now rather than risking further devaluation.""}"
