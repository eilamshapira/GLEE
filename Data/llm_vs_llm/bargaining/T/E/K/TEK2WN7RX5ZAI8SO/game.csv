60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest we split the money with 60 for me and 40 for you. Given that I face a 5% inflation penalty per round, this split is fair as it accounts for the decreasing value I'd receive if we delay.",Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, considering the inflation affecting us differently, I propose a split of 55 for me and 45 for you. This accounts for the 10% decrease in value I face each round, and I believe it's a fair compromise given our different inflation rates.",Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I can see we both have inflation concerns. I'm now facing a 10% cumulative inflation penalty, while you're at 20%. Let's meet in the middle with 55 for me and 45 for you. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our inflation concerns while being close to a 50/50 split.",Alice,3,
