"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest we split the money with 60 for me and 40 for you. Given that I face a 5% inflation penalty per round, this split is fair as it accounts for the decreasing value I'd receive if we delay.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation affecting us differently, I propose a split of 55 for me and 45 for you. This accounts for the 10% decrease in value I face each round, and I believe it's a fair compromise given our different inflation rates. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I can see we both have inflation concerns. I'm now facing a 10% cumulative inflation penalty, while you're at 20%. Let's meet in the middle with 55 for me and 45 for you. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our inflation concerns while being close to a 50/50 split.""}"
