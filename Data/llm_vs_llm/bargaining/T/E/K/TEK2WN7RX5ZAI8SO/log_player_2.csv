"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest we split the money with 60 for me and 40 for you. Given that I face a 5% inflation penalty per round, this split is fair as it accounts for the decreasing value I'd receive if we delay. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering the inflation affecting us differently, I propose a split of 55 for me and 45 for you. This accounts for the 10% decrease in value I face each round, and I believe it's a fair compromise given our different inflation rates.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I can see we both have inflation concerns. I'm now facing a 10% cumulative inflation penalty, while you're at 20%. Let's meet in the middle with 55 for me and 45 for you. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our inflation concerns while being close to a 50/50 split. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
