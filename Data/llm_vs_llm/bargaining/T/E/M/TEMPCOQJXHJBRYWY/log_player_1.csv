"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'd like to propose a fair 50/50 split of the $10,000. Agreeing now prevents any discounting on my side and simplifies things for both of us. Looking forward to your response!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the inflation affecting me, I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This way, we both still get a fair share while accounting for the economic conditions on my side. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you accounting for the current economic conditions. Although a slight reduction on my side isn’t ideal, I understand the discounting effect that comes with each round. Considering that further rounds would devalue my share even more, I think it’s best to close the deal now. I accept your offer.""}"
