The offer of $4000 is worth $4000 * 0.95 = $3800 to me.

I don't think this is a fair offer, so I will reject it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, the total value of the money is now $10,000 * (0.95)^2 = $9025 to me.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, the total value of the money is now $10,000 * (0.95)^4 = $8145.53 to me, but for simplicity, I'll use the original $10,000 and adjust my share accordingly.

Since the money I gain is worth 14.26% less, I'll aim to get a bit more to compensate for the inflation.
