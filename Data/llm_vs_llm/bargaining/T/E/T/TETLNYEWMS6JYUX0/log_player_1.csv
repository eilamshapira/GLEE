"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I'll analyze Bob's offer, taking inflation into account:

*   **My Perspective (Alice):** My money is now worth 80% of its original value.
*   **Bob's Perspective:** His money is now worth 95% of its original value.

Here's my decision:

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here is my offer for Round 3, taking into account that my money is worth 20% less than in round 1, so 80% of its original value. Bob's money is worth 10% less than in round 1, so 90% of its original value.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze Bob's offer in Round 4, considering the accumulated inflation:

*   **My Perspective (Alice):** My money is worth 100% - 48.8% = 51.2% of its original value.
*   **Bob's Perspective:** His money is worth 100% - 14.26% = 85.74% of its original value.

Given these inflation rates, I need to decide whether accepting $4000 now (worth 51.2% of the original $4000) is better than continuing. I would reject the offer if the future round is expected to give me a lot more than this. Since this is the fourth round already, my expected gain in the next round should be significantly higher to make me reject this offer.

Here's my decision:

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's Round 5. I have to adjust my offer again. Now, the money I receive is worth less and less. My money is worth 30.72% of its original value (100% - 20% - 20% - 20% - 20%). Bob's money is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```"
