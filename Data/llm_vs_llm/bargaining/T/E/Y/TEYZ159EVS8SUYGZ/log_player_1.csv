Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was tempting, but the inflation hits me harder. I need a bit more to make it worthwhile. This offer is still generous to you considering the long game ahead. 
# Alice gain: 5600 
# Bob gain: 4400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
