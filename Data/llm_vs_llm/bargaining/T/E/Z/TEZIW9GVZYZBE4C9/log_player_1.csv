"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a strategic first offer. Since Bob's money loses value faster (20% vs 10% per round), he has more incentive to accept early. However, I don't want to be too aggressive and risk rejection.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which gives Bob a significant portion while still being advantageous to me. This is a reasonable starting point that acknowledges both our positions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept now:
   * I get $4500 at 90% value = $4050 effective value
   * Bob gets $5500 at 80% value = $4400 effective value

2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make a new offer
   * But money will be worth even less (20% less for Bob, 10% less for me)
   * We risk further devaluation of the total amount

Given that:
- The current split is relatively fair when accounting for inflation
- The risk of further devaluation is significant
- I still get a substantial amount in real terms
- Further negotiation might lead to worse outcomes for both
