"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

1. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000 (40%)
2. If I reject, we move to the next round where:
   * My money will be worth 20% less
   * Her money will be worth 10% less
   * I get to make the next offer

$4,000 now is better than $5,000 that's worth 20% less in the next round ($4,000). Plus, if we keep going back and forth, we risk getting nothing after 12 rounds.

However, given that I have less inflation pressure than Alice (20% vs 10%), I have some negotiating power. I think I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I should propose something that:
1. Is better for me than her initial offer
2. Is still reasonable enough for Alice to accept, considering she faces 10% inflation per round
3. Takes into account that if she rejects, she'll get to make the next offer

I'll propose a more balanced split, slightly in my favor:

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

This gives me 55% of the total, which is better than the 40% she offered, but still leaves her with a substantial amount. Given that her next round's money would be worth 10% less, this should be attractive enough for her to accept."
