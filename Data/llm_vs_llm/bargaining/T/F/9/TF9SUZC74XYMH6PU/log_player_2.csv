Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my preferred split, the significant inflation working against her makes me believe I can secure a better deal in the next round."

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** 

The inflation is starting to significantly impact my potential gains. While I pushed for a higher amount in the previous rounds, accepting a 60/40 split at this stage is better than risking a worse outcome later due to the rapidly decreasing value."
