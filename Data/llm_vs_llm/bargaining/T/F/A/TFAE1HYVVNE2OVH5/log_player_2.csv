Let's wait for a better offer next round, considering the inflation effect is not drastic and I have a better chance to get more in the next round."

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a fair deal 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The offer is still not fair considering the inflation effect on my side. Let's try to get a better deal in the next round."

Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 5400,
  ""alice_gain"": 4600,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this offer gives us both a fair share.""
}
```

This offer takes into account the 36% inflation I'm experiencing, so it should be more acceptable to both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Inflation is taking its toll, this is a reasonable split 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Given the significant impact of inflation, accepting this offer is better than risking a further decrease in the value of the money I receive in the next round."
