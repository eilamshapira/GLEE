"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'm offering you $400000. This ensures we both get a substantial amount and avoids the risk of walking away with nothing. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While a fair split sounds good, I'm willing to gamble a bit in the hopes of getting a larger share. The inflation effect isn't too significant in the early rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I appreciate the fair split offer, but I'm aiming a bit higher. How about we reverse the amounts? You still get a good deal.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your perspective, but let's meet in the middle. I'm offering you $450000 this time. This way, we both get a fair share and minimize the risk of losing it all. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is moving in the right direction, but it's still too early, and the offer isn't good enough.  I'm willing to take a slightly bigger risk to try and secure a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Okay, let's try this. I'm willing to take a slightly smaller piece of the pie than my last offer. This offer gets us closer to a deal and avoids more rounds of inflation."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly to avoid further inflation risks. This ensures neither of us is at a disadvantage. It's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is better than risking further inflation and potentially ending up with nothing."
