"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it equally. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage and we both walk away with a fair share before inflation reduces the value further. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept this offer because:
1. It's a fair 50-50 split
2. If I reject, the next round's money will be worth even less due to 5% inflation
3. Getting $500,000 now is better than risking a lower real value in future rounds
4. Bob's reasoning is sound and demonstrates fairness"
