"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll send an offer to Bob for dividing the $100.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose that I (Alice) get $55 and Bob gets $45. Since inflation affects Bob more than me, it makes sense for us to reach an agreement sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
