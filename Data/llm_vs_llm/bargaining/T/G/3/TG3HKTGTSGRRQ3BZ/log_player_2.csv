"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'd like to propose an even split â€“ $50 each. Accepting now means we both avoid the 5% depreciation on my side in later rounds. I believe a fair early agreement benefits us both. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
