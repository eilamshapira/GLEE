"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer isn't fair to me. She's taking 60% while giving me only 40%, even though I have less inflation pressure than she does (10% vs 20%). I should reject and make a counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more equitable offer considering our different inflation rates.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split, which is fair and reasonable. Since you face higher inflation (20% vs my 10%), accepting this now would be better than continuing to later rounds where both our shares would be worth less."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has only slightly improved her offer (from 400k to 420k for me), which still isn't fair considering inflation. The money is now worth 19% less to me and 36% less to Alice, so her inflation problem is getting worse faster than mine. I should reject and make a better counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a strategic offer that accounts for our inflation rates and the value of resolving this sooner.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

Since we're now in round 4, inflation has significantly reduced the value for both of us, but it's affecting you more severely (your 20% vs my 10% per round). This 55-45 split is fair because it accounts for your higher inflation pressure. Accepting now would be better for you than continuing to later rounds where your share would be worth much less."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice continues to only incrementally improve her offers (now 440k for me), but with inflation rapidly reducing the value for both of us, especially for her (59% reduction for Alice vs 34% for me), we're both losing by continuing this negotiation. Still, I can make one more counter-offer that might be more appealing.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to make a compelling offer that Alice will accept, considering the significant inflation we're both facing.

{""bob_gain"": 530000, ""alice_gain"": 470000}

I'm proposing a 53-47 split in our favor. This is a meaningful compromise from my previous offer. At this point, inflation has severely impacted both of us, but you're suffering more (59% reduction for you vs 34% for me). If we continue to later rounds, we both stand to lose much more. This division recognizes your need to conclude this negotiation while still being fair to me."
