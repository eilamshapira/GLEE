"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a reasonable first offer, considering that I need to account for inflation being higher on my side (20%) compared to Bob's (5%). I should offer a somewhat larger share to myself to compensate for this risk.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'd like to accompany this offer with the explanation: ""I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, considering the higher inflation rate I face if we delay."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept Bob's offer now:
   * I get $4500, but with 20% inflation = $3600 effective value
   * Bob gets $5500, but with 5% inflation = $5225 effective value

2. If I reject and make a new offer next round:
   * Money will be worth even less (40% less for me, 10% less for Bob)
   * This significantly reduces my negotiating power

Since further delays will hurt me more than Bob due to the asymmetric inflation rates, and the current offer still gives me a significant portion of the money, I should accept this offer rather than risk further devaluation.
