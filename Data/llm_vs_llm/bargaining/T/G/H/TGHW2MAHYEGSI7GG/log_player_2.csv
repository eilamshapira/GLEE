"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a fair 60-40 split considering the inflation rates. This way we both get a good portion, and we don't risk losing value in later rounds. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000
2. If I reject, we move to next round where:
   - My money will be worth 20% less
   - Her money will be worth 5% less
   - But I get to make the next offer

While 40% isn't exactly equal, Alice makes a valid point about the inflation rates. I lose value much faster than she does (20% vs 5%). If I reject and we go another round, my $4,000 would effectively become $3,200, while her $6,000 would become $5,700.

Given the significant difference in our inflation rates and the risk of further devaluation, this is actually a reasonable first offer.
