7143.0,2857.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we split the $10000 so that I receive $7143 and you receive $2857. Given that waiting devalues the money by 10% for me and 20% for you each round, this offer reflects our best alternative in an endless bargaining game. I believe this is fair under our respective time‐preferences—please consider accepting it.",Alice,1,
