Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7143, ""bob_gain"": 2857, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split the $10,000 so that I receive $7,143 and you receive $2,857. Given that waiting devalues the money by 10% for me and 20% for you each round, this offer reflects our best alternative in an endless bargaining game. I believe this is fair under our respective time‐preferences—please consider accepting it.""}"
