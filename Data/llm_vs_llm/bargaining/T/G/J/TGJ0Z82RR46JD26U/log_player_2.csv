"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the $10000 so that I receive $7143 and you receive $2857. Given that waiting devalues the money by 10% for me and 20% for you each round, this offer reflects our best alternative in an endless bargaining game. I believe this is fair under our respective time‐preferences—please consider accepting it. 
# Bob gain: 2857 
# Alice gain: 7143 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Current offer: I get $2857, Alice gets $7143

2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make an offer
   * But the money will be worth 20% less to me and 10% less to Alice
   * Total value next round for me: $10000 × 0.8 = $8000
   * Total value next round for Alice: $10000 × 0.9 = $9000

3. Even if I make a counter-offer next round, Alice could reject it, leading to further devaluation in subsequent rounds.

4. While the split isn't equal (28.57% vs 71.43%), Alice's reasoning about the time preferences affecting the equilibrium is actually mathematically sound. Due to the asymmetric devaluation rates, this split approximates the game theory equilibrium.

5. Any delay would significantly reduce my potential gains due to the steep 20% devaluation rate I face.

Given these factors, particularly the severe devaluation rate I face and the game theory behind the offer, I should accept this offer.
