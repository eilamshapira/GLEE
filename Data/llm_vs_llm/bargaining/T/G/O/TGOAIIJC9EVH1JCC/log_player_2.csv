"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it evenly, no need to wait 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. With a 10% reduction each round for me, if I reject now and propose next round, any amount I get will already be worth 10% less. The offer of $500,000 is fair and getting it now at full value is better than risking a lower effective amount in future rounds, even if I could potentially negotiate for more.
