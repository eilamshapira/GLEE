5500.0,4500.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that accounts for our different inflation rates. Since my inflation is higher (10% vs your 5%), I'm suggesting I get $5500 and you get $4500. This way we both benefit from reaching an agreement now rather than going through multiple rounds of negotiation where we'd both lose value.",Alice,1,
