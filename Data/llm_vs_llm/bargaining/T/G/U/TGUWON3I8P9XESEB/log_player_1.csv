"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer that considers our different inflation rates.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that accounts for our different inflation rates. Since my inflation is higher (10% vs your 5%), I'm suggesting I get $5,500 and you get $4,500. This way we both benefit from reaching an agreement now rather than going through multiple rounds of negotiation where we'd both lose value.""
