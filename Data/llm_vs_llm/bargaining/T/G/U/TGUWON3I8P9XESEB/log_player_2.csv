"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that accounts for our different inflation rates. Since my inflation is higher (10% vs your 5%), I'm suggesting I get $5500 and you get $4500. This way we both benefit from reaching an agreement now rather than going through multiple rounds of negotiation where we'd both lose value. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
