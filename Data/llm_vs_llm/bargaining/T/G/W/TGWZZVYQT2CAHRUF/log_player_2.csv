"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice's offer gives me $1000, it's a very small portion of the total amount. Since this is just the first round and I have several more opportunities to negotiate a better deal, I'll reject this offer. The 5% inflation per round will impact future value, but there's still room to negotiate for a more equitable distribution.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more balanced distribution that accounts for both our interests, while acknowledging the inflation factor I face.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I believe a 50-50 split is fair and equitable for both of us. This way we both receive an equal share of the money. Since I face 5% inflation with each round, it's beneficial for both of us to reach an agreement soon rather than prolonging negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Alice is experiencing much higher inflation (36%) than I am (9.75%). This dramatically changes the negotiation dynamics. Her $8000 is worth significantly less to her now, while my inflation is more modest.

However, $2000 is still a relatively small portion of the total amount. Given that we still have several rounds left and knowing that Alice's inflation rate is much higher than mine, I believe I can negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Now that I understand Alice is facing much higher inflation (36% so far compared to my 9.75%), I can make a more strategic offer. Since time pressure affects Alice more severely, I should propose something that acknowledges this dynamic while improving my position.

{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000}

I'm offering you $6000, which is a significant portion of the total amount. Given your higher inflation rate (36% already), this deal becomes more favorable for you to accept now rather than later. This is a fair compromise that considers our different inflation situations and allows us both to walk away with a substantial amount."
