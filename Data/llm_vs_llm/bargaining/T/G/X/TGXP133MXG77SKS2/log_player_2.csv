"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a significant gain. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully, taking into account the 20% inflation penalty per round if I reject.

Alice is offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000 total. If I reject, we move to the next round where I can make an offer, but the money will be worth 20% less to me. This means in the next round, the total value to me would effectively be $800,000 rather than $1,000,000.

If I reject now and propose a 50-50 split in the next round ($500,000 each), even if Alice accepts, I'd get $500,000 that's worth 20% less to me, which is equivalent to $400,000 of current value - the same as Alice's current offer.

Any delay could reduce my earnings due to inflation, and there's no guarantee Alice would accept my counter-offer.
