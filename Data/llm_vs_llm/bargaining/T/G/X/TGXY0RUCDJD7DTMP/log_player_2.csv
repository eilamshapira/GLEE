"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share, let's agree 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering me $40 while taking $60 for herself, claiming this is a ""fair share."" This doesn't seem completely fair as it's not an equal 50-50 split. 

However, I need to consider the inflation penalties. If I reject and we go to the next round, the money will be worth 10% less to me and 5% less to Alice. This gives Alice an advantage in later rounds, as her money devalues more slowly than mine.

If I reject and propose a 50-50 split in the next round, I'd get $50 but it would be worth only $45 to me due to 10% inflation. And Alice might reject that offer anyway, leading to further rounds and more inflation.

I think accepting $40 now is better than risking further devaluation in later rounds.
