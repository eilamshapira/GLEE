50.0,50.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair 50/50 split. Since I face a 10% inflation penalty for each passing round, delaying this deal would reduce the value for me. This offer gives us both equal amounts while maximizing our total value.",Alice,1,

40.0,60.0,"Hi Alice, considering you face 10% inflation per round, this offer of $40 now is worth more to you than $50 in the next round (which would be worth $45 to you). This is a fair offer taking into account our different inflation situations, and I suggest we conclude the deal now to maximize our combined value.",Bob,2,

45.0,55.0,"Bob, I understand the inflation concerns, but a 40/60 split is too unbalanced. This 45/55 offer is fair considering my inflation penalty. If this round passes, I'd receive less than 45 in effective value next round, and you'd face making a new offer under time pressure. This compromise maximizes our combined utility while being fair to both of us.",Alice,3,
