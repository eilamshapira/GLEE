"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer that's fair but also protects my interests given the inflation penalty I face.

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair 50/50 split. Since I face a 10% inflation penalty for each passing round, delaying this deal would reduce the value for me. This offer gives us both equal amounts while maximizing our total value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering you face 10% inflation per round, this offer of $40 now is worth more to you than $50 in the next round (which would be worth $45 to you). This is a fair offer taking into account our different inflation situations, and I suggest we conclude the deal now to maximize our combined value. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 45, 
""bob_gain"": 55, 
""message"": ""Bob, I understand the inflation concerns, but a 40/60 split is too unbalanced. This 45/55 offer is fair considering my inflation penalty. If this round passes, I'd receive less than 45 in effective value next round, and you'd face making a new offer under time pressure. This compromise maximizes our combined utility while being fair to both of us.""}"
