"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair 50/50 split. Since I face a 10% inflation penalty for each passing round, delaying this deal would reduce the value for me. This offer gives us both equal amounts while maximizing our total value. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice revealed she faces 10% inflation per round
2. I face 0% inflation, so waiting doesn't hurt me
3. Alice's willingness to split 50/50 shows she's trying to be fair
4. However, given that I don't lose value but she does, I could potentially get a better deal by rejecting
5. If I reject, in the next round:
   - I can propose a split that gives me more
   - Alice would be facing a 10% loss on whatever she gets
   - This makes her more likely to accept a less favorable deal

While 50/50 is fair in a vacuum, given our asymmetric inflation positions, I can likely get a better deal by rejecting and making my own proposal next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Given that Alice faces 10% inflation per round and I don't, I'll propose a split that's slightly in my favor but still reasonable enough that she should accept rather than risk another round of inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering you face 10% inflation per round, this offer of $40 now is worth more to you than $50 in the next round (which would be worth $45 to you). This is a fair offer taking into account our different inflation situations, and I suggest we conclude the deal now to maximize our combined value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation concerns, but a 40/60 split is too unbalanced. This 45/55 offer is fair considering my inflation penalty. If this round passes, I'd receive less than 45 in effective value next round, and you'd face making a new offer under time pressure. This compromise maximizes our combined utility while being fair to both of us. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice's current offer gives me $55, which is better than the initial 50/50 split
2. If I reject:
   - Next round I can make another offer
   - Alice will face 29% inflation (compounded from current 19%)
   - This means $45 would be worth only about $32 to her next round
   - She would likely be forced to accept an even less favorable deal

However:
1. We've already gone through 3 rounds
2. Alice has shown she's willing to reject unfair offers despite inflation
3. $55 is a good improvement from the initial $50 offer
4. Continuing to push might lead to a breakdown in negotiations

Given that I've already improved my position and have a solid offer, I'll accept rather than risk further rounds.
