"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, if we delay the agreement we both lose as the money is worth 20% less each round. In the next round, you'll have the chance to propose but you'll be stuck with an 80$ pie. So, let's avoid the loss now—I propose I receive $20 and you receive $80. I believe this is fair given the discounting, and it’s in your best interest to accept now. 
# Bob gain: 80 
# Alice gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
