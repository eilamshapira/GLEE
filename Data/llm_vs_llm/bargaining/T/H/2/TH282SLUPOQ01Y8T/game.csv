7917.0,2083.0,"Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I take $7917 and you get $2083. Given that every round of delay costs me 5% and you 20% of the pie’s value, this division reflects the differing costs of waiting. Accepting now secures your share at a higher absolute value, so let's settle immediately.",Alice,1,

4000.0,6000.0,"Considering the significant loss I incur with each round, I'm willing to settle for a larger share to offset future losses. This division still leaves you with a substantial amount, and accepting now will minimize your own loss due to waiting.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, your offer would give me an effective value of about $3800 (since 4000 gets discounted by 5%), which is well below what I can expect if I get to propose in the next round given the equilibrium outcomes. I believe waiting out for round 3, despite the further discount, will allow me to secure a division much more favorable to me. Therefore, I'll have to reject your proposal.",Alice,2,reject
8333.0,1667.0,"Hi Bob, in round 3 I'm offering you $1667 and keeping $8333. With the current discount factors (5% per round for me and 20% for you), if you reject and wait for round 4 you'll be able to propose but your effective payoff would drop to roughly $1067. My offer gives you an almost identical effective value now (0.64 * $1667 ≈ $1067) while saving both of us further losses from delay. I believe this is a fair compromise given our respective discount rates. Looking forward to settling this promptly.",Alice,3,
