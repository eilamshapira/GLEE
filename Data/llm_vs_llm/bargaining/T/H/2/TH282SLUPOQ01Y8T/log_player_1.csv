"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7917, ""bob_gain"": 2083, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I take $7,917 and you get $2,083. Given that every round of delay costs me 5% and you 20% of the pie’s value, this division reflects the differing costs of waiting. Accepting now secures your share at a higher absolute value, so let's settle immediately.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the significant loss I incur with each round, I'm willing to settle for a larger share to offset future losses. This division still leaves you with a substantial amount, and accepting now will minimize your own loss due to waiting. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, your offer would give me an effective value of about $3,800 (since 4,000 gets discounted by 5%), which is well below what I can expect if I get to propose in the next round given the equilibrium outcomes. I believe waiting out for round 3, despite the further discount, will allow me to secure a division much more favorable to me. Therefore, I'll have to reject your proposal.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 8333, ""bob_gain"": 1667, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, in round 3 I'm offering you $1,667 and keeping $8,333. With the current discount factors (5% per round for me and 20% for you), if you reject and wait for round 4 you'll be able to propose but your effective payoff would drop to roughly $1,067. My offer gives you an almost identical effective value now (0.64 * $1,667 ≈ $1,067) while saving both of us further losses from delay. I believe this is a fair compromise given our respective discount rates. Looking forward to settling this promptly.""}"
