"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I take $7917 and you get $2083. Given that every round of delay costs me 5% and you 20% of the pie’s value, this division reflects the differing costs of waiting. Accepting now secures your share at a higher absolute value, so let's settle immediately. 
# Bob gain: 2083 
# Alice gain: 7917 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, 
""alice_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Considering the significant loss I incur with each round, I'm willing to settle for a larger share to offset future losses. This division still leaves you with a substantial amount, and accepting now will minimize your own loss due to waiting.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in round 3 I'm offering you $1667 and keeping $8333. With the current discount factors (5% per round for me and 20% for you), if you reject and wait for round 4 you'll be able to propose but your effective payoff would drop to roughly $1067. My offer gives you an almost identical effective value now (0.64 * $1667 ≈ $1067) while saving both of us further losses from delay. I believe this is a fair compromise given our respective discount rates. Looking forward to settling this promptly. 
# Bob gain: 1667 
# Alice gain: 8333
