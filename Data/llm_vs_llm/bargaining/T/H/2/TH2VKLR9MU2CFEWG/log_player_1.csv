"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a slightly favorable split for myself while keeping it reasonable enough for Bob to accept, avoiding the risk of rejection and counter-offers.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose to take $550,000 while giving Bob $450,000. This is a fairly balanced split with a moderate advantage for me as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is too unfavorable for me. Bob is trying to take advantage by asking for a much larger share (70%). I'll make a more reasonable counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split this time, closer to an even division to increase the chances of acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 510000, ""bob_gain"": 490000}

I'm offering a nearly equal split with just a slight advantage for myself. This should appear more fair to Bob than my previous offer, making it more likely to be accepted and end the negotiation."
