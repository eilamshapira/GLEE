550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest we split the money close to fair – I get $550K and you get $450K. Accepting this division now lets us both avoid further delays and the 10% inflation hit on my share. What do you say?",Alice,1,

1.0,999999.0,"Hi Alice, here's my offer. I propose that I take $999999 and you get $1. I know it might seem steep, but remember: delaying further will only worsen the situation for you because of the inflation hit on your share. Accept now to lock in even a minimal gain, rather than risk ending up with nothing later.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1 is far too low for me, even with inflation. I’m sorry, but I must reject. Let's proceed to the next round.",Alice,2,reject
1.0,999999.0,"Hi Bob, to avoid further delays (and further devaluation of my share), I'm proposing a division where I receive $1 and you receive $999999. I know this might seem extremely generous, but given that any further round will only diminish my portion even more while you remain unaffected, I believe this is the most reasonable offer. I’d appreciate your prompt acceptance to conclude this matter.",Alice,3,
