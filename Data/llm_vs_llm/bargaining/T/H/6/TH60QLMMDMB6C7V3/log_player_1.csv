"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest we split the money close to fair – I get $550K and you get $450K.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, here's my offer. I propose that I take $999999 and you get $1. I know it might seem steep, but remember: delaying further will only worsen the situation for you because of the inflation hit on your share. Accept now to lock in even a minimal gain, rather than risk ending up with nothing later. 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1 is far too low for me, even with inflation. I’m sorry, but I must reject. Let's proceed to the next round.""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 1, ""bob_gain"": 999999, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, to avoid further delays (and further devaluation of my share), I'm proposing a division where I receive $1 and you receive $999,999. I know this might seem extremely generous, but given that any further round will only diminish my portion even more while you remain unaffected, I believe this is the most reasonable offer. I’d appreciate your prompt acceptance to conclude this matter.""}"
