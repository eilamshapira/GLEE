"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest we split the money close to fair – I get $550K and you get $450K. Accepting this division now lets us both avoid further delays and the 10% inflation hit on my share. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 999999, ""alice_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, here's my offer. I propose that I take $999,999 and you get $1. I know it might seem steep, but remember: delaying further will only worsen the situation for you because of the inflation hit on your share. Accept now to lock in even a minimal gain, rather than risk ending up with nothing later.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to avoid further delays (and further devaluation of my share), I'm proposing a division where I receive $1 and you receive $999999. I know this might seem extremely generous, but given that any further round will only diminish my portion even more while you remain unaffected, I believe this is the most reasonable offer. I’d appreciate your prompt acceptance to conclude this matter. 
# Bob gain: 999999 
# Alice gain: 1
