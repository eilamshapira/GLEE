"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each round, I'll try to make a fair offer. Considering the inflation, I'll propose a division that's slightly in my favor to account for the decreasing value.

""alice_gain"": 450000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $430,000 I would gain is actually worth approximately $550,000 (since it's 36% less, 1 - 0.36 = 0.64, so 430000 * 0.64 = 275200 in round 1 value, but to simplify, I will compare the offered amounts directly) in the original value, but due to the inflation, it's less. 

However, since Alice's offer is getting closer to a 50-50 split in terms of the original value and considering the inflation effect on me is harsher, I should consider accepting to avoid further devaluation.
