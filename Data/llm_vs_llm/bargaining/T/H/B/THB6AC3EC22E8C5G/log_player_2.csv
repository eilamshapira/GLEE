"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. This is a $400,000 offer for me and $600,000 for Alice
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 20% less for me in the next round
3. My maximum potential in the next round would be effectively worth $800,000 (1M Ã— 0.8)
4. While I could try to negotiate for more, each round reduces my value by 20%
5. $400,000 is a substantial amount, representing 40% of the total

While I might be able to get a better deal, the risk of value loss and potential for a drawn-out negotiation makes this a reasonable offer. It's not optimal, but it's fair enough considering the time pressure and asymmetric inflation.
