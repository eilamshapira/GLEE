"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair division. I take 60 and you take 40. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me $40 while taking $60 for herself. Due to inflation, if I reject and we move to the next round, any amount I get will be worth 20% less. So in the next round, $40 would only be worth $32 to me.

While the split isn't perfectly equal, getting $40 now is better than risking further rounds with inflation eating into my gains. Plus, I don't know how inflation affects Alice, so I can't be certain she'll be more willing to compromise in later rounds.
