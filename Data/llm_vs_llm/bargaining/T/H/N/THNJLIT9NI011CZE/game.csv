550000.0,450000.0,"I propose a fair split considering inflation rates. You get 450k, I get 550k. This gives us both substantial value while accounting for the higher inflation impact on my side.",Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,"Considering the higher inflation impact on your side, I propose a split that prioritizes immediate value. This offer is more favorable to me, but still provides you with substantial value that won't depreciate as much over time if we continue negotiating.",Bob,2,

600000.0,400000.0,"Let's end this now. Due to two rounds of inflation, my 600k is only worth 480k to me, and your 400k is worth 360k to you. If we continue, we both lose more value. This is better than letting inflation diminish our gains further.",Alice,3,
