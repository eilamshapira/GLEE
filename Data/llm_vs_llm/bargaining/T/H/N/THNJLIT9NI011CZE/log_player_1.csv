Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I propose a fair split considering inflation rates.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the higher inflation impact on your side, I propose a split that prioritizes immediate value. This offer is more favorable to me, but still provides you with substantial value that won't depreciate as much over time if we continue negotiating. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Reasoning (not part of response): With my 20% inflation rate, $400,000 is now worth $320,000 to me, while Bob's $600,000 at 10% inflation is worth $540,000 to him. I can make a better offer in the next round that could benefit both of us more than continuing to let inflation eat away at the total value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's end this now. Due to two rounds of inflation, my 600k is only worth 480k to me, and your 400k is worth 360k to you. If we continue, we both lose more value. This is better than letting inflation diminish our gains further.""}"
