"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split considering inflation rates. You get 450k, I get 550k. This gives us both substantial value while accounting for the higher inflation impact on my side.

# Alice gain: 550000

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Considering the higher inflation impact on your side, I propose a split that prioritizes immediate value. This offer is more favorable to me, but still provides you with substantial value that won't depreciate as much over time if we continue negotiating.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's end this now. Due to two rounds of inflation, my 600k is only worth 480k to me, and your 400k is worth 360k to you. If we continue, we both lose more value. This is better than letting inflation diminish our gains further. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000
