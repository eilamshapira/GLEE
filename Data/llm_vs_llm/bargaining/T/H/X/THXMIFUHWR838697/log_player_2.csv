"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's offer carefully.

She's proposing an equal split of $500,000 for each of us. This is a completely fair division that gives us both the same amount. While I could reject and try to get more in the next round, there's risk in prolonging negotiations, and an equal split is objectively fair.
