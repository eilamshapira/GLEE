"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because if you reject, the money will be worth less to you next round due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's split it evenly this time. A 50-50 split is fair for both of us and avoids losing more value due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think this through:
1. Bob offered a 50-50 split ($5000 each)
2. Due to inflation, Bob's $5000 is actually worth only $4000 to him (20% less)
3. My $5000 still maintains full value
4. If I reject, I can make another offer, but Bob's share will be worth even less next round
5. This is a decent offer considering I get full value of my share
