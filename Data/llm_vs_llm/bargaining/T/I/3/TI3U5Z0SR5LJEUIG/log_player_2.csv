Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 2, taking into account the inflation:

Since this is Round 2, the money is worth 10% less for me. Effectively, my share will be worth 90% of its face value. For Alice, the money is worth 20% less, so Alice's share will be worth 80% of its face value.

My proposal:

  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""alice_gain"": 600000
}
```"
