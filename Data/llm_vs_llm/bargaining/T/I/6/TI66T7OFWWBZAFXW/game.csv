6000.0,4000.0,Let's get this done quickly! I'm offering a slightly better split for me to compensate for the inflation. How does that sound?,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, I appreciate your eagerness to settle matters quickly. However, waiting only hurts you—the longer you wait, the more your share loses its value (5% off each round). Accept my offer now: you'll secure $4000 in today's value, whereas delaying further only diminishes what you get. Let's wrap this up swiftly!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Okay, Bob. Since you rejected my last offer, I'm adjusting my offer slightly to reflect the diminishing value of the money for me. This is still a good deal for you, considering the inflation. Let's try to end this now.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
3700.0,6300.0,"Alice, the longer we drag this out, the more your share loses value. In this round, even though the face value for you is $3700, it’s worth about $3173 in first-round terms. If we move to round 5, you'll face even steeper losses due to inflation. I believe this offer is fair given the circumstances—let's agree now and avoid further erosion of your share!",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, I understand you are trying to take advantage of inflation. I'm offering a 50/50 split to end this, but know that the money is worth even less to me now. Take it or leave it, it's your final chance to get more money than me.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
500.0,9500.0,"Alice, time is not on your side – every round you wait further erodes the real value of your money. If you reject this offer, you'll get to propose next round, but you know full well that my patience (and the full value of my dollars) gives me the upper hand, and you'll end up with almost nothing in real terms. I'm offering you $500 now, which at this round’s inflation is worth about $387 in first-round dollars. This is far better than the pitiful outcome a delay will guarantee. Accept this offer and let's finally put this to rest.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Alright, Bob. You've pushed me this far. I'm offering you a slightly better share now. My money is worth so little to me now that I'm willing to give up a good portion of it to stop the bleeding. Take it or leave it.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
200.0,9800.0,"Alice, the clock is ticking and your money loses value every round—your share is worth 26.49% less than its original value in round 7 and will only shrink further if we delay. I'm offering you $200 now, which, though small, is far better in real terms than the virtually evaporated value you'd get later. This is your best chance to salvage anything of worth. Accept and let's end this now.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"Bob, at this point, I'm trying to salvage what I can before it's completely worthless. I'm giving you the majority now. Accept this, or it's all gone.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
100.0,9900.0,"Alice, this is our final chance. With each round, the real value of your money evaporates further. At this stage, your $100 is worth significantly more in today's terms than waiting any longer would be—delaying now means almost nothing for you. I urge you to accept this final offer and secure what little value remains before it's all gone.",Bob,10,
