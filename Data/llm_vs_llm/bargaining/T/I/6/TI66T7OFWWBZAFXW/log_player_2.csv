Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your eagerness to settle matters quickly. However, waiting only hurts you—the longer you wait, the more your share loses its value (5% off each round). Accept my offer now: you'll secure $4000 in today's value, whereas delaying further only diminishes what you get. Let's wrap this up swiftly!""}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob. Since you rejected my last offer, I'm adjusting my offer slightly to reflect the diminishing value of the money for me. This is still a good deal for you, considering the inflation. Let's try to end this now.

In this round, even though the face value for you is $3700, it’s worth about $3173 in first-round terms. If we move to round 5, you'll face even steeper losses due to inflation. I believe this offer is fair given the circumstances—let's agree now and avoid further erosion of your share!""}"

If you reject this offer, you'll get to propose next round, but you know full well that my patience (and the full value of my dollars) gives me the upper hand, and you'll end up with almost nothing in real terms. I'm offering you $500 now, which at this round’s inflation is worth about $387 in first-round dollars. This is far better than the pitiful outcome a delay will guarantee. Accept this offer and let's finally put this to rest.""}"

I'm offering you $200 now, which, though small, is far better in real terms than the virtually evaporated value you'd get later. This is your best chance to salvage anything of worth.
