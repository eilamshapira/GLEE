"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which gives me $600,000 and Bob $400,000. This is a reasonable offer that gives both of us a substantial amount while acknowledging my position as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer of a 50-50 split. This is a fair and equitable division that gives each of us $500,000. While I tried to get a better deal in my initial offer, an equal split is a reasonable outcome that I'm satisfied with."
