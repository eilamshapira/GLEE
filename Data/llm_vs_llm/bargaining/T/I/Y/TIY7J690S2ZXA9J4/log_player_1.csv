Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"":70,""bob_gain"":30,""message"":""Let's split it fairly. I take 70%, you take 30%. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I'll take $60, you get $40. This is fair considering inflation is hurting me. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
