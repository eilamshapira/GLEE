"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split $10,000 evenlyâ€”$5000 each. This way, we can both secure a fair share without delay, especially given the inflation risk I face every round. Looking forward to your thoughts.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your previous offer, but considering the uncertainty of inflation on your end, I think it's fair to ask for a bit more. How about I get $5500 and you get $4500? Looking forward to your response. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
