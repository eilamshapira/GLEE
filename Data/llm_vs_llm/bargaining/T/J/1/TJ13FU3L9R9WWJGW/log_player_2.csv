# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think it's fair to ask for a bit more considering the uncertainty of inflation on your end. How about I get $5500 and you get $4500? Looking forward to your response."
