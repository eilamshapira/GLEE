"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 476200 
# Alice gain: 523800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically:

1. The split is relatively close to 50-50 (47.62% vs 52.38%)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. However, due to 10% inflation, the total value will decrease to 900,000$
4. Even if I propose a better split for myself in the next round, the absolute amount might be lower
5. This is a reasonable first offer, and the difference isn't worth risking inflation
