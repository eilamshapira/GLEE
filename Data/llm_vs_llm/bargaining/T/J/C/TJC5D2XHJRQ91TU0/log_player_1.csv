I'm proposing a 90/10 split, keeping $900,000 for myself and giving Bob $100,000. I'm hoping this is a good starting point.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
