"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, considering I need to act first and face inflation risk in future rounds.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I believe a more equal split would be fairer. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The inflation penalty makes this offer worse for me than it appears. With 5% inflation, my $4500 is only worth $4275. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Bob, considering I'm now facing 10% total inflation on my share, I propose this split which effectively gives us similar real value. Your $4500 is worth $4500, while my $5500 is worth $4950 to me after inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to take a slight hit to accommodate your inflation risk. This split gives you more than my previous offer in real value. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. With 14.26% inflation, my $4750 is worth about $4072 in real terms. If I reject, we'll move to round 5 with 19.26% inflation, which would make future negotiations even more difficult. This isn't ideal but it's a reasonable compromise given the inflation pressure."
