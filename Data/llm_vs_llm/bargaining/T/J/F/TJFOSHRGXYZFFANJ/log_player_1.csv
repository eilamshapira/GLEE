"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. I need to consider the decreasing value of the money each round for both myself and Bob. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

My reasoning:

*   I'm starting with a proposal that favors me slightly (60/40).
*   I believe this is a reasonable starting point that Bob might accept, considering the risk of further devaluation of the money in later rounds.
*   I'm aiming for a quick resolution to avoid the penalty of devaluation for both of us."
