"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer is giving me $400,000 while she keeps $600,000. While this isn't an even split, it's still a substantial amount of money.

Let me think about this... If I reject, I'll get to make a counter-offer in the next round. However, there's no guarantee Alice will accept a more favorable offer from me. Since $400,000 is a significant sum (40% of the total), and there's always risk in negotiation, I'll accept this offer.
