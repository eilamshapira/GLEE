"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me 4000$ out of 10000$
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 10% inflation, if I wait until next round:
   * The 4000$ offered now would be worth only 3600$ next round
   * Any amount I get next round will be worth 10% less to me

While I could try to negotiate for more, the inflation penalty makes waiting risky. 4000$ now is better than potentially getting a larger nominal amount that's worth less due to inflation.
