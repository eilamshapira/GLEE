"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43} 
```

Rationale:

* **Time pressure:**  The value of the money is decreasing for me each round. While I don't know how inflation affects Bob, I need to act quickly.
* **Concession:** I've lowered my demand slightly from Round 1 (60/40 to 57/43) to show a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Attractive to Bob:** This offer is still better than what Bob proposed in Round 2 (55/45).

I'm hoping Bob recognizes the time pressure and accepts this reasonable offer."
