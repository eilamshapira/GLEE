"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to factor in the inflation for myself.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the inflation impact. My gain from round 1 is now effectively worth 90% of its original value. Bob's gain is worth 80% of its original value.

Bob is offering me $45. I need to compare this to what I offered him, adjusted for inflation. My original offer to myself was $60, which is now worth $60 * 0.9 = $54.

$45 is less than $54. I will reject the offer.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I need to consider the cumulative inflation for myself. It's round 3, so my money is now worth 81% (0.9 * 0.9) of its original value. I also need to consider that we are getting closer to the deadline. I will adjust my offer to be more appealing to Bob, but still prioritize my gains accounting for inflation.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze. My money is now worth 72.9% of its original value (100% - 27.1%). Bob's money is worth 51.2% of its original value (100% - 48.8%).

Bob is offering me $49. My initial offer was $60, which would now be worth $60 * 0.729 = $43.74. My offer in round 3 was $55, worth $55 * 0.729 = $40.095.

$49 is greater than either of those adjusted values. Since the rounds are ticking down, and this is a better offer than I would have received from my previous offers, I will accept.
