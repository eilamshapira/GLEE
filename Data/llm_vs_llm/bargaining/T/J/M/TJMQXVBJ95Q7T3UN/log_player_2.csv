"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Alice's offer, I'll get 45, but its value is reduced by 36% due to inflation. So, the actual value I'll get is approximately 45 * 0.64 = 28.8.

Given this, I think I can try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, the total value of the money is decreasing. Since I don't know the exact inflation rate for Alice, I'll try to make a reasonable offer.

The money I gain is worth 36% less than in the first round, and now it's worth 20% less again, so it's 0.64 * 0.8 = 0.512 of the original value.

I'll try to get a bit more than half of the original value, considering the inflation.
