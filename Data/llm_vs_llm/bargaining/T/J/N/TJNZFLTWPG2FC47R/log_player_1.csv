Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see your inflation rate is much higher than mine (36% vs 9.75%). Given this significant difference, I'm proposing a 53-47 split in my favor. This actually benefits you more than continuing to negotiate, as your money is devaluing at nearly 4x the rate of mine. Let's settle now to maximize our combined value.
