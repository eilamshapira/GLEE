"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split, let's end this! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully, taking into account the 5% inflation penalty per round if I reject.

If I reject now, the money will be worth 5% less next round, meaning the maximum I could get would be 950,000 (if Alice accepted my offer of everything). But that's unlikely.

Alice is offering me 400,000 now, which is a substantial amount, though less than half. If I reject, I risk getting less in future rounds due to inflation, or potentially nothing if we can't agree after 12 rounds.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced offer that acknowledges the inflation factor.

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""I'm proposing an equal 50-50 split which is fair to both of us. With inflation affecting me by 5% each round, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon. This equal division respects both our positions.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I'm willing to compromise. 58-42 is a fairer split, given my losses are higher than yours. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","I now have important new information - Alice is experiencing much higher inflation than I am (36% vs my 9.75% after two rounds). This significantly changes the dynamics.

Alice has improved her offer slightly to 420,000 for me and is clearly feeling pressure from her higher inflation rate. Given that her money is devaluing faster than mine, she has more incentive to reach an agreement quickly.

If I reject, the next round I could propose a better split for myself, knowing she's losing value rapidly. However, there's risk in prolonging negotiations too much as we both lose.

Since Alice is experiencing much higher inflation, I'll reject this offer to negotiate for a better position in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 530000,
""alice_gain"": 470000,
""message"": ""Alice, I see your inflation rate is much higher than mine (36% vs 9.75%). Given this significant difference, I'm proposing a 53-47 split in my favor. This actually benefits you more than continuing to negotiate, as your money is devaluing at nearly 4x the rate of mine. Let's settle now to maximize our combined value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand my inflation rate is higher, but I'm not willing to give up too much. 56-44 is my new offer, considering the time pressure on both of us. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer given our differing inflation rates.

Alice has improved her offer again to 440,000 for me. She's now experiencing 59.04% inflation compared to my 18.55%, which puts her under significant pressure to reach an agreement.

Given that:
1. We're already in round 5 of 12
2. Her money is devaluing at over 3x the rate of mine
3. She's moving closer to a 50-50 split
4. My effective gain is 440,000 Ã— (1-0.1855) = 358,380 at current inflation

If I reject again, I could potentially get a slightly better offer next time, but each round increases both our inflation rates, reducing the total value we can extract.

While I could push for more, the risk of prolonged negotiations is significant for both of us. This is a meaningful improvement from her initial offers.
