"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:
1. The offer is $40 for me and $60 for Alice
2. If I reject, we go to next round where I can make an offer
3. However, due to 5% inflation, my $40 would become worth $38 next round
4. Any further delays will reduce my value even more
5. While not a completely fair split, $40 is a substantial amount

Given the inflation penalty I face and that this is a decent initial offer, I'll accept.
