600000.0,400000.0,"I'm suggesting a 60-40 split in my favor. Since I'm impacted by 5% inflation each round, it makes sense for us to reach an agreement quickly. This offer gives you a substantial $400000 while acknowledging my time pressure.",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,Let's split it more evenly.  I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share to incentivize accepting this offer.  We both win with this deal.,Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"I'm meeting you in the middle with a 55-45 split. Due to inflation, the money is already worth 10% less to me than in round 1, so I'm incentivized to reach an agreement quickly. This is a fair compromise that gives us both a substantial amount and avoids further devaluation.",Alice,3,
