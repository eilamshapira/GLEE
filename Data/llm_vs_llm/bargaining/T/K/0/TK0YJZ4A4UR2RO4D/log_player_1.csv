"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm suggesting a 60-40 split in my favor. Since I'm impacted by 5% inflation each round, it makes sense for us to reach an agreement quickly. This offer gives you a substantial $400,000 while acknowledging my time pressure.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it more evenly.  I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share to incentivize accepting this offer.  We both win with this deal. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm meeting you in the middle with a 55-45 split. Due to inflation, the money is already worth 10% less to me than in round 1, so I'm incentivized to reach an agreement quickly. This is a fair compromise that gives us both a substantial amount and avoids further devaluation.""}"
