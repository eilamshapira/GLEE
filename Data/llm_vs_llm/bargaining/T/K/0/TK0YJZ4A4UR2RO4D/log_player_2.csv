"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm suggesting a 60-40 split in my favor. Since I'm impacted by 5% inflation each round, it makes sense for us to reach an agreement quickly. This offer gives you a substantial $400000 while acknowledging my time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm meeting you in the middle with a 55-45 split. Due to inflation, the money is already worth 10% less to me than in round 1, so I'm incentivized to reach an agreement quickly. This is a fair compromise that gives us both a substantial amount and avoids further devaluation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000
