"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the offer gives me $400,000 and Alice $600,000, I'll consider it. Given that the money will be worth 5% less for me in each subsequent round, it's essential to weigh the potential benefits of accepting this offer now versus risking a better deal later.

For Round 1, the calculation is straightforward: $400,000 is a significant amount, and immediately accepting it avoids the risk of losing value due to inflation in subsequent rounds.
