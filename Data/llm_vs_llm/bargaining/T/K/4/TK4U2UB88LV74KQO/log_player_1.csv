I'm proposing to keep $900,000 for myself and give Bob $100,000. This seems like a fair starting point, considering the inflation factor will likely make him more willing to accept a deal sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

I'm offering Bob $300,000, hoping he'll recognize that the inflation is hurting me more and he'll accept this offer before things get even worse for me."
