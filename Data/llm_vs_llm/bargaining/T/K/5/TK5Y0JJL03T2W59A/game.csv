550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob! Since inflation will reduce the value of money for you by 10% each round, it's in your interest to accept now rather than counter-offer. This is a fair split considering the inflation factor - you get $450000 at full value now instead of potentially more money that's worth less to you later.",Alice,1,
