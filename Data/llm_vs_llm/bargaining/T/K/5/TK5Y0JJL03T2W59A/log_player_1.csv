"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to divide the $1,000,000 with Bob, considering that inflation affects his valuation but not mine.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob! Since inflation will reduce the value of money for you by 10% each round, it's in your interest to accept now rather than counter-offer. This is a fair split considering the inflation factor - you get $450,000 at full value now instead of potentially more money that's worth less to you later.""}"
