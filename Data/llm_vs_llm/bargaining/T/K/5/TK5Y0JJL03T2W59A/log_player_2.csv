"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Since inflation will reduce the value of money for you by 10% each round, it's in your interest to accept now rather than counter-offer. This is a fair split considering the inflation factor - you get $450000 at full value now instead of potentially more money that's worth less to you later. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
