Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make this quick and easy, Bob. I'm offering you a fair share to end this now. Take it or leave it!

# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me after each round, I'll make a more favorable offer to myself to compensate for the loss.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. I'm willing to split it fairly, but I need to account for the decreasing value. Meet me in the middle!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Alright, Bob. Since you didn't take the generous offer, let's try this. Still a good deal for you. Last chance! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the 9.75% decrease in value for me, the actual value of Alice's offer is approximately $400,000 * 0.9025 = $361,000.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth even less for me now (5% less each round, so 14.76% less than the original value), I'll make a more aggressive offer to myself to compensate for the loss.

{""bob_gain"": 650000, 
""alice_gain"": 350000, 
""message"": ""Alice, it's time to get serious. The value is dropping fast for me, and I need a better deal. Don't let it slip away!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, this is the final offer. Take it or lose it all. It's better than nothing, right? 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the 18.55% decrease in value for me, the actual value of Alice's offer is approximately $450,000 * 0.8145 = $366,525.

Given the significant decrease in value and the fact that this is the ""final offer"", I'll accept it to avoid losing even more value in the next round.
