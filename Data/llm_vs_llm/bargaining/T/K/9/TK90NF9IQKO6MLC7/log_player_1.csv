Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{

  ""bob_gain"": 487180,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that we settle now to avoid further devaluation. Given that each round costs us 5% of the total, a fair equilibrium split in this alternating offers game gives the proposer about 51.3% and the responder 48.7% of the total. I would get $512,820 and you would get $487,180. Accepting now spares us both additional losses. Let me know what you think!""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the 5% devaluation per round, accepting my offer now will give you more value than if we continue. I believe this split is reasonable, given the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 515500,
  ""bob_gain"": 484500,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, it's round 3 and waiting longer only worsens our outcomes due to inflation. To be fair and to give you at least what you'd get if you waited for round 4, I'm offering you $484,500 and keeping $515,500 for myself. In effect, with the 10% devaluation in this round, you receive approximately $436,050 in present value—marginally more than the $435,897 you'd expect if you waited. I believe this is a reasonable proposal that spares us both further losses. Let's settle now before the pie shrinks even more.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, we've both lost value due to inflation. Considering the current situation, I believe this split is fair, as it takes into account the losses we've both incurred. Accepting now will prevent further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 420400,
  ""bob_gain"": 579600,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, it's round 5. As we know, every round we wait deepens the loss from inflation. If you reject this offer, you'll propose in round 6 when the pie is worth only about 77.38% of its original value, and based on our past pattern, you could secure roughly $610,000 nominal for yourself—translating to a present value of about $472,000. To make accepting attractive, I'm offering you $579,600 nominal in round 5, which at the current discount factor (approximately 81.45%) gives you nearly the same present value (~$472,000), while sparing us further devaluation. I believe this deal is mutually optimal. Let’s settle now to minimize our losses.""
