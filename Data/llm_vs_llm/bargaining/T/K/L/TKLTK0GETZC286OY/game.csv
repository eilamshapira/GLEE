200000.0,800000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $200000 and you receive $800000. If you wait until the next round, the inflation hit will reduce the value of the money for you by 20%, whereas my loss is only 5% per round. In other words, by accepting this offer you secure an effective $800000 now, which is as good as the nearly full pie you could secure as proposer next round but discounted. Let’s settle now so we don’t both lose value.",Alice,1,
