"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 200000, ""bob_gain"": 800000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $200,000 and you receive $800,000. If you wait until the next round, the inflation hit will reduce the value of the money for you by 20%, whereas my loss is only 5% per round. In other words, by accepting this offer you secure an effective $800,000 now, which is as good as the nearly full pie you could secure as proposer next round but discounted. Let’s settle now so we don’t both lose value.""}"
