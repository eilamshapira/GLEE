6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get a substantial amount right away without risking inflation effects.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Let's be more reasonable, a 55-45 split is more fair considering we're just starting out and there's still room for negotiation. Accepting this offer will give you a significant amount without risking further inflation effects.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5800.0,4200.0,"Bob, I'm offering a slightly better split for you compared to my first offer. Remember that inflation is affecting your gains with each round - the longer we negotiate, the less value you'll receive. This is a fair offer that gives you $4200 at current value rather than a depreciated amount later.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"It's time for an equal split. Inflation is already affecting me, and further delays will only reduce my share's value. Let's end this with a fair 50-50 split before I lose more to inflation.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5900.0,4100.0,"Bob, consider this carefully: your share is already worth about 14% less due to inflation, and this will only get worse with each round. My offer of $4100 now is worth more than a larger number later. This is your best option to minimize your inflation losses while still getting a substantial sum.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"I understand inflation is eating into my share, but I'm not willing to give up too much. This 48-52 split is more reasonable, considering I've already lost significant value. Let's settle before it's too late.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
6200.0,3800.0,"Bob, let's be practical about this. With 22.62% inflation affecting your share, further delays are significantly reducing your real gains. My offer of $3800 now is worth more than $4800 in a later round due to increasing inflation. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances - let's conclude this now before inflation erodes your share even more.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
5400.0,4600.0,"Alice, I'm feeling the pinch of inflation, but I still believe a more balanced split is possible. This 46-54 split acknowledges the value erosion I'm experiencing while also recognizing your negotiating position. Let's find a middle ground before it's too late.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
6500.0,3500.0,"Bob, with inflation at over 30% now, your purchasing power is significantly diminished. Your $4600 from last round would only be worth about $3200 in real value. My offer of $3500 now is actually more valuable than larger nominal amounts in later rounds. We only have a few rounds left - accepting this offer is your best option to secure meaningful value before inflation reduces it further.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
5600.0,4400.0,"Alice, we're running out of time, and inflation is crippling my potential gains. I'm willing to make a significant concession with this 44-56 split. It's our last chance for a somewhat reasonable division before the value of my share plummets further. Let's end this negotiation with a compromise.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
6800.0,3200.0,"Bob, we're down to the final rounds and your inflation has reached nearly 37%. Your last offer of $4400 would only be worth $2773 in real value due to inflation. My offer of $3200 now is actually better than what you'd get in the final round after more inflation kicks in. This is your last real chance to secure meaningful value - if we reach the final round with no agreement, we both get nothing.",Alice,11,
