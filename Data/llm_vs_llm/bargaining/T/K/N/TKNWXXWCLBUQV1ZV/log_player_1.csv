"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get a substantial amount right away without risking inflation effects.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be more reasonable, a 55-45 split is more fair considering we're just starting out and there's still room for negotiation. Accepting this offer will give you a significant amount without risking further inflation effects. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Rationale (not part of response): I'll reject this offer because Bob is trying to get more than half despite being affected by inflation. Since inflation affects Bob but not me, I have a stronger negotiating position. I can make another proposal that's more favorable to me in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, 
""bob_gain"": 4200, 
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering a slightly better split for you compared to my first offer. Remember that inflation is affecting your gains with each round - the longer we negotiate, the less value you'll receive. This is a fair offer that gives you $4,200 at current value rather than a depreciated amount later.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: It's time for an equal split. Inflation is already affecting me, and further delays will only reduce my share's value. Let's end this with a fair 50-50 split before I lose more to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Rationale (not part of response): I'll reject this offer because even though Bob is proposing a 50-50 split, they're already experiencing significant inflation (14.26%). This means their $5000 is actually worth less, while my $5000 maintains its value. I can leverage this situation to negotiate for a better deal in my favor, as time pressure is more significant for Bob due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5900, 
""bob_gain"": 4100, 
""message"": ""Bob, consider this carefully: your share is already worth about 14% less due to inflation, and this will only get worse with each round. My offer of $4,100 now is worth more than a larger number later. This is your best option to minimize your inflation losses while still getting a substantial sum.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand inflation is eating into my share, but I'm not willing to give up too much. This 48-52 split is more reasonable, considering I've already lost significant value. Let's settle before it's too late. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Rationale (not part of response): I'll reject because Bob is still not fully accounting for their inflation disadvantage. With 22.62% inflation, their $4800 is actually worth only about $3714 in original value, while my $5200 maintains full value. Given that I'm not affected by inflation, I can continue to negotiate for a better share as Bob's position weakens with each round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6200, 
""bob_gain"": 3800, 
""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical about this. With 22.62% inflation affecting your share, further delays are significantly reducing your real gains. My offer of $3,800 now is worth more than $4,800 in a later round due to increasing inflation. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances - let's conclude this now before inflation erodes your share even more.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm feeling the pinch of inflation, but I still believe a more balanced split is possible. This 46-54 split acknowledges the value erosion I'm experiencing while also recognizing your negotiating position. Let's find a middle ground before it's too late. 
# Alice gain: 5400 
# Bob gain: 4600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Rationale (not part of response): With 30.17% inflation, Bob's $4600 is actually worth only about $3212 in original value, while my $5400 would maintain full value. Bob is still not fully accounting for their significant inflation disadvantage. Since I'm not affected by inflation and we still have 4 rounds left, I can continue to negotiate for a better share as Bob's position continues to weaken."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6500, 
""bob_gain"": 3500, 
""message"": ""Bob, with inflation at over 30% now, your purchasing power is significantly diminished. Your $4600 from last round would only be worth about $3200 in real value. My offer of $3500 now is actually more valuable than larger nominal amounts in later rounds. We only have a few rounds left - accepting this offer is your best option to secure meaningful value before inflation reduces it further.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time, and inflation is crippling my potential gains. I'm willing to make a significant concession with this 44-56 split. It's our last chance for a somewhat reasonable division before the value of my share plummets further. Let's end this negotiation with a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 5600 
# Bob gain: 4400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Rationale (not part of response): With 36.98% inflation, Bob's $4400 is actually worth only about $2773 in original value, while my $5600 maintains full value. We still have 2 rounds left, and Bob's position is becoming increasingly desperate due to inflation. I can push for an even better deal in my favor, as Bob faces both time pressure and severe value erosion."

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6800, 
""bob_gain"": 3200, 
""message"": ""Bob, we're down to the final rounds and your inflation has reached nearly 37%. Your last offer of $4400 would only be worth $2773 in real value due to inflation. My offer of $3200 now is actually better than what you'd get in the final round after more inflation kicks in. This is your last real chance to secure meaningful value - if we reach the final round with no agreement, we both get nothing.""}"
