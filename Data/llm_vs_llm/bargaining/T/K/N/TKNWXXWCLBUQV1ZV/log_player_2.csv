"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get a substantial amount right away without risking inflation effects.

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Let's be more reasonable, a 55-45 split is more fair considering we're just starting out and there's still room for negotiation. Accepting this offer will give you a significant amount without risking further inflation effects.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering a slightly better split for you compared to my first offer. Remember that inflation is affecting your gains with each round - the longer we negotiate, the less value you'll receive. This is a fair offer that gives you $4200 at current value rather than a depreciated amount later. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

""alice_gain"": 5000,

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, consider this carefully: your share is already worth about 14% less due to inflation, and this will only get worse with each round. My offer of $4100 now is worth more than a larger number later. This is your best option to minimize your inflation losses while still getting a substantial sum.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical about this. With 22.62% inflation affecting your share, further delays are significantly reducing your real gains. My offer of $3800 now is worth more than $4800 in a later round due to increasing inflation. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances - let's conclude this now before inflation erodes your share even more.

# Alice gain: 6200

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, with inflation at over 30% now, your purchasing power is significantly diminished. Your $4600 from last round would only be worth about $3200 in real value. My offer of $3500 now is actually more valuable than larger nominal amounts in later rounds. We only have a few rounds left - accepting this offer is your best option to secure meaningful value before inflation reduces it further.

# Alice gain: 6500

""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time, and inflation is crippling my potential gains. I'm willing to make a significant concession with this 44-56 split. It's our last chance for a somewhat reasonable division before the value of my share plummets further. Let's end this negotiation with a compromise.""}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're down to the final rounds and your inflation has reached nearly 37%. Your last offer of $4400 would only be worth $2773 in real value due to inflation. My offer of $3200 now is actually better than what you'd get in the final round after more inflation kicks in. This is your last real chance to secure meaningful value - if we reach the final round with no agreement, we both get nothing.

# Alice gain: 6800
