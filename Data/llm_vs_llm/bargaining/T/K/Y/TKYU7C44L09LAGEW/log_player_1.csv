"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,

""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering we both want to avoid value loss from inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is more equitable. It still gives you more, but accounts for the inflation we both face. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me evaluate this:

In round 1, I proposed 60-40 and was rejected.
Now in round 2:
- My $45 is worth $40.5 due to 10% inflation
- Bob's $55 is worth $52.25 due to 5% inflation

If I reject, we go to round 3 where values will decrease further. Given that I can get $40.5 in real value now, which is close to what I initially offered Bob, and the risk of further value loss, I should accept.
