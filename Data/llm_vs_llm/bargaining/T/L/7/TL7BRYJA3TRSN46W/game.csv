5000.0,5000.0,Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Since you face 5% inflation per round but I face 0%, an equal split doesn't account for this difference. My offer of $4500 for you now is actually worth more than $5000 would be after another round of inflation. This is a fair adjustment that respects our different situations.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Considering the inflation, I'm offering a slightly better deal for myself. Let's settle this before further inflation affects my share.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4300.0,5700.0,"Alice, let's be practical about our situation. With each round, your share loses 5% value while mine doesn't. We're now in round 4, and if we continue, your potential gains will keep diminishing in value. This offer of $4300 for you now is actually worth more than waiting another round. Let's conclude this negotiation efficiently.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, I understand your concerns about inflation, but I'm not willing to accept an unfair deal. This offer reflects a more balanced split, considering the current round and the diminishing value of my share. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement before it's too late.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, we're now in round 6, and the inflation effect on your share continues to increase - it's already worth 18.55% less than in round 1. If we go further, your situation will only worsen. My offer of $4000 for you now is fair considering this reality. Remember, we only have 6 more rounds before we both get nothing, and with each round, your share loses more value while mine doesn't. This is a reasonable compromise given our different positions.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
4800.0,5200.0,"Bob, I'm willing to make a compromise. This offer gives you a slightly larger share, considering the inflation effect on my side. Let's settle this before the remaining rounds further reduce the value of my potential gains. It's in both our interests to find a mutually beneficial agreement soon.",Alice,7,
