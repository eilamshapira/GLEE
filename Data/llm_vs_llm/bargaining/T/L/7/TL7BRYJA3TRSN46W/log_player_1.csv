"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since you face 5% inflation per round but I face 0%, an equal split doesn't account for this difference. My offer of $4500 for you now is actually worth more than $5000 would be after another round of inflation. This is a fair adjustment that respects our different situations. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and Bob's argument, I'll evaluate the offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I need to calculate the actual value of Bob's offer. The $4500 offered to me is worth 5% less than its face value, so its actual value to me is $4500 * 0.95 = $4275.

Given this, I think I can do better in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer and we're moving to Round 3, I need to consider the inflation again. The money I gain is now worth 10% less than its face value (5% less in Round 2 and another 5% less in Round 3).

To make a competitive offer, I'll aim to give Bob a bit less than he offered me in Round 2, while also considering the inflation.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 5200, 
""bob_gain"": 4800, 
""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm offering a slightly better deal for myself. Let's settle this before further inflation affects my share.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be practical about our situation. With each round, your share loses 5% value while mine doesn't. We're now in round 4, and if we continue, your potential gains will keep diminishing in value. This offer of $4300 for you now is actually worth more than waiting another round. Let's conclude this negotiation efficiently. 
# Alice gain: 4300 
# Bob gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection from Bob, and now we're in Round 4.

Let's calculate the actual value of Bob's offer to me, considering the inflation. Since the money I gain is worth 15% less (5% in Round 1, 5% in Round 2, 5% in Round 3, but for the value it's 1 - (1 - 0.05)^3 = 14.26% less) than its face value, the $4300 offered to me is worth $4300 * (1 - 0.1426) = $4300 * 0.8574 = $3686.22.

Given this, I think Bob's offer is not favorable to me, and I believe I can still negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since we're moving to Round 5, I need to consider the inflation again. The money I gain is now worth 19.08% less than its face value (5% less in Round 1, 5% less in Round 2, 5% less in Round 3, 5% less in Round 4, and the cumulative effect is 1 - (1 - 0.05)^4 = 19.08% less).

To make a competitive offer, I'll aim to give Bob a bit less than he offered me in Round 4, while also considering the inflation. I'll try to find a balance between being reasonable and protecting my share from further devaluation.

Here's my offer for Round 5:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your concerns about inflation, but I'm not willing to accept an unfair deal. This offer reflects a more balanced split, considering the current round and the diminishing value of my share. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement before it's too late.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're now in round 6, and the inflation effect on your share continues to increase - it's already worth 18.55% less than in round 1. If we go further, your situation will only worsen. My offer of $4000 for you now is fair considering this reality. Remember, we only have 6 more rounds before we both get nothing, and with each round, your share loses more value while mine doesn't. This is a reasonable compromise given our different positions. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection from Bob, and now we're in Round 6.

Let's calculate the actual value of Bob's offer to me, considering the inflation. Since the money I gain is worth 22.62% less (the cumulative effect of 5% less in each round, 1 - (1 - 0.05)^5 = 22.62% less) than its face value, the $4000 offered to me is worth $4000 * (1 - 0.2262) = $4000 * 0.7738 = $3095.20.

Given this, I think Bob's offer is still not favorable to me. Although he's right that the inflation effect on my share is increasing, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. However, I need to be cautious and consider the limited number of rounds left.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since we're moving to Round 7, I need to consider the inflation again. The money I gain is now worth 25.99% less than its face value (the cumulative effect of 5% less in each round, 1 - (1 - 0.05)^6 = 25.99% less).

To make a competitive offer, I'll aim to find a balance between being reasonable and protecting my share from further devaluation. I'll try to make a more generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept it and we can conclude the negotiation.

Here's my offer for Round 7:

{""alice_gain"": 4800, 
""bob_gain"": 5200, 
""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to make a compromise. This offer gives you a slightly larger share, considering the inflation effect on my side. Let's settle this before the remaining rounds further reduce the value of my potential gains. It's in both our interests to find a mutually beneficial agreement soon.""}"
