"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. 

Alice is proposing an equal split of $5,000 each. While this appears fair on the surface, I should consider our different inflation rates. For me, the money doesn't lose value with each round (0% inflation), but for Alice, it loses 5% per round.

This means I have a strategic advantage by rejecting and making a counter-offer in the next round, as Alice's potential share would be worth less to her. If I propose in the next round, I could reasonably ask for more than 50%.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a strategic offer that takes into account our different inflation rates while still being reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Since you face 5% inflation per round but I face 0%, an equal split doesn't account for this difference. My offer of $4,500 for you now is actually worth more than $5,000 would be after another round of inflation. This is a fair adjustment that respects our different situations.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm offering a slightly better deal for myself. Let's settle this before further inflation affects my share. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to analyze this offer carefully.

Alice is now proposing that I get $4,800 while she gets $5,200. This is less favorable to me than her original 50-50 split offer.

Since I face 0% inflation, waiting more rounds doesn't hurt me at all. For Alice, however, each round reduces the value of her share by 5%. After 2 rounds, she's already facing 9.75% inflation.

If I reject and we go to round 4, I can make another offer that accounts for her increasing inflation pressure. This gives me leverage to potentially get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5700, 
""alice_gain"": 4300,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be practical about our situation. With each round, your share loses 5% value while mine doesn't. We're now in round 4, and if we continue, your potential gains will keep diminishing in value. This offer of $4,300 for you now is actually worth more than waiting another round. Let's conclude this negotiation efficiently.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about inflation, but I'm not willing to accept an unfair deal. This offer reflects a more balanced split, considering the current round and the diminishing value of my share. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer strategically.

Alice is now offering me $4,500 while taking $5,500. This is actually worse for me than her previous offer in round 3 ($4,800), and significantly worse than her initial even split offer.

The key factor here is that inflation only affects Alice's share, not mine. She's now facing 18.55% inflation, meaning her $5,500 is worth less than it would have been in earlier rounds.

Since I don't face any inflation penalty, I maintain my negotiating leverage as rounds continue. If I reject this offer, I can make a counter-offer in round 6 that continues to account for her increasing inflation pressure.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, 
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're now in round 6, and the inflation effect on your share continues to increase - it's already worth 18.55% less than in round 1. If we go further, your situation will only worsen. My offer of $4,000 for you now is fair considering this reality. Remember, we only have 6 more rounds before we both get nothing, and with each round, your share loses more value while mine doesn't. This is a reasonable compromise given our different positions.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to make a compromise. This offer gives you a slightly larger share, considering the inflation effect on my side. Let's settle this before the remaining rounds further reduce the value of my potential gains. It's in both our interests to find a mutually beneficial agreement soon. 
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a significant change in Alice's position. She's now offering me $5,200 while taking $4,800, which means I'd get the majority share. This is better than all of her previous offers.

Let me evaluate this carefully:
- We're in round 7, with 5 rounds remaining
- Alice is now facing 26.49% inflation on her share
- For the first time, she's offering me the larger portion
- If I reject, I could potentially negotiate for even more in the next round
- However, there's also the risk of running out of rounds if we can't reach an agreement

Given that Alice has now moved to offering me the majority share, and considering we need to reach an agreement within the remaining rounds, this seems like a reasonable compromise.
