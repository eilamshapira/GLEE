"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to make a fair offer that takes into account the time discounting factor. Since Bob loses 10% of the value with each round while I don't lose any value, I have an advantage in negotiations. However, I should still be reasonable to avoid rejection.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I suggest this division because it acknowledges the asymmetry in our patience levels while still giving Bob a substantial portion. Since waiting would cost Bob 10% of the value in the next round, this offer should be attractive enough for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to consider our situation carefully. Bob rejected my 60-40 split, and I rejected his 40-60 split. With each round, Bob's value decreases by 10%, which affects his bargaining position. At this point, Bob faces a 20% total devaluation if we move to round 4.

{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}

I'm offering Bob $35, which is worth more to him now than waiting another round when his share would lose more value. This split acknowledges the time pressure Bob faces while still improving my position slightly from my initial offer."
