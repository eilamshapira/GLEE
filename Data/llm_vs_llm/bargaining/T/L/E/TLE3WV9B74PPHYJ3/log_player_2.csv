"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 90/10 split. Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is a very unfair offer. As a rational player, I can propose a more equitable split in the next round. A 90/10 split heavily favors Alice, and since we have many rounds remaining, I can make a counter-offer that would be more beneficial for both parties."

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split this equally - a 50/50 split benefits both of us. This is much more reasonable than a 90/10 split.""}"
