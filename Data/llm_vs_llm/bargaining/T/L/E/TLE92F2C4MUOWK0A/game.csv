55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a slightly favorable split for me since inflation will affect me more severely (20% vs 5%). This is fair considering the time value of money.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,Let's split the money 55/45 in my favor. This reflects the lower impact of inflation on me while still acknowledging the time value of money.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
65.0,35.0,"Bob, due to the 20% inflation penalty I face each round, I need a larger share to make this worthwhile. A $65/$35 split now would be roughly equivalent to a $52/$35 split in round 1 value for me, which is fair given our different inflation rates.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
55.0,45.0,"Alice, let's compromise. I understand your need for a larger share due to inflation, but a 45/55 split is the most I can offer. We both need to recognize the value of time and accept some compromise.",Bob,4,
