"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll propose a fair split while accounting for the fact that inflation impacts me more heavily than Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 55,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money 55/45 in my favor. This reflects the lower impact of inflation on me while still acknowledging the time value of money. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The inflation impact is too severe for me to accept this split. Since money is worth 20% less for me this round, getting $45 now is equivalent to only $36 in round 1 value. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Bob, due to the 20% inflation penalty I face each round, I need a larger share to make this worthwhile. A $65/$35 split now would be roughly equivalent to a $52/$35 split in round 1 value for me, which is fair given our different inflation rates.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's compromise. I understand your need for a larger share due to inflation, but a 45/55 split is the most I can offer. We both need to recognize the value of time and accept some compromise. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because with increasing rounds, inflation is severely eroding the value for both of us, but especially for me. While not ideal, $55 now (worth about $28.16 in round 1 value for me) is better than risking another round where inflation would cut the value even more drastically."
