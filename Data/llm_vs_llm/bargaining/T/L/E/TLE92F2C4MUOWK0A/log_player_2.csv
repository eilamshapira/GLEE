"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a slightly favorable split for me since inflation will affect me more severely (20% vs 5%). This is fair considering the time value of money. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

  ""bob_gain"": 55,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, due to the 20% inflation penalty I face each round, I need a larger share to make this worthwhile. A $65/$35 split now would be roughly equivalent to a $52/$35 split in round 1 value for me, which is fair given our different inflation rates. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65

  ""message"": ""Alice, let's compromise. I understand your need for a larger share due to inflation, but a 45/55 split is the most I can offer. We both need to recognize the value of time and accept some compromise.""
