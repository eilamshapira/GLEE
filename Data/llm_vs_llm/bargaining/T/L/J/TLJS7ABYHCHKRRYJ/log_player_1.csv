"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split the money 55/45. This gives me a slight advantage, but is still a very fair offer considering we only have a limited number of rounds. Let's avoid prolonged negotiations that diminish the value of the money, I believe this is a mutually beneficial split.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the diminishing value due to inflation, I'm making a generous offer to ensure we both benefit. This split acknowledges the time-sensitive nature of our negotiation and the need for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
