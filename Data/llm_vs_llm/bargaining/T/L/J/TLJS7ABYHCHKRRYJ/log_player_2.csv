"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the money 55/45. This gives me a slight advantage, but is still a very fair offer considering we only have a limited number of rounds. Let's avoid prolonged negotiations that diminish the value of the money, I believe this is a mutually beneficial split. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the effective amount I'm negotiating over is now $8,000 (80% of $10,000). However, to make the offer clear in terms of the original $10,000, I'll calculate my share based on this reduced value but express it in terms of the original amount.

To make a fair offer considering the inflation effect on me, I'll aim for a split that reflects a reasonable compromise, taking into account that I've already lost 20% of the potential value due to inflation.

My offer is to take 40% of the original $10,000, which is $4,000, and give Alice 60%, which is $6,000.
