"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer that takes into account the 5% inflation penalty I face each round.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose we split the money with me getting $550,000 and you getting $450,000. This is a fair division that gives me slightly more to account for the inflation disadvantage I face. If we delay agreement, the total value decreases for me, so I'm offering a reasonable split that benefits us both right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 525000, 
""bob_gain"": 475000}

I propose a more balanced split with me getting $525,000 and you getting $475,000. This accounts for the increasing inflation penalty I face - we're now at a 10% cumulative disadvantage for me. Let's reach an agreement soon to maximize our combined value. This offer gives you more than my initial proposal and is fair given the time pressure I face."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000
