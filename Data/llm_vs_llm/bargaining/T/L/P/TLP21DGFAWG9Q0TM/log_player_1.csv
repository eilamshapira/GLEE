"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split but slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer and Bob has the option to counter.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable split that gives both of us a substantial portion, while giving me a small advantage as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
- If I accept now, I'll get $45 but it's worth 20% less due to inflation, so effectively $36
- If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount I get will be worth another 20% less (total 40% less than original value)
- My original offer was already reasonable
- The difference between Bob's current offer and my previous one isn't huge
- Further negotiation will keep reducing the real value of my gain

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's offer since the inflation penalty makes further negotiation less attractive, and the split is still reasonably fair."
