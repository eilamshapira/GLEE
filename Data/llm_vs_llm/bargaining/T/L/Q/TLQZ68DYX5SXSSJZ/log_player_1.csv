"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to consider my initial offer carefully, keeping in mind that each round decreases the value by 10% for me, but not for Bob. This gives Bob some advantage in later rounds, so I should make a reasonable first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a reasonable first offer that gives me a good portion while still being fair enough that Bob might accept rather than moving to the next round."
