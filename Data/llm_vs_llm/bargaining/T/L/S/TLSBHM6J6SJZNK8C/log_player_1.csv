I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a generous offer considering I will receive the larger share. I believe this will be accepted as it is a fair and reasonable distribution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
