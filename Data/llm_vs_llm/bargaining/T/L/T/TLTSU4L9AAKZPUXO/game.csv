833000.0,167000.0,"Hi Bob! Since money loses 20% value for you each round while keeping full value for me, this offer is actually in your favor. If you reject and we go to round 2, your $1 is only worth $0.80, so this offer of $167000 now is worth more than even a larger amount next round. Let's make a deal now that acknowledges this timing advantage.",Alice,1,
