"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer that considers the inflation structure of the game.

""message"": ""Hi Bob! Since money loses 20% value for you each round while keeping full value for me, this offer is actually in your favor. If you reject and we go to round 2, your $1 is only worth $0.80, so this offer of $167,000 now is worth more than even a larger amount next round. Let's make a deal now that acknowledges this timing advantage.""}"
