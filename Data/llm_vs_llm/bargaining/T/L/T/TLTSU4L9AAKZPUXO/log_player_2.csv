"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Since money loses 20% value for you each round while keeping full value for me, this offer is actually in your favor. If you reject and we go to round 2, your $1 is only worth $0.80, so this offer of $167000 now is worth more than even a larger amount next round. Let's make a deal now that acknowledges this timing advantage. 
# Bob gain: 167000 
# Alice gain: 833000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
