"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since this is the first round, I'll make a reasonable offer to divide the $100. I'll propose a 50-50 split, which is a fair and common starting point for negotiations.

Here's my offer in JSON format:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly and end the game quickly!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I need a bit more to account for inflation. Let's settle this round! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I need to consider the actual value of the offer. 

In the first round, $45 would have been worth $45 to me. However, due to the 20% inflation, the $45 offered by Bob in this round is equivalent to $45 * 0.8 = $36 in the first round's value.

Considering this, I think I can try to negotiate a better deal, as $36 (the equivalent value of $45 after inflation) is less than my initial offer of $50.

My response:

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's now my turn to make a proposal again. Considering the inflation, the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, and another 20% less than in the second round, which means it's worth 40% less than the original value.

To calculate the equivalent value, I'll consider the two rounds of inflation: 
$1 in the first round = $1
$1 in the second round = $1 * 0.8 = $0.8
$1 in the third round = $0.8 * 0.8 = $0.64

So, the money I gain in this round is worth 64% of its original value.

I'll make an offer that takes into account the decreased value of the money for me. I'll propose a split where I get a bit more than Bob, to compensate for the inflation affecting me more.

Here's my offer in JSON format:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I need a bit more to make it fair. Let's settle this round!""
}
```"
