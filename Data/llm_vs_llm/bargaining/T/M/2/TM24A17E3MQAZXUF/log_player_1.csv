"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a division that accounts for the fact that money will be worth less for me in future rounds, so I need to secure a good deal now.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor because if we go to the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me, so I need to ensure I get a good portion now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer because even with the 20% inflation penalty, I can still try to get a better deal in the next round. A 30-70 split is too unfavorable, as even with the inflation penalty, I would only get $24 in effective value (30 * 0.8). I'll make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","At this point, the money is worth 40% less to me (due to two rounds of 20% inflation). I need to propose a deal that's good enough for both of us to accept, as further rounds will significantly decrease the value for me.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split. Given the 40% inflation penalty, this would give me an effective value of $33 (55 * 0.6), which is better than Bob's last offer. For Bob, $45 is still a reasonable amount, making this offer more likely to be accepted."
