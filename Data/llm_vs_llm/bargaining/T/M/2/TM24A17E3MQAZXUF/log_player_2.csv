"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice offers me $40, keeping $60 for herself. Since we're in Round 1, I can make a counter-offer in Round 2 if I reject. Due to the 20% inflation penalty that only affects Alice, her $60 would be worth less to her in the next round, while my portion maintains full value.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in Round 2, I could potentially get a better deal since Alice would be more incentivized to accept due to the inflation penalty she faces.

Therefore, I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice faces a 20% inflation penalty per round, I can propose a division that takes advantage of this. If she rejects my offer, any money she gets in the next round will be worth 20% less to her again.

I'll propose a more favorable split for myself, but not so extreme that she would definitely reject it.

{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30}

I propose this split because $30 now is worth more to Alice than potentially getting more in the next round when it will be devalued by another 20%. This should make it rational for her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is now offering me $45, which is better than her initial offer of $40
2. For Alice, her $55 share is actually only worth $35.20 (64% of $55) due to the cumulative inflation
3. If I reject, and we go to round 4:
   - I can make another offer
   - But Alice will face even more inflation (additional 20%)
   - However, Alice might reject again, prolonging the game

Since I'm being offered $45 (full value to me) and Alice is already taking a significant hit from inflation, this seems like a reasonable offer. If I reject, there's a risk of the negotiation breaking down or leading to a worse outcome through multiple more rounds.
