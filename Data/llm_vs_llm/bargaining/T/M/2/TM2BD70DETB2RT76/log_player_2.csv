"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer is better than Alice's previous one, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. The impact of inflation is becoming significant, but not enough to warrant accepting such a low amount. By rejecting, I signal that I'm willing to endure a few more rounds to secure a better deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000} 

**Reasoning:**

This offer is slightly better for Alice than if I had accepted in the previous round (considering inflation), but significantly better for me. It represents a reasonable compromise at this stage, acknowledging the diminishing value of the money over time."
