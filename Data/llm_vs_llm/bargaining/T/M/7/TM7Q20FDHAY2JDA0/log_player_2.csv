"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair split to start with. Let's end this quickly! 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice is offering me $2000 (20%) while keeping $8000 (80%)
2. If I reject, we go to next round where:
   - My $2000 would be worth $1800 (10% less)
   - Her $8000 would be worth $6400 (20% less)
3. This gives me negotiating power since she loses value faster
4. This first offer is quite unfair, and I can likely get a better deal even accounting for the value loss

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer, considering our different inflation rates:

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Since you lose value faster (20% vs my 10%), this is actually advantageous for both of us to agree now. You'd get $4500 now instead of $3600 next round.""}"
