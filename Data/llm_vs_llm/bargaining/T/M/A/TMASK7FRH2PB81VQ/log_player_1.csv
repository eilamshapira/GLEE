Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since you rejected a generous offer, I propose a less favorable split for you. Take it or leave it, the money is worth less to you each round. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer as it's too unfavorable. Even with the 5% inflation penalty, I can still try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I'm offering a more balanced split now. Due to 10% cumulative inflation for me, this is actually worth less than my first offer. Let's be reasonable and finish this game.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're running out of options. I'm increasing my share. This is the last offer you'll get from me. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept this offer because with continued inflation, my position will only get worse. Even though this is not an ideal split, getting $30 with 14.26% inflation (worth about $25.72 in original value) is better than risking further rounds where both the offered amount and its real value might decrease even more."
