"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. There's no inflation penalty for me, so waiting doesn't hurt my position
4. 40/60 split is somewhat unfavorable to me
5. I can probably negotiate a better deal

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a more balanced offer, but still slightly in my favor since I have the power to make the proposal now:

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I propose this split because:
1. It's closer to a fair 50/50 division
2. It gives me a slight advantage
3. It's reasonable enough that Alice might accept it rather than risk another round
4. Since there's no inflation penalty for me, I can afford to be somewhat aggressive in my proposal"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is offering me $45, which is better than her initial offer of $40
2. She's asking for $55, but for her this is worth 36% less than in round 1 due to inflation
3. My $45 is still worth full value since I'm not affected by inflation
4. If I reject, I can make another offer, but Alice's portion will be worth even less due to inflation
5. This seems like a reasonable offer given that Alice is already suffering from significant inflation
