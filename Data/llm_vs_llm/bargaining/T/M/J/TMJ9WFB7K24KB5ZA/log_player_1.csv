"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it equally. It's fair and considers the inflation risk for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same, but Bob's offer doesn't take into account the 5% less value for him, I think I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect on Bob's gain, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself. Since Bob's gain is worth 5% less, and it's now Round 3, I'll assume the inflation effect on Bob's gain has increased (although I don't know the exact rate).

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 650000,
  ""bob_gain"": 350000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation risk, I'm willing to give you a significant share, but I need a bit more to ensure my gain is worthwhile.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I need to secure more for myself. This offer ensures we both get a good share, but it's time to adjust for the risk I'm facing. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect on Bob's gain increasing to 14.26%, I think his offer is more reasonable. He's trying to secure more for himself to compensate for the loss in value. Considering I'm not affected by inflation, I'll evaluate the offer based on the nominal values.

Bob's offer gives me $450,000, which is still a significant amount. Since I don't know how the inflation rate will change in the next round, and I don't want to risk losing more value, I'll accept this offer.
