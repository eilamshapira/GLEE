"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","For my offer, I want to consider our different inflation rates. Since I face less inflation (10% per round) compared to Bob (20% per round), it might make sense for me to propose a split that acknowledges this difference.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose a slightly favorable split for me, but one that's still quite reasonable. Given our different inflation rates, this offer is fair, and accepting it now would be better for Bob than going through multiple rounds of negotiations with increasing inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer. This is actually a better deal for me than what I initially proposed. At this point, I get $6,000 which is only worth 10% less to me than in the first round, so it's still better than my initial offer of $5,500 at full value. It's a reasonable division that favors me, and accepting now avoids further depreciation of the money for both of us."
