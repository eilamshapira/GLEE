"Round 1

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""My turn, a bit more balanced, don't you think?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time. It's a fair deal, and we can both get a decent amount before things get worse. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $5000 I would gain is actually worth $5000 * 0.81 = $4050 in the original value. Since this is still a decent amount and splitting it evenly seems fair, I'll accept the offer.
