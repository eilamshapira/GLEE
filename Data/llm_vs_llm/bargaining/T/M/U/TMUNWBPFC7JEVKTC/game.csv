6000.0,4000.0,Let's split it fairly.  I'll take 60% and you get 40%.  It's a good start!,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
2000.0,8000.0,"Alice, consider the effect of delay on your share—the value you receive now is worth more than waiting and facing further devaluation. I propose 2000 nominal dollars for you (which is effectively 1600 for you in this round) and 8000 for me. I believe this division better reflects the realities of the devaluation and secures us both a prompt agreement. What do you say?",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Bob, I understand your point about inflation, but I still need a fair share. 4000 for me and 6000 for you is a good compromise. We can avoid further devaluation and reach an agreement quickly. Let's be reasonable.",Alice,3,

1.0,9999.0,"Alice, I understand your desire for a fair share, but the inflation is relentlessly eroding the value of the money you receive. Since each additional round reduces your share by about 20%, waiting any longer would leave you with almost nothing. In fact, if you reject this offer and get to propose in the next round, you'll find that I can command nearly the entire sum. For your sake, I’m offering you a small, but positive share now—something you wouldn’t get if we delayed further. Please accept this proposal so we can both avoid further devaluation.",Bob,4,

1000.0,9000.0,"Bob,  I'm surprised you think I'd accept that last offer. While inflation is a factor, I won't be bullied into accepting a pittance. I'm offering 1000 for myself and 9000 for you. This is a fair compromise given the circumstances. It's a better outcome than going another round and seeing my share shrink even further. Let's end this now and move on.",Alice,5,
,,"Alice, while your offer gives me 9000 dollars, I believe waiting one more round will allow us to avoid further losses on your side due to inflation. As you know, my share is not affected by the delay and I can secure an even more favorable division in the next round. Let's move to round 6.",Bob,5,reject
8000.0,2000.0,"Alice, in round 7 you’d be the proposer, but your money would be discounted further—to only 0.262144 of its nominal value. That means if you rejected this offer, even by taking nearly the whole $10000, its effective worth to you would be about $2621.44. Accepting my offer now guarantees you 8000 nominal dollars, which, at the current inflation rate (0.32768), is also worth roughly $2621.44 to you. Given that waiting won’t improve your effective share but only adds uncertainty, I urge you to accept this offer and avoid further devaluation.",Bob,6,
