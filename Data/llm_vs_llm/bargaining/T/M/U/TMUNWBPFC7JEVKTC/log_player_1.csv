Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, consider the effect of delay on your share—the value you receive now is worth more than waiting and facing further devaluation. I propose 2000 nominal dollars for you (which is effectively 1600 for you in this round) and 8000 for me. I believe this division better reflects the realities of the devaluation and secures us both a prompt agreement. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire for a fair share, but the inflation is relentlessly eroding the value of the money you receive. Since each additional round reduces your share by about 20%, waiting any longer would leave you with almost nothing. In fact, if you reject this offer and get to propose in the next round, you'll find that I can command nearly the entire sum. For your sake, I’m offering you a small, but positive share now—something you wouldn’t get if we delayed further. Please accept this proposal so we can both avoid further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 9999

I'm offering 1000 for myself and 9000 for you. This is a fair compromise given the circumstances. It's a better outcome than going another round and seeing my share shrink even further. Let's end this now and move on.""}

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, in round 7 you’d be the proposer, but your money would be discounted further—to only 0.262144 of its nominal value. That means if you rejected this offer, even by taking nearly the whole $10000, its effective worth to you would be about $2621.44. Accepting my offer now guarantees you 8000 nominal dollars, which, at the current inflation rate (0.32768), is also worth roughly $2621.44 to you. Given that waiting won’t improve your effective share but only adds uncertainty, I urge you to accept this offer and avoid further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000
