"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly.  I'll take 60% and you get 40%.  It's a good start!

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 8000, ""alice_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Alice, consider the effect of delay on your share—the value you receive now is worth more than waiting and facing further devaluation. I propose 2000 nominal dollars for you (which is effectively 1600 for you in this round) and 8000 for me. I believe this division better reflects the realities of the devaluation and secures us both a prompt agreement. What do you say?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point about inflation, but I still need a fair share. 4000 for me and 6000 for you is a good compromise. We can avoid further devaluation and reach an agreement quickly. Let's be reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 9999, ""alice_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your desire for a fair share, but the inflation is relentlessly eroding the value of the money you receive. Since each additional round reduces your share by about 20%, waiting any longer would leave you with almost nothing. In fact, if you reject this offer and get to propose in the next round, you'll find that I can command nearly the entire sum. For your sake, I’m offering you a small, but positive share now—something you wouldn’t get if we delayed further. Please accept this proposal so we can both avoid further devaluation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I'm surprised you think I'd accept that last offer. While inflation is a factor, I won't be bullied into accepting a pittance. I'm offering 1000 for myself and 9000 for you. This is a fair compromise given the circumstances. It's a better outcome than going another round and seeing my share shrink even further. Let's end this now and move on. 
# Bob gain: 9000 
# Alice gain: 1000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Alice, while your offer gives me 9000 dollars, I believe waiting one more round will allow us to avoid further losses on your side due to inflation. As you know, my share is not affected by the delay and I can secure an even more favorable division in the next round. Let's move to round 6.""}"

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 2000, ""alice_gain"": 8000, ""message"": ""Alice, in round 7 you’d be the proposer, but your money would be discounted further—to only 0.262144 of its nominal value. That means if you rejected this offer, even by taking nearly the whole $10,000, its effective worth to you would be about $2,621.44. Accepting my offer now guarantees you 8000 nominal dollars, which, at the current inflation rate (0.32768), is also worth roughly $2,621.44 to you. Given that waiting won’t improve your effective share but only adds uncertainty, I urge you to accept this offer and avoid further devaluation.""}"
