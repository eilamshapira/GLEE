"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, Bob. A little extra for me to start. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
- She's offering me $45 and taking $55
- It's close to a 50-50 split
- If I reject, the total amount will decrease by 5% to $95 in the next round
- I could propose a more favorable split next round, but Alice might reject
- The current offer is reasonable and guarantees me $45
