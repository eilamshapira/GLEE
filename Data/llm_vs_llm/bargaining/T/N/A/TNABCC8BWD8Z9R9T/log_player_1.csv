"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an initial offer to Bob, considering the different inflation rates affecting us.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

Given that inflation affects Bob more severely (20% per round) compared to my inflation rate (5% per round), I'm offering him a substantial portion now. This is a fair offer that acknowledges the time pressure on both of us, but especially on Bob."
