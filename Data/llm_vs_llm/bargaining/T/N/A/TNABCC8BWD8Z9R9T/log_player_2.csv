"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully given the inflation rates. 

If I reject now, we'll go to round 2 where I can make an offer. However, the money will be worth 20% less to me, meaning the $10,000 is effectively worth only $8,000 to me in the next round. For Alice, it would be worth $9,500 due to her 5% inflation rate.

Alice's current offer gives me $4,500, which is 45% of the total. If I wait a round, I'd need to get more than $5,625 ($4,500 รท 0.8) to make up for the inflation penalty I'll suffer.

Given the significant inflation difference between us (20% vs 5%), waiting puts me at a disadvantage, and Alice's offer of $4,500 is reasonable considering she has the first-mover advantage.
