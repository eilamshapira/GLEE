"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the $100 equally. This is fair for both of us and we can resolve this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's offer.

Alice is proposing a 50/50 split of the $100, which would give me $50 and her $50. This is a perfectly fair and equal division that reflects standard norms of fairness.

Given that we have a 12-round limit and both of us would get nothing if we can't agree, accepting a fair offer early is reasonable. There's no strategic advantage in rejecting this balanced proposal.
