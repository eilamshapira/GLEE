"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer to divide the $10,000 between Bob and myself.

Given that we're facing 5% inflation per round, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. A fair split would give us both equal amounts, but I'll offer slightly more to Bob to encourage him to accept immediately.

{""alice_gain"": 4800, ""bob_gain"": 5200}

I believe this is a fair offer that gives Bob a bit more than half, showing good faith and acknowledging that he has the power to accept or decline."
