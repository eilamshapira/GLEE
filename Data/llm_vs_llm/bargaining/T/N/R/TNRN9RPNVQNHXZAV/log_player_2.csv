"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer seems fair, with a 52%-48% split in my favor. Considering that the money is worth 5% less each round, if I reject and we go to another round, the total will be worth only $9,500. Even if I could get a higher percentage in the next round, the absolute dollar amount might end up being less. This is a reasonable first offer.
