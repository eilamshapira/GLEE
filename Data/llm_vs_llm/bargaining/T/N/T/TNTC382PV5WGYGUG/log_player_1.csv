"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""I suggest a fair 60-40 split, giving you a substantial $4,000 while acknowledging my role as the first mover.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation affecting my share, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This offer still gives you a significant portion while adjusting for the decreased value of money over time. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $4,500 with 5% inflation, so effectively $4,275
- If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount I get will be worth 10% less than the original value
- If I propose 6000 next round, it would be worth $5,400 to me, but we risk further rounds and more inflation
- Bob's current offer is reasonable given the inflation effects
