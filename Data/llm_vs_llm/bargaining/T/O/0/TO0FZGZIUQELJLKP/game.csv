45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, since the value of the money is decreasing, I propose a split where I get 55 and you get 45. Let's settle this quickly before it loses more value.",Bob,2,

52.0,48.0,"Bob, let's be reasonable. We've both tried for a slight advantage, but we're losing value every round. I'm moving closer to 50-50. Accept this fair offer and we'll both walk away with more money than if we continue negotiating.",Alice,3,

48.0,52.0,"Alice, I see you're moving towards a more even split, which is good. However, considering the inflation, I propose 52 for me and 48 for you. Let's end this soon to minimize our losses.",Bob,4,
