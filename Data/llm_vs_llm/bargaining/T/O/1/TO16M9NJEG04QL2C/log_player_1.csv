"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making a fair offer that also takes into account the different inflation rates we face.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

Since Bob's money devalues faster (20% per round) compared to mine (10% per round), it's in his interest to accept a reasonable offer now rather than waiting. This division gives him a substantial portion while acknowledging that I have a slight advantage in the negotiation due to the inflation rates."
