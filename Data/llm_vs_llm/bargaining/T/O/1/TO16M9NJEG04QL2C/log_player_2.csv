"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering me $4500 out of the $10,000, while she takes $5500. Let me consider this.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, we'd face inflation. The money would be worth 20% less to me and 10% less to Alice. This means the $10,000 would effectively be worth $8,000 to me and $9,000 to Alice.

If I make a counter-offer in the next round, I'd need to propose something that gives Alice at least what she'd get now after her inflation ($5,500 × 0.9 = $4,950) to make it acceptable to her. This leaves me with $10,000 - $4,950 = $5,050, but after my 20% inflation, that's only worth $5,050 × 0.8 = $4,040 to me.

Since $4,500 now is better than $4,040 in the next round, I should accept this offer.
