"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer gives me $4000 while taking $6000 for herself. I need to consider that if I reject this offer, we'll move to the next round where I can make a counter-offer, but the money will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation.

If I reject, the $10,000 will effectively be worth $9,000 to me in the next round. But I could potentially propose a more favorable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split, considering that inflation affects me. Since I'm making this offer after rejecting Alice's initial proposal, I should aim for a fair distribution while acknowledging the time pressure I face from inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering a split where I receive $5500 and Alice receives $4500. This is more favorable to me than Alice's initial offer, but still gives her a substantial portion. Since I'm facing inflation pressure, this seems like a reasonable compromise."
