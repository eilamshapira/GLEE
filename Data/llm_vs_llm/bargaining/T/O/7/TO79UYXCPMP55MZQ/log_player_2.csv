"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Take it or leave it, Bob. It's a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze the situation.

*   **Alice's offer:** Bob gets $100,000, Alice gets $900,000.

*   **Inflation:** This is round 1, so there is no inflation yet.

*   **Bob's perspective:** Getting $100,000 in the first round is a guaranteed amount. If I reject and make an offer in round 2, I risk Alice rejecting my offer, and the value of the money decreases for both of us.

Given the substantial amount Alice is keeping, rejecting might seem tempting to negotiate a larger share. However, considering the risk of further devaluation in later rounds, securing $100,000 now is a reasonable option.
