"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me 47.5% ($475,000) while taking 52.5% ($525,000)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, the total amount will decrease to $950,000
4. My potential maximum in the next round would be less than what I'm offered now
5. This is a fairly reasonable first offer, close to 50-50
