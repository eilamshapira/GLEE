"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","As Alice, I need to make an offer to divide $10,000 between Bob and myself in this first round. I should consider that with each passing round, the money loses 5% of its value for me, so there's an incentive to reach an agreement sooner rather than later.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose a 50-50 split of the money, which seems fair to both parties. This gives us each $5,000, and we can avoid the negative effects of inflation by settling now."
