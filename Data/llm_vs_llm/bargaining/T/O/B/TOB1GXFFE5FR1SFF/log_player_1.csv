"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,

""message"": ""I suggest a fair 60-40 split, considering we both want to conclude this quickly to avoid inflation losses.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it equally and both come out winning without any losses. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
* If I accept now, I'll get $50 but with 10% inflation, so effectively $45
* If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount I get will be worth 20% less
* Even if I could get $60 next round, it would only be worth $48 to me
* Plus Bob might reject again, leading to even more inflation losses

Given this analysis, I should accept this fair split now rather than risk further devaluation of my share.
