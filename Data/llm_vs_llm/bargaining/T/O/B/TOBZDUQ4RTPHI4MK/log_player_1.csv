"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair first offer, considering that time pressure affects me more than Bob due to the 20% inflation penalty per round.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose $5,500 for me and $4,500 for Bob. This is slightly in my favor but still quite fair, giving Bob a strong incentive to accept rather than move to the next round where my future gains would be reduced by 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
- If I accept, I get $4000, but due to 20% inflation, it's only worth $3200 to me
- If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 3, any amount I get will be worth 40% less due to inflation
- In round 3, even if I managed to get $6000, it would only be worth $3600 to me due to 40% inflation
- There's no guarantee Bob would accept a higher offer in round 3
- The risk of further rounds with increasing inflation makes this current offer more attractive
