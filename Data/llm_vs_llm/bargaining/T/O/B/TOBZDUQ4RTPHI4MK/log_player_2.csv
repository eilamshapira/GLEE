"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Since Alice's money loses 20% value each round, in the next round:
* My $5500 proposal would be worth only $4400 to her
* While any amount would still be worth 100% to me

I can likely get a better deal by rejecting and making a counter-offer, since Alice will be more incentivized to accept due to the 20% depreciation she faces.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice faces a 20% depreciation in value in each round, I should propose an offer that's favorable to me while still being attractive enough for her to accept rather than risk another round where her money would be worth even less.

If she rejects my offer and proposes in the next round, her money will be worth 40% less to her. This gives me significant leverage.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

I suggest this division because even though it's less than what she initially offered herself, $4000 now is worth more to her than potentially getting less value in future rounds due to the 20% depreciation she faces."
