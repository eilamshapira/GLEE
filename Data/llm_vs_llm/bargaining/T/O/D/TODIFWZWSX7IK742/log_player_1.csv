"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 51,
  ""bob_gain"": 49
}
```

My proposal is that I get $51 and Bob gets $49. I'm offering slightly more to myself, but hopefully, this is close enough to be accepted."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I will consider the inflation and Bob's offer. If I reject, the money will be worth even less next round. Bob is proposing $45 for me, which is less than my initial offer. However, considering the 10% inflation, the equivalent value of $51 from last round is now $45.9. Therefore, Bob's offer is worse than my original offer, considering inflation.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, taking into account the inflation, I need to offer Bob something that is worthwhile for him, but also ensures I get a reasonable amount. Since we've already had two rejections and the money is losing value, I'll make a concession but still prioritize my gain slightly.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```"
