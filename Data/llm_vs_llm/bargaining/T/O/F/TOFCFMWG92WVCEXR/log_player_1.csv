"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me propose a first offer that takes into account the 20% depreciation per round for my value.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor because I'm at a disadvantage due to the depreciation rate affecting only my gains. This is a fair first offer that gives both of us a substantial amount while accounting for my time pressure."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. With 20% depreciation, the $4000 offered to me is actually worth $3200 from my perspective. If I reject and we go to the next round, any amount I get will be worth another 20% less. While I could try to negotiate for more, the risk of further depreciation and potential deadlock is significant.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept this offer because while it's not ideal, the depreciation pressure means waiting for better offers could leave me worse off."
