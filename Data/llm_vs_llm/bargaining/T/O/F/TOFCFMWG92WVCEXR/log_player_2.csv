"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Since the money doesn't lose value for me over time, I have an advantage in negotiation. For Alice, each round reduces her money's value by 20%. If I reject now and propose in the next round, Alice might be more inclined to accept a better deal for me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice faces a 20% depreciation per round, I should propose a division that reflects this dynamic while still being reasonable enough for her to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering Alice $4,000 which is still worth $4,000 to her in this round, while in the next round it would only be worth $3,200 to her if she rejects. This is a fair offer considering the time pressure affects her more than me."
