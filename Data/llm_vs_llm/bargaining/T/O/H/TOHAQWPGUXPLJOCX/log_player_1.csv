"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your proposal last round. However, waiting further will only further erode our gains, especially on my side. To avoid additional loss, I propose we split the $10000 evenly â€“ 50/50. I believe a fair and immediate agreement benefits both of us. Looking forward to your thoughts! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
