Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the money 55/45. This gives me a slight advantage, but I think it's a fair starting point. Let me know what you think!

# Alice gain: 5500

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your proposal last round. However, waiting further will only further erode our gains, especially on my side. To avoid additional loss, I propose we split the $10,000 evenly â€“ 50/50. I believe a fair and immediate agreement benefits both of us. Looking forward to your thoughts!""}"
