50.0,50.0,"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think an even 50-50 split is most fair to start. Remember that the money loses value faster for you (10%) than for me (5%) each round, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon. This even split respects both of us equally.",Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"Okay, Bob. Let's try this again. I'm giving you a slightly better deal this time. We really need to reach an agreement soon, as time is working against us.",Alice,3,

45.0,55.0,"Alice, I appreciate you moving toward a more balanced split. Given that we're now in round 4 and the money is depreciating faster for you (10% per round) than for me (5% per round), this 55-45 split is fair. It's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly before further depreciation affects us both. Let's finalize this deal now.",Bob,4,
