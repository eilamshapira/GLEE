Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think an even 50-50 split is most fair to start. Remember that the money loses value faster for you (10%) than for me (5%) each round, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon. This even split respects both of us equally.

# Bob gain: 50

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving toward a more balanced split. Given that we're now in round 4 and the money is depreciating faster for you (10% per round) than for me (5% per round), this 55-45 split is fair. It's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly before further depreciation affects us both. Let's finalize this deal now.
