"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly to make sure we both win! I'm taking a bit more since I have to make the first offer, but this is a good start. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer carefully:

- Alice is offering me $40 out of $100, taking $60 for herself
- If I reject and we move to round 2, the money will be worth 5% less to me
- I need to consider if I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer

Given that:
1. The money's value decreases each round (5% for me, 10% for Alice)
2. I have the advantage of a slower depreciation rate
3. I can make a counter-offer in round 2 that's more favorable to me

While Alice's offer isn't terrible, I believe I can propose a more equitable split if I reject this.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll create a fair counter-offer that acknowledges our situation and the time decay.

```json
{
""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think an even 50-50 split is most fair to start. Remember that the money loses value faster for you (10%) than for me (5%) each round, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon. This even split respects both of us equally.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob. Let's try this again. I'm giving you a slightly better deal this time. We really need to reach an agreement soon, as time is working against us. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer carefully:

- Alice is now offering me $45 (up from $40 in round 1)
- The money is already worth 9.75% less to me than in round 1
- For Alice, it's worth 19% less than in round 1
- The depreciation rates continue to work in my favor
- We're in round 3 of a possible 12 rounds

While Alice has improved her offer, I can likely still get a better deal. Since money depreciates faster for Alice, she has more incentive to agree soon. I believe I can counter with a more favorable offer in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving toward a more balanced split. Given that we're now in round 4 and the money is depreciating faster for you (10% per round) than for me (5% per round), this 55-45 split is fair. It's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly before further depreciation affects us both. Let's finalize this deal now.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Alright, Bob. Let's make a final deal. I suggest a 50/50 split. Let's end it here. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer:

- Alice is now offering me $50 out of $100 (an even split)
- We're in round 5, and my money is worth 18.55% less than in round 1
- Alice's money is worth 34.39% less than in round 1
- The depreciation continues to work in my favor (5% vs 10% per round)
- If I reject, I can make a counter-offer, but we're losing value each round

This is a fair offer - an even 50/50 split. While I could potentially get more by continuing to negotiate, the risks of further depreciation and potentially reaching round 12 with no agreement start to outweigh the marginal gains. Alice has moved significantly from her initial position, and this represents a fair compromise.
