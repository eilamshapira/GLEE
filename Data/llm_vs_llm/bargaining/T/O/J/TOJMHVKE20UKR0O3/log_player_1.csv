Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer to divide the $1,000,000 considering the inflation effect.

I'm offering you $550,000 for me and $450,000 for you, Bob. This is a fair split considering we both want to resolve this quickly, and the 20% inflation penalty would hurt both of us if we delay to another round."
