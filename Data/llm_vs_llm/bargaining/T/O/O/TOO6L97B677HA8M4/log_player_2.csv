"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, let's keep it simple and fair. We each take $5000. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
- It's a perfectly equal split of $5000 each
- If I reject, the total amount will decrease by 10% to $9000 in the next round
- Even if I manage to get a better percentage in the next round, the absolute amount might be lower
- This is a fair offer right from the start, showing good faith
- There's risk in rejecting as Alice might make a less favorable offer later
