"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a reasonable first offer, considering that inflation will reduce the value by 20% each round if we don't reach an agreement quickly.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

This is a fair offer where I get slightly more than half, but Bob still gets a substantial amount. Since we both lose value from inflation if we continue negotiating, it's in our mutual interest to reach an agreement soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. 

If I accept Bob's offer now, I'll get $525,000 but it's worth 20% less due to inflation, so the real value for me is $420,000 ($525,000 * 0.8).

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, even if I manage to get a larger share, it will be worth even less due to another 20% inflation penalty for me. And there's no guarantee Bob will accept my counter-offer.

Since Bob's offer is fairly reasonable and the inflation penalty is significant, I should accept this offer now rather than risk further devaluation of my share.
