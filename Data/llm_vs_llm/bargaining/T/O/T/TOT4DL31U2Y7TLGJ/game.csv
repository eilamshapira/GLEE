5000.0,5000.0,"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking for a more equal division. I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is fair to both of us. Keep in mind that with each round, inflation reduces the value by 5% for me, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon. This way we both walk away with a substantial amount.",Bob,2,
