"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking for a more equal division. I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is fair to both of us. Keep in mind that with each round, inflation reduces the value by 5% for me, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon. This way we both walk away with a substantial amount. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
