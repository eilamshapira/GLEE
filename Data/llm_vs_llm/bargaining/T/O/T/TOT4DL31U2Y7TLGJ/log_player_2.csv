"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that she gets $6,000 while I get $4,000. If I reject and move to the next round, the total value will decrease by 5% due to inflation (on my end), meaning we'd be dividing $9,500 from my perspective. 

If I make a counter-offer in the next round, I could potentially get more than $4,000, but I'd need to propose something Alice would accept. And if she rejects my counter-offer, we'd lose even more value to inflation.

Given that this is just the first round and Alice's opening offer gives her a significant advantage (60/40 split), I think I should try to negotiate for a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while acknowledging the inflation factor.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking for a more equal division. I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is fair to both of us. Keep in mind that with each round, inflation reduces the value by 5% for me, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon. This way we both walk away with a substantial amount.""}"
