475000.0,525000.0,"Hi Alice, since money loses 5% value for you each round but not for me, it's in your interest to agree now rather than later. I'm offering you $475000, which is more valuable than a higher amount in future rounds. This is fair given our different inflation rates.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Bob, it's clear we both want to maximize our gains. I propose a 50/50 split to avoid further losses from inflation. This is a fair deal.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, let's finalize this deal. With each round, your share loses 5% in value due to inflation, while mine doesn't. If we go another round, your potential $500000 would effectively be worth only about $427500 to you. My offer of $450000 now is actually more valuable to you than getting $500000 in the next round. This is a fair offer that accounts for our different inflation rates.",Bob,4,

475000.0,525000.0,"Bob, I understand the impact of inflation, and I'm willing to accept a slight disadvantage to finalize this now. Let's agree to your previous offer of 475000 for me and 525000 for you.  Prolonging this will only hurt us both.",Alice,5,
