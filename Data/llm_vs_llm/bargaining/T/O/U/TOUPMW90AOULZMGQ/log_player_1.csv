Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since money loses 5% value for you each round but not for me, it's in your interest to agree now rather than later. I'm offering you $475000, which is more valuable than a higher amount in future rounds. This is fair given our different inflation rates. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's finalize this deal. With each round, your share loses 5% in value due to inflation, while mine doesn't. If we go another round, your potential $500000 would effectively be worth only about $427500 to you. My offer of $450000 now is actually more valuable to you than getting $500000 in the next round. This is a fair offer that accounts for our different inflation rates. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000
