5500.0,4500.0,Let's split fairly but slightly in my favor considering the inflation. A deal now is better than risking getting nothing later.,Alice,1,

5000.0,5000.0,"I propose a fair 50-50 split. This gives us both $5000, which is equitable. While I understand your concern about inflation, we're only in round 2, so you'll still get nearly full value. This is a balanced solution that respects both our interests.",Bob,2,

5800.0,4200.0,"Bob, I appreciate the attempt at fairness, but inflation puts me at a disadvantage. Let's meet in the middle - my offer recognizes the time pressure while still leaving you with a good amount.",Alice,3,

5200.0,4800.0,"Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. I'm meeting you part way with a 48-52 split that acknowledges your time pressure while still being fair to both of us. At round 4, you'll still get good value from your $5200, and we can both walk away satisfied rather than risking getting nothing in later rounds.",Bob,4,

6000.0,4000.0,"Bob, we're getting closer. My offer reflects the increasing time pressure. Let's be pragmatic and close the deal now, ensuring a good outcome for both of us.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
5300.0,4700.0,"Alice, I see we're at an impasse. Let me improve my offer to a 47-53 split. With the current inflation rate of about 35%, your $5300 is worth about $3477 in original value to you, while I get $4700. This is fair considering we're halfway through our rounds, and the risk of getting nothing is increasing. This offer balances your inflation concerns with my interests - let's finalize and both walk away with something substantial.",Bob,6,
