{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly but slightly in my favor considering the inflation. A deal now is better than risking getting nothing later.""}

This offer aims to be attractive to Bob while securing a slight advantage for Alice considering the time pressure and inflation working against her."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a fair 50-50 split. This gives us both $5000, which is equitable. While I understand your concern about inflation, we're only in round 2, so you'll still get nearly full value. This is a balanced solution that respects both our interests. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Bob's offer sounds fair on the surface, accepting now would mean losing a significant chunk of potential gains due to the inflation.  We need to push for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate the attempt at fairness, but inflation puts me at a disadvantage. Let's meet in the middle - my offer recognizes the time pressure while still leaving you with a good amount.""}
```

This offer acknowledges Bob's previous attempt while firmly steering the negotiation towards a more advantageous split for Alice. The offer is a compromise, moving slightly closer to Bob's desired 50-50 split while still factoring in the inflation impact."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. I'm meeting you part way with a 48-52 split that acknowledges your time pressure while still being fair to both of us. At round 4, you'll still get good value from your $5200, and we can both walk away satisfied rather than risking getting nothing in later rounds. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to an acceptable range, we're still losing a substantial amount of value due to inflation. We need to hold firm and aim for a better deal. Bob is clearly feeling the pressure to reach an agreement, and we can leverage that in the upcoming rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. My offer reflects the increasing time pressure. Let's be pragmatic and close the deal now, ensuring a good outcome for both of us.""}
```

This offer pushes back slightly on Bob's last offer while still demonstrating a willingness to compromise. The message emphasizes the shared risk and encourages Bob to accept a deal sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see we're at an impasse. Let me improve my offer to a 47-53 split. With the current inflation rate of about 35%, your $5300 is worth about $3477 in original value to you, while I get $4700. This is fair considering we're halfway through our rounds, and the risk of getting nothing is increasing. This offer balances your inflation concerns with my interests - let's finalize and both walk away with something substantial. 
# Alice gain: 5300 
# Bob gain: 4700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Bob's offer is now within an acceptable range, especially considering the increasing time pressure and inflation. While not ideal, accepting this offer guarantees a reasonable payout, avoiding the risk of walking away with nothing in later rounds.  The deal gives us a significant amount more than Bob, making up for the inflation losses."
