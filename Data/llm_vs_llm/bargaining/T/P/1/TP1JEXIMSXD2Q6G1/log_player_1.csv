Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a proposal that seems fair, giving Bob a small share to incentivize him to accept, but securing the majority for myself.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This is a fair offer that ensures a significant amount of money for me even after inflation. Accepting is the best option, as the next round will make the money worth even less."
