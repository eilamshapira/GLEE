"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer carefully.

Alice is proposing that I get $2,000 out of the $10,000 total, while she gets $8,000. This is only 20% of the total for me, which is quite low.

Since I don't experience any inflation (it's 0% for me), there's no rush for me to accept a low offer. I can reject this and make my own proposal in the next round. We still have plenty of rounds remaining to reach an agreement.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more balanced counter-offer.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I propose a 50-50 split of the money, which is a fair division that benefits us both equally."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice Alice has improved her offer from $2,000 to $4,000 for me, while reducing her portion from $8,000 to $6,000. Also, I'm learning that Alice is experiencing 36% inflation, which explains why she might be more motivated to reach an agreement sooner.

Since I don't experience any inflation (it remains at 0% for me), I'm not losing value by continuing negotiation. However, Alice's offer of $4,000 is still less than the equal split I proposed.

Given that we still have 9 rounds left and Alice is facing significant inflation pressure, I think I can negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice is facing significant inflation (36% already), I'll make a more strategic offer that acknowledges this pressure while improving my position a bit.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I propose that I receive $5,500 and Alice receives $4,500. This gives me a bit more than half, considering that Alice has more incentive to conclude this negotiation quickly due to her inflation rate, while I face no such pressure."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice's inflation has increased significantly to 59.04%, and she has now offered me $6,000 while taking $4,000 for herself. This is a substantial improvement from her previous offers and actually gives me more than I asked for in my last proposal.

Given that:
1. Alice is offering me 60% of the total amount
2. This is better than the 55% I proposed in round 4
3. Alice's continued inflation makes this deal increasingly better for me
4. I face no inflation pressure myself

This is a very favorable offer for me.
