"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair split. What do you say, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer and the game's inflation rules. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100, while keeping $60 for herself.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me but only 10% less to Alice. This means:
- If I accept now: I get $40
- If I wait one round: The $100 becomes worth $80 to me and $90 to Alice

Given the asymmetric inflation rates that disadvantage me more than Alice, I should carefully consider accepting a reasonable offer now rather than facing diminished value later.

While Alice's offer isn't an even split, getting $40 now might be better than trying to negotiate for more with the significant inflation penalty I face.
