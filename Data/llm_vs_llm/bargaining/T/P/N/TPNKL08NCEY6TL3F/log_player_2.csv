"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is proposing I get $400,000 out of the $1,000,000, while she takes $600,000. If I reject and move to the next round, I'll face 20% inflation on my share, but I would get to make the next proposal.

My potential share in this round: $400,000
If I reject and propose next round: I could propose a higher amount, but it would be worth 20% less to me.

Given the significant inflation penalty and the reasonable offer (I'm getting 40% of the total), I'll accept this offer.
