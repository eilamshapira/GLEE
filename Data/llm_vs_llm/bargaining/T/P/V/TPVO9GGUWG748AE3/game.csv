480000.0,520000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we settle the division in Round 1. You receive $520000 and I receive $480000. This way, we both avoid the cost of delay—especially since my share loses 5% value with every round. I hope you find this offer fair and wise given the circumstances. Looking forward to your thoughts!",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Alice, thanks for your proposal - it seems like you're keen to settle this quickly. While I appreciate your offer, I'm also feeling the pressure of the clock. How about we split the difference a bit more in this round? I propose $550000 for me and $450000 for you.  Let me know what you think!",Bob,2,
,,"Bob’s proposal gives me an effective share of about $427500 in first‐round value—a significant drop from the $480000 I proposed in Round 1. Given that my money is only devalued by 5% per round compared to Bob’s 10%, I believe I stand a better chance of crafting a more favorable proposal in Round 3 while Bob faces harsher inflation. Consequently, I’m opting to reject this offer.",Alice,2,reject
411000.0,589000.0,"Hi Bob, as we enter Round 3 the devaluation hits my share by 10% while—based on last round—your money appears to be suffering about a 15% hit if we delay further. To avoid further losses, I’m proposing a division where you get $589000 (which, even after a 15% discount, is roughly $500650 in first‐round value) while I take $411000 (about $369900 in first‐round value). This offer gives you a competitive edge compared to waiting for the next round, and I believe it signals a fair move to lock in our agreement before more value evaporates. I’m optimistic we can settle this now. –Alice",Alice,3,

400000.0,600000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. It seems like we both want to avoid letting this money disappear to inflation.  To that end, I propose a split of $600000 for me and $400000 for you. This feels like a fair offer considering the circumstances. What do you say?",Bob,4,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to resolve this, but I must pass on your current offer. With the inflation adjustments now—my share having dropped by only 14.26% compared to your 27.1%—I think we both stand to benefit from further negotiation. I’m confident that if we delay one more round, I can craft an offer that leverages our differing devaluations. Let’s keep working toward a more balanced settlement for both of us. –Alice",Alice,4,reject
430000.0,570000.0,"Hi Bob, in Round 5 the stakes are even higher due to inflation. Based on our observed factors, my money now retains about 81.45% of its original value (0.95⁴) while yours retains roughly 65.61% (0.9⁴). In today’s nominal terms, I’m proposing that you receive $570000 and I receive $430000. This translates to an effective first-round value of about $527600 for me and $868800 for you. I believe this offer safeguards you against further losses from inflation while still improving my position relative to earlier proposals. Let’s settle now before the value drops even more. –Alice",Alice,5,

420000.0,580000.0,"Alice, it seems like we're reaching a critical point in this negotiation.  Let's be completely transparent with each other. We both know the inflation rate is impacting our potential gains.  I'm proposing a final offer: $580000 for me and $420000 for you. This is a fair deal that acknowledges the time pressure we're both under. If you're not on board with this, I'm going to have to significantly lower my expectations in the coming rounds to ensure I don't walk away empty-handed.",Bob,6,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your transparency and the urgency in your offer. However, considering that my share now retains roughly 77.38% of its original value while yours falls to about 59.05%, I believe there’s room to find a division that better reflects these differences. I’m inclined to hold out for a revised agreement in the next round that more equitably balances the devaluation we’re experiencing. –Alice",Alice,6,reject
410000.0,590000.0,"Hi Bob, as we move into Round 7 the inflation pressures are becoming even more severe. Based on updated calculations, my money is now worth roughly 26% less than in Round 1 while your money suffers about a 47% reduction. In nominal terms, I'm proposing a division where you receive $590000 and I receive $410000. This means your money is effectively worth about 590000 × 0.534 ≈ $315000 in first‐round value, while mine is about 410000 × 0.737 ≈ $302000. I believe this split gives you a slight effective edge, which is important as further rounds would only worsen your position due to steeper inflation. I hope we can agree on this deal and close the negotiation promptly. –Alice",Alice,7,
