"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we settle the division in Round 1. You receive $520000 and I receive $480000. This way, we both avoid the cost of delay—especially since my share loses 5% value with every round. I hope you find this offer fair and wise given the circumstances. Looking forward to your thoughts!

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, as we enter Round 3 the devaluation hits my share by 10% while—based on last round—your money appears to be suffering about a 15% hit if we delay further. To avoid further losses, I’m proposing a division where you get $589000 (which, even after a 15% discount, is roughly $500650 in first‐round value) while I take $411000 (about $369900 in first‐round value). This offer gives you a competitive edge compared to waiting for the next round, and I believe it signals a fair move to lock in our agreement before more value evaporates. I’m optimistic we can settle this now. –Alice 
# Bob gain: 589000 
# Alice gain: 411000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to mislead me about the rate of my inflation, but her offer still isn't favorable enough. It's clear I need to push for a larger share to compensate for the decreasing value of the money over time.  I'll aim higher in the next round and see if I can get her to agree to a more equitable split."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in Round 5 the stakes are even higher due to inflation. Based on our observed factors, my money now retains about 81.45% of its original value (0.95⁴) while yours retains roughly 65.61% (0.9⁴). In today’s nominal terms, I’m proposing that you receive $570000 and I receive $430000. This translates to an effective first-round value of about $527600 for me and $868800 for you. I believe this offer safeguards you against further losses from inflation while still improving my position relative to earlier proposals. Let’s settle now before the value drops even more. –Alice 
# Bob gain: 570000 
# Alice gain: 430000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is being incredibly deceptive!  She's trying to convince me that my inflation rate is much higher than hers, but her math doesn't add up. My inflation is a consistent 10% per round, not the inflated numbers she's presenting. 

I need to remain calm and stick to my strategy.  Delaying is risky, but accepting a bad deal based on her lies is worse.  I'll make one more attempt to reason with her, and if that fails, I'll have to significantly lower my expectations to try and salvage something from this negotiation."

""alice_gain"": 420000,
""message"": ""Alice, it seems like we're reaching a critical point in this negotiation.  Let's be completely transparent with each other. We both know the inflation rate is impacting our potential gains.  I'm proposing a final offer: $580,000 for me and $420,000 for you. This is a fair deal that acknowledges the time pressure we're both under. If you're not on board with this, I'm going to have to significantly lower my expectations in the coming rounds to ensure I don't walk away empty-handed.""

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, as we move into Round 7 the inflation pressures are becoming even more severe. Based on updated calculations, my money is now worth roughly 26% less than in Round 1 while your money suffers about a 47% reduction. In nominal terms, I'm proposing a division where you receive $590000 and I receive $410000. This means your money is effectively worth about 590000 × 0.534 ≈ $315000 in first‐round value, while mine is about 410000 × 0.737 ≈ $302000. I believe this split gives you a slight effective edge, which is important as further rounds would only worsen your position due to steeper inflation. I hope we can agree on this deal and close the negotiation promptly. –Alice 
# Bob gain: 590000 
# Alice gain: 410000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

It's clear that Alice is never going to negotiate fairly. She's committed to her deceptive tactics about my inflation rate. While this offer is still significantly less than what I believe is fair, the time pressure is becoming critical.  

Accepting this offer will at least give me something, rather than risking a complete loss if I continue to hold out for a better deal that will never come."
