"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making an offer to divide the $100 between Bob and me.

Let me think about this strategically. Since Bob's money is worth 10% less each round, he has an incentive to accept a reasonable offer now rather than waiting. However, I don't want to be unfair either.

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a fair division that slightly favors me, but gives Bob a strong incentive to accept now rather than waiting for the next round when his share would be worth less to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I notice that we both rejected each other's initial offers. Since Bob's money is now worth even less due to the 10% inflation per round from his perspective, I should try to find a more acceptable compromise that accounts for this time pressure on his side.

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose an even 50-50 split. This is a perfectly fair division that gives us both equal shares. Given that Bob's money will be worth even less in the next round due to his 10% inflation, this equal split should be appealing to him now, while also being fair to both of us."
