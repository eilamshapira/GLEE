Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice – to avoid further losses from inflation, I propose a near‐fair split. With both of us losing 5% value each round, accepting this division (512820 for me and 487180 for you) ensures we both secure our best possible value without delay. I look forward to a swift agreement! 
# Alice gain: 487180 
# Bob gain: 512820 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was rejected, it's now my turn again. Considering the inflation effect on Bob's gain, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 650000,
  ""bob_gain"": 350000,
  ""message"": ""Bob, your loss due to inflation is increasing. Accept this offer to minimize your losses.""
}
