"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 2. Remember, the value of the money is now diminished for both of us.

The initial $10,000 has lost 20% of its value for me and 10% for Alice. This means my share is now worth 80% of its original value, and Alice's share is worth 90%.

Here's the offer:

```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""alice_gain"": 5000
}
