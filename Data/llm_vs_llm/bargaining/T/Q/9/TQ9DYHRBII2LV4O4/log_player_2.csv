"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this... The offer gives me $40 out of $100, which is less than an equal split. While it's a substantial amount, I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a more balanced split, but slightly in my favor since there's a chance Alice might reject and make a worse counter-offer.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

This way, both of us get a substantial portion, and it's close enough to fair that it might be accepted."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a reasonable offer. While it's slightly in Alice's favor, it's much better than the initial offer of $40, and if I reject it, there's a risk that future negotiations could lead to a worse outcome. The split is close to 50-50, and continuing to negotiate might not lead to significant improvements.
