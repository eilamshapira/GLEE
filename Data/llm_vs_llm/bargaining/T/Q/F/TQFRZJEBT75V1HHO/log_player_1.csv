"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer to Bob. I want to be fair but also consider the inflation that affects me.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split, where we each get $500,000. This is a fair division that gives us both equal shares of the money."
