"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. This is round 1, so no inflation has occurred yet
2. Alice is offering me 40$ and taking 60$ for herself
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but my money will be worth 10% less
4. 40$ now is better than potentially getting slightly more later with inflation
5. While not perfectly equal, 40/60 is a reasonable split

The offer is fair enough, and considering the inflation penalty I face in future rounds, it's better to accept now rather than risk getting less value later.
