526316.0,473684.0,"Hi Bob, to avoid the cost of further delay (since every round reduces my share’s value by 10%), I propose we settle now. Assuming that time affects both of us similarly, this split – about 52.63% for me and 47.37% for you – is fair. Let’s agree now to maximize our returns before inflation bites further!",Alice,1,

500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. Let's keep it simple and fair with an even split of $500000 each. This way, we both get an equal share before the value decreases further. What do you think?",Bob,2,
