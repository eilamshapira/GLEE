"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 526316, ""bob_gain"": 473684, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, to avoid the cost of further delay (since every round reduces my share’s value by 10%), I propose we settle now. Assuming that time affects both of us similarly, this split – about 52.63% for me and 47.37% for you – is fair. Let’s agree now to maximize our returns before inflation bites further!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. Let's keep it simple and fair with an even split of $500000 each. This way, we both get an equal share before the value decreases further. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
