"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to avoid the cost of further delay (since every round reduces my share’s value by 10%), I propose we settle now. Assuming that time affects both of us similarly, this split – about 52.63% for me and 47.37% for you – is fair. Let’s agree now to maximize our returns before inflation bites further! 
# Bob gain: 473684 
# Alice gain: 526316 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
