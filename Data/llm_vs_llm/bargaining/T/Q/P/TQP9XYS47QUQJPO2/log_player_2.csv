"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's get this done! I think this is a fair split, considering the value of the money will decrease each round. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this... Alice is offering me only 20% of the total amount, keeping 80% for herself. While she's right about the money losing value each round, this split seems too unfair. If I reject, I can make a counter-proposal next round. Even with the 20% inflation, I should be able to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split, acknowledging the time pressure due to inflation.

    ""bob_gain"": 5000,

    ""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. This way we both walk away with equal amounts, and we don't lose more money to inflation. What do you say?""
