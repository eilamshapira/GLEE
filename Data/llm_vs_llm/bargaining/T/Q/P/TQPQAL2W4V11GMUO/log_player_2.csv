"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

The offer gives me $45 and Alice $55. If I reject and we go to the next round:
- I can make a counter-offer
- The money will be worth 10% less to Alice (but same value to me)
- This means Alice would only value a $55 share as $49.50 in the next round

Since I can likely get a better deal by making a counter-offer, and Alice will be more inclined to accept due to the 10% devaluation she faces...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice faces a 10% devaluation per round, she should be more willing to accept a less favorable split now rather than risk further devaluation. A $45 share in this round is worth more to her than a $50 share in the next round (which would only be worth $45 to her due to the 10% devaluation).

I'll propose a split that's slightly more in my favor but still reasonable enough that Alice should accept given the time pressure she faces.

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I propose this split because:
1. The $40 Alice would get now is worth more to her than waiting another round where her money would be worth even less
2. It's not so extreme that she would definitely reject it
3. It improves my position from the original offer"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is offering me $55, which is better than her initial offer of $45
2. The $45 Alice would get is actually worth only about $36.45 to her due to the 19% inflation she faces
3. If I reject:
   - I can make another offer in round 4
   - Alice's money will be worth even less (29% less than initial)
   - However, Alice might become more aggressive in her offers due to the increasing devaluation

Since I'm getting a majority share ($55) and this is a significant improvement from the initial offer, and there's some risk in pushing further, I'll accept this offer.
