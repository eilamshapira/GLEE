50.0,50.0,"Let's start fair, 50-50 split. What do you say, Bob?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"Alice, consider this: waiting another round means you'll lose 10% of your share's value. I propose that I take $60 and you get $40 from the $100. Accepting now secures you $40 at full value versus a diminished amount later. Let's settle this quickly and move on.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
45.0,55.0,"Bob, since you're keen on a quicker resolution and considering the inflation affecting my share, I propose a 45-55 split in your favor. This way, you get more than half, and I still secure a reasonable amount before it devalues further. Let's end this now.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
1.0,99.0,"Alice, I know you’d like to steer the deal in your favor in upcoming rounds, but remember: every round you wait further, your share loses an extra 10% of its value. In round 5, as the proposer, you'll be forced to offer Bob nearly everything because his portion isn’t discounted at all. By accepting 1 dollar now—which is worth about 0.73 of a dollar relative to round 1—you secure something rather than risking ending up with nothing. Let’s conclude this round and avoid further loss.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
30.0,70.0,"Bob, considering the rapid devaluation of my share and your insistence on a swift conclusion, I'm offering a 30-70 split in your favor. This gives you a significant portion while still leaving me with something before it loses even more value. Let's settle this now before it's too late.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
1.0,99.0,"Alice, understand that every round you delay further reduces your share's actual worth. If you reject this offer, your prospects in the next rounds are even bleaker due to compounded devaluation—with you effectively losing almost all value. Accepting $1 now (worth about $0.59 in today's terms for you) is far better than ending up with nothing in the subsequent rounds. Let's settle this round and avoid further loss.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
20.0,80.0,"Bob, with my share now significantly devalued, I'm willing to offer you an 80-20 split. This way, you get the lion's share, and I still walk away with something before it's worth even less. Let's end this now.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
1.0,99.0,"Alice, if you reject this offer, you become the proposer in round 9—but you'll face a harsh reality. In round 9, given the further devaluation of your money (now worth only about 47.83% of its original value), I hold such a strong bargaining position that you'd be forced to offer me nearly everything to get me to accept. That means your eventual payoff would be virtually zero. Accepting $1 now guarantees you something rather than nothing. Let's settle this deal promptly.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
10.0,90.0,"Bob, my share is now worth significantly less, and we're running out of time. I'm proposing a 90-10 split in your favor. This ensures you get the vast majority, and I still get something before it's too late. Let's end this now.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
15.0,85.0,"Alice, we're now in round 10 and every extra round further erodes the actual value of your share. By accepting $15 now, you secure more real value than if you wait to propose in round 11 — where the inevitable additional inflation will leave you with even less. This deal is my way of giving you a better immediate outcome, avoiding the harsh devaluation you'd face later. Let’s settle and preserve as much as we can.",Bob,10,
