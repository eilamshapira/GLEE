Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, consider this: waiting another round means you'll lose 10% of your share's value. I propose that I take $60 and you get $40 from the $100. Accepting now secures you $40 at full value versus a diminished amount later. Let's settle this quickly and move on. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know you’d like to steer the deal in your favor in upcoming rounds, but remember: every round you wait further, your share loses an extra 10% of its value. In round 5, as the proposer, you'll be forced to offer Bob nearly everything because his portion isn’t discounted at all. By accepting 1 dollar now—which is worth about 0.73 of a dollar relative to round 1—you secure something rather than risking ending up with nothing. Let’s conclude this round and avoid further loss. 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99

  ""message"": ""Bob, considering the rapid devaluation of my share and your insistence on a swift conclusion, I'm offering a 30-70 split in your favor.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, understand that every round you delay further reduces your share's actual worth. If you reject this offer, your prospects in the next rounds are even bleaker due to compounded devaluation—with you effectively losing almost all value. Accepting $1 now (worth about $0.59 in today's terms for you) is far better than ending up with nothing in the subsequent rounds. Let's settle this round and avoid further loss.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, if you reject this offer, you become the proposer in round 9—but you'll face a harsh reality. In round 9, given the further devaluation of your money (now worth only about 47.83% of its original value), I hold such a strong bargaining position that you'd be forced to offer me nearly everything to get me to accept. That means your eventual payoff would be virtually zero. Accepting $1 now guarantees you something rather than nothing. Let's settle this deal promptly. 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're now in round 10 and every extra round further erodes the actual value of your share. By accepting $15 now, you secure more real value than if you wait to propose in round 11 — where the inevitable additional inflation will leave you with even less. This deal is my way of giving you a better immediate outcome, avoiding the harsh devaluation you'd face later. Let’s settle and preserve as much as we can.

# Bob gain: 85
