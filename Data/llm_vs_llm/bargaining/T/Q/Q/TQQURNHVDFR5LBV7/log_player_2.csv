Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, consider this: waiting another round means you'll lose 10% of your share's value. I propose that I take $60 and you get $40 from the $100. Accepting now secures you $40 at full value versus a diminished amount later. Let's settle this quickly and move on.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, since you're keen on a quicker resolution and considering the inflation affecting my share, I propose a 45-55 split in your favor. This way, you get more than half, and I still secure a reasonable amount before it devalues further. Let's end this now.

# Alice gain: 45

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 99, ""alice_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Alice, I know you’d like to steer the deal in your favor in upcoming rounds, but remember: every round you wait further, your share loses an extra 10% of its value. In round 5, as the proposer, you'll be forced to offer Bob nearly everything because his portion isn’t discounted at all. By accepting 1 dollar now—which is worth about 0.73 of a dollar relative to round 1—you secure something rather than risking ending up with nothing. Let’s conclude this round and avoid further loss.""}"

Round 5

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering the rapid devaluation of my share and your insistence on a swift conclusion, I'm offering a 30-70 split in your favor. This gives you a significant portion while still leaving me with something before it loses even more value. Let's settle this now before it's too late.

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 99, ""alice_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Alice, understand that every round you delay further reduces your share's actual worth. If you reject this offer, your prospects in the next rounds are even bleaker due to compounded devaluation—with you effectively losing almost all value. Accepting $1 now (worth about $0.59 in today's terms for you) is far better than ending up with nothing in the subsequent rounds. Let's settle this round and avoid further loss.""}"

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 99, ""alice_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Alice, if you reject this offer, you become the proposer in round 9—but you'll face a harsh reality. In round 9, given the further devaluation of your money (now worth only about 47.83% of its original value), I hold such a strong bargaining position that you'd be forced to offer me nearly everything to get me to accept. That means your eventual payoff would be virtually zero. Accepting $1 now guarantees you something rather than nothing. Let's settle this deal promptly.""}"

Round 10

This deal is my way of giving you a better immediate outcome, avoiding the harsh devaluation you'd face later. Let’s settle and preserve as much as we can.""}"
