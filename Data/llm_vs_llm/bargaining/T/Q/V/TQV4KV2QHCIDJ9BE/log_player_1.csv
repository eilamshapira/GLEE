"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that Bob faces a 5% depreciation per round while I don't, I should make a strategic first offer that considers this factor. I'll propose a split that's slightly in my favor but not so extreme that Bob would definitely reject it.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

This offer gives Bob a substantial portion ($400,000) while keeping the larger share for myself. If Bob rejects this offer, their next counteroffer would be dealing with money that's worth 5% less to them, which might make them more inclined to accept this reasonable first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 490000 
# Bob gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Bob offers me $490,000 (worth full value to me)
2. Bob wants $510,000 (worth only 95% of its nominal value to them, so effectively worth $484,500 to them)
3. If I reject, we go to round 3, where:
   - The money will still be worth 100% to me
   - The money will be worth only 90% to Bob
   - I can make the next offer

Bob's current offer is fairly balanced, but I believe I can get a better deal by rejecting and making a new offer in round 3, taking advantage of the increasing inflation pressure on Bob.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob rejected my first offer of 600k/400k, and I rejected their 490k/510k offer, I'll now make a stronger offer in my favor, leveraging the fact that the money is now worth only 90% to Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}

This offer gives Bob $350,000 (which is worth $315,000 to them due to the 10% cumulative depreciation), while I get $650,000 at full value. This is a reasonable offer considering:
1. The depreciation effect on Bob's side
2. I have the power to make the offer this round
3. If Bob rejects, they'll face even more depreciation (15%) in the next round

The declining value of money for Bob should make them more inclined to accept this offer now rather than risk further depreciation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 485000 
# Bob gain: 515000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Bob offers me $485,000 (worth full value to me)
2. Bob wants $515,000 (worth only 85.74% of its nominal value to them, so effectively worth $441,561 to them)
3. If I reject, we go to round 5, where:
   - The money will still be worth 100% to me
   - The money will be worth even less to Bob (about 19% less than original value)
   - I can make the next offer

Given that Bob is facing significant depreciation and I can make an even stronger offer in the next round due to the increasing inflation pressure, I should reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that the money is now worth about 81% of its original value to Bob, and they've rejected my previous offers, I'll adjust my offer to be even more aggressive while still being potentially acceptable to Bob given their deteriorating position.

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

This offer is strategic because:
1. Bob's $300,000 is now worth only about $243,000 to them due to the ~19% depreciation
2. If Bob rejects this offer, they'll face even more depreciation in the next round (around 24%)
3. I maintain full value of my $700,000
4. Bob's previous offers show they're trying to hold out, but the increasing depreciation makes their position increasingly untenable

The significant depreciation effect should make this offer more appealing to Bob than waiting for future rounds where their purchasing power will continue to decrease."
