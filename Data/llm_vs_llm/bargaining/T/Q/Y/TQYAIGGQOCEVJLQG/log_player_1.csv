Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a fair split that acknowledges your first-mover advantage. This is much more equitable than your initial offer, and considering we both face inflation penalties, it's in our mutual interest to reach a reasonable agreement soon. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
