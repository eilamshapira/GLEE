"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take the lion's share, but I'm willing to let you have a small piece.  Accept this, and we can both walk away with something. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me 100,000$ while taking 900,000$ for herself
2. If I reject, in the next round I can make a counter-offer
3. The money will be worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Alice in the next round
4. My 100,000$ now is worth more than 120,000$ in the next round due to inflation

However, this offer is quite unfair. Since I have the opportunity to make a counter-offer and the inflation rate affects Alice too (though less severely), I believe I can get a better deal by rejecting this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a more balanced offer. Since we both face inflation (though at different rates), it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon. I'll propose a more equitable split while acknowledging Alice's first-mover advantage.

{""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""I propose a fair split that acknowledges your first-mover advantage. This is much more equitable than your initial offer, and considering we both face inflation penalties, it's in our mutual interest to reach a reasonable agreement soon.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still want a larger share. With each round, we both lose more, so let's get this done. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has increased her offer from 100,000$ to 250,000$
2. Due to 36% inflation for me, this 250,000$ is worth about the same as 160,000$ from round 1
3. If I reject, the next round will have even higher inflation (20% more for me, 5% more for Alice)
4. We've already used 3 rounds out of 12, and the gap between our inflation rates means waiting longer primarily hurts me

While this offer is still not entirely fair, the increasing inflation rate is significantly eroding my bargaining power. Given that my inflation rate (20% per round) is much higher than Alice's (5% per round), continuing to negotiate will hurt me more than it hurts Alice.
