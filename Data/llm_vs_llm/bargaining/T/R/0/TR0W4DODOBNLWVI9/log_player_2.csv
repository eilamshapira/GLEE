"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100, which is less than half. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but I need to account for the 20% inflation that affects me each round.

If I reject now, the total value will be worth 80% of the original amount to me in the next round. So the $100 would effectively be worth $80 to me, and I'd need to propose a division of that.

Let me think - $40 now might be better than risking further rounds with diminishing returns due to inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair offer that accounts for the inflation I'm facing. Since Alice offered me 40% in the first round, I'll propose a more balanced split that gives me a bit more but isn't too aggressive.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split of the $100, which is fair for both of us. This gives you $50, which is significantly more than the $40 I was offered, and I also get $50. Since I'm facing 20% inflation each round, it's important that we reach an agreement quickly, and I believe an equal split is a reasonable compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this carefully. Alice is now offering me $45, which is better than her initial offer of $40, but still less than the 50-50 split I proposed.

Due to inflation affecting me, the money is now worth 36% less to me than in round 1. This means $45 now is equivalent to $45 Ã— (1 - 0.36) = $28.80 in original value.

If I reject and we go to round 4, the inflation will increase further, and the total value of any agreement will decrease for me. Alice seems to be facing less inflation (19%) than I am (36%), which gives her some advantage in later rounds.

Given that the gap between our positions has narrowed and I'm facing significant inflation, accepting $45 now is likely better than risking further devaluation.
