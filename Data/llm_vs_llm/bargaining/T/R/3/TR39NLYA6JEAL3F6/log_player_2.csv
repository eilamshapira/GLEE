"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split that gives me the majority but also recognizes your contribution. Let's get this done quickly. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each round, I'll make a more generous offer to Alice to incentivize her to accept quickly. 

{""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 40-60, a reasonable compromise considering the decreasing value""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but 60/40 is still too much in your favor. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the 19% decrease in value due to inflation, my effective gain would be approximately 241000 (300000 * 0.81). 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 19% less for me after 3 rounds (10% decrease in round 2 and another 9.1% decrease, 10% of 900000,  in round 3, for a cumulative 28.1% decrease, approximately), and I rejected the previous offer, I'll make a more generous offer to Alice to incentivize her to accept quickly, while also considering my own decreasing value.
