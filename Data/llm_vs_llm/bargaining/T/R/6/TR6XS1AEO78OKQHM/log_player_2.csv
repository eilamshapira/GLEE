"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this situation. 

Alice is offering a 50-50 split, which might seem fair at first glance. But I need to consider the inflation aspect of this game.

For me (Bob), there's no inflation penalty - the money maintains its value across rounds. For Alice, the money loses 5% of its value each round.

If I reject this offer and we go to another round, I could potentially propose a split that gives me more than $5000. Since Alice faces a 5% inflation penalty, she might be more inclined to accept a less equal offer in the next round rather than lose more value.

Given this strategic advantage, I think I should reject Alice's 50-50 split and make my own proposal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer that acknowledges Alice's inflation disadvantage while still improving my position. Since Alice will lose 5% of the value in this round, I should propose a split that's better than what she would get by rejecting and facing further inflation, but also better for me than the 50-50 split.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I'm proposing that I get $5,500 and Alice gets $4,500. This is reasonable because if Alice rejects this offer, in the next round the $4,500 would only be worth $4,275 to her due to the 5% inflation. Since I'm not affected by inflation, this offer is better for me than the initial 50-50 split, while still being attractive enough for Alice to accept rather than continue to a round where she faces further value loss."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5750 
# Alice gain: 4250 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation carefully.

Alice is now offering me $5,750 while taking $4,250 for herself. This is actually a better deal for me than what I proposed in the previous round ($5,500).

It seems Alice has recognized that due to her 9.75% inflation penalty at this point, she needs to offer me more to reach an agreement. If I reject and we go to round 4, I could potentially get an even better deal, but there's also a risk that we keep going back and forth, which would hurt Alice more than me due to the increasing inflation penalty she faces.

Since this offer gives me more than my previous proposal and significantly more than the initial 50-50 split, I should accept it.
