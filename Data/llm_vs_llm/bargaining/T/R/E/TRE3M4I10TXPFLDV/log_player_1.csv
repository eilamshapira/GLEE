Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I suggest a fair 50-50 split. This way we both benefit equally, and it's better than risking further inflation losses for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
