"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly. I think 60 for me, 40 for you is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer gives me $40
2. If I reject and move to next round:
   * Money will be worth 20% less for me
   * I can make a counter-offer
   * Maximum I could get in next round would be worth $80 * 0.8 = $64
   * But Alice might reject that

$40 is a reasonable offer, but slightly unfair. Given I can propose next and the inflation isn't too punishing yet, I'll try to negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split while being reasonable:

{""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""I suggest a fair 50-50 split. This way we both benefit equally, and it's better than risking further inflation losses for both of us.""}

The reasoning for this offer:
1. It's a perfectly fair split that's hard to argue against
2. If Alice rejects, she'll face the same inflation problem I just faced
3. Even with inflation, a 50-50 split now is better than a worse split later
4. The message emphasizes fairness and mutual benefit"
