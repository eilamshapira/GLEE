"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to make an offer to Bob, keeping in mind the inflation that affects me each round. I want to maximize my potential gain while also making the offer appealing enough for Bob to accept, especially since I don't know how inflation affects him.

Here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

Rationale:

*   I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a significant amount. This makes the offer attractive and increases the likelihood of acceptance.
*   I'm keeping $600,000 for myself. Given the potential for inflation in later rounds, securing this amount now is beneficial.
*   Since this is the first round, there is no inflation effect yet, so the full $600,000 is mine if he accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob rejected my offer and now he's made a counter-offer. I need to consider the inflation that's affecting *my* gains, while his gains are unaffected.

Here's my decision:

```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Rationale:

*   **My inflation:** The money I gain now is worth 10% less than in round 1. So, $400,000 in this round is equivalent to $400,000 * 0.9 = $360,000 in round 1 dollars.
*   **Bob's offer:** Bob is offering me $400,000.
*   **Decision:** Accepting $400,000 (worth $360,000 in round 1 terms) is better than risking further inflation in subsequent rounds and potentially ending up with nothing. It's also a decent amount to secure."
