"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get a substantial amount right away without risking inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the impact of inflation, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This offer still gives you a significant amount while acknowledging the diminishing value of money with each round. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. My potential gain of $450,000 is now worth 5% less due to inflation
Actual value for me = $450,000 * 0.95 = $427,500

2. If I reject and we go to another round:
- The money will be worth another 5% less for me
- I might be able to negotiate a better split, but the decreasing value might offset any gains
- There's no guarantee Bob will accept my next offer

3. This is a reasonable offer considering:
- It's not too far from my initial proposal
- The inflation penalty makes waiting costly
- Getting $427,500 now is better than risking further devaluation
