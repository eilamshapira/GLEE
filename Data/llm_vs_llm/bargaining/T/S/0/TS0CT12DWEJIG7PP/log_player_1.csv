"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since you're more affected by inflation than I am, I suggest a 55-45 split in my favor. This is actually fair because if you accept now, your $4500 at 90% value is better than waiting for future rounds with more inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
