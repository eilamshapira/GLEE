"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 60%, you get 40%. We can adjust in future rounds if needed. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. This is round 1, so no inflation has occurred yet
2. Alice's offering me $4000 (40%) and keeping $6000 (60%)
3. If I reject:
   - Next round I can make an offer
   - But my money will be worth 5% less
   - Her money will be worth 10% less
   - This gives me some negotiating leverage
4. 60-40 split in her favor seems a bit unfair for a first offer

Given that I have negotiating leverage due to the different inflation rates, and this first offer is tilted in her favor, I'll reject and make a counter-offer next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a strategic counter-offer:

1. Due to inflation after 1 round:
   - My money is worth 95% of original value
   - Her money is worth 90% of original value
2. This gives me some leverage
3. I'll propose a more balanced split, slightly in my favor

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Since you're more affected by inflation than I am, I suggest a 55-45 split in my favor. This is actually fair because if you accept now, your $4500 at 90% value is better than waiting for future rounds with more inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it down the middle.  Inflation is hurting both of us, and a 50/50 split is the fairest way to ensure we both get a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Current inflation effects:
   - My $5000 would be worth $4,512.50 (9.75% less)
   - Her $5000 would be worth $4,050 (19% less)
2. This is a fair 50-50 split of the nominal amount
3. Due to different inflation rates, I'm actually getting a better real value
4. If I reject:
   - Next round my money will be worth ~15% less
   - Her money will be worth ~29% less
   - But the risk of continued negotiation might not be worth it
5. This is a significant improvement from her first offer (40-60)

Given that:
- It's a fair nominal split
- I'm already benefiting from the inflation differential
- Further delays will hurt both of us
- The offer is reasonable
