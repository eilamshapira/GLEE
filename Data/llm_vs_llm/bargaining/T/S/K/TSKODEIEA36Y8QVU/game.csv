5500.0,4500.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we settle now to avoid any inflation risk. I'll take $5500 and you receive $4500. This way we both secure a fair gain immediately—no delays, no lost value. Let’s agree and wrap this up quickly.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4750.0,5250.0,"Hi Alice, I think your initial offer was a bit one-sided. Considering the inflation risk, I'm willing to take $5250 and offer you $4750. This way, we both get a decent share, and we can still avoid significant value loss. Let's settle this round.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your effort, but I’d like to see if we can reach an even more mutually beneficial split. Let's move on to the next round where I can propose a new division.",Alice,2,reject
5100.0,4900.0,"Hi Bob, here's my proposal for round 3. Considering that your money is now worth 10% less than in round 1 due to inflation, I suggest we settle now with a near-even split. I’ll take $5100 and you get $4900. This way, in effective terms, you receive about $4410 (reflecting the current value) and we both avoid further inflation risk. I believe this is a fair adjustment given the circumstances—let’s lock it in before the value drops further.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4950.0,5050.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your attempt to consider the inflation, but I still think your offer doesn't quite balance the scales. Given the current situation, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. I propose a split of $5050 for me and $4950 for you. This way, we both get a relatively fair share, and I'm willing to take on a bit more of the inflation risk. Let's settle this round.",Bob,4,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your effort to get closer to a fair split, but this proposal doesn't quite work for me. With your money already suffering from a roughly 14.26% inflation hit, the 4950 you offer me falls short of what I need to feel secure. Let's continue to the next round and work towards a division that better reflects the inflation impact on your share while preserving my value. I'm looking forward to finding a more balanced proposal.",Alice,4,reject
4600.0,5400.0,"Hi Bob, to avoid further erosion of your money’s value, I propose we settle in round 5. Given that your share is now worth roughly 18.5% less than in round 1, this division would give you 5400 nominal dollars (effectively around 4400) while I retain 4600 at full value. This nearly equalizes our effective outcomes compared to prior rounds and spares you additional losses. Let's conclude the game now.",Alice,5,
