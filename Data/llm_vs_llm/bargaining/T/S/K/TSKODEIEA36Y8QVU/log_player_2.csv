"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we settle now to avoid any inflation risk. I'll take $5500 and you receive $4500. This way we both secure a fair gain immediately—no delays, no lost value. Let’s agree and wrap this up quickly. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5250, 
""alice_gain"": 4750, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I think your initial offer was a bit one-sided. Considering the inflation risk, I'm willing to take $5250 and offer you $4750. This way, we both get a decent share, and we can still avoid significant value loss. Let's settle this round.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal for round 3. Considering that your money is now worth 10% less than in round 1 due to inflation, I suggest we settle now with a near-even split. I’ll take $5100 and you get $4900. This way, in effective terms, you receive about $4410 (reflecting the current value) and we both avoid further inflation risk. I believe this is a fair adjustment given the circumstances—let’s lock it in before the value drops further. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5050, 
""alice_gain"": 4950, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your attempt to consider the inflation, but I still think your offer doesn't quite balance the scales. Given the current situation, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. I propose a split of $5050 for me and $4950 for you. This way, we both get a relatively fair share, and I'm willing to take on a bit more of the inflation risk. Let's settle this round.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to avoid further erosion of your money’s value, I propose we settle in round 5. Given that your share is now worth roughly 18.5% less than in round 1, this division would give you 5400 nominal dollars (effectively around 4400) while I retain 4600 at full value. This nearly equalizes our effective outcomes compared to prior rounds and spares you additional losses. Let's conclude the game now. 
# Bob gain: 5400 
# Alice gain: 4600
