550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a fair split where I get slightly more to account for my inflation penalty. If we delay too long, we both lose value. Let's try to resolve this quickly to maximize our combined outcome.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Alice, let's go for an even split, which is fair for both of us. This way, neither of us will lose value due to delays. What do you think?",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, I need to account for my 5% inflation penalty per round. I've already lost 10% of my value, while you haven't. A fair split needs to compensate for this asymmetry. This offer helps balance our actual takeaway values - if we delay further, I'll need to ask for more to offset my growing inflation penalty.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
525000.0,475000.0,"Alice, I understand your inflation situation. Let's try to meet halfway with this offer. It acknowledges your inflation and ensures we both come away with a fair share. Let's finalize this!",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
630000.0,370000.0,"Bob, I now face a 19% inflation penalty compared to round 1. This offer compensates for that disadvantage while still being reasonable. If we keep going, I'll need to ask for even more as my inflation increases. Let's finalize this now - this split means we both walk away with roughly equivalent real value.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
540000.0,460000.0,"Alice, considering your inflation loss, I've adjusted my offer. This split gives you a larger share to help balance the impact of inflation on your side. Let's settle on this and close the deal before your inflation penalty increases further.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
670000.0,330000.0,"Bob, my inflation penalty is now over 26%. This means for me to receive the equivalent of $500K from round 1, I need about $675K now. This offer is calibrated to that reality. We're running out of rounds, and my inflation only gets worse. Let's finalize this deal now - any further delays will force me to ask for even more to compensate for increasing inflation.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Alice, I realize your inflation penalty is substantial. My offer recognizes this, giving you a significant share. If we reach a consensus now, we both avoid future complications from further inflation losses on your end.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
715000.0,285000.0,"Bob, my inflation penalty has reached 33.7% - which means I need about $715K now to get the equivalent value of $475K in round 1. We have only 3 rounds left after this, and my position gets worse with each rejection. If we fail to agree by round 12, we both get nothing. This offer is fair considering my substantial inflation penalty. Let's finalize this deal now.",Alice,9,
