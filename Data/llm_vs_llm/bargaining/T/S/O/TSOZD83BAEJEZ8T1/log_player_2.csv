"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer is a 40/60 split in Alice's favor
2. If I reject, the value decreases:
   * For me: 20% less (40$ becomes 32$)
   * For Alice: 5% less (60$ becomes 57$)
3. I could counter-offer, but Alice might reject, leading to further depreciation
4. 40$ is a significant portion, and the risk of getting less through negotiation is high

While I might get more by negotiating, the steep 20% depreciation for me makes this a risky strategy. A guaranteed 40$ is better than potentially getting less or nothing after multiple rounds.
