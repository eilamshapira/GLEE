"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid inflation losses!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I need a bit more to compensate for the inflation I'm experiencing. Let's settle this quickly! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect on me (5% less) and Bob's offer, I'll calculate the effective value:

My gain: 45 * 0.95 = 42.75 (due to 5% inflation)

Since Bob's offer gives me less than half of the original amount, and considering the inflation, I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect on me (5% less in each round), I'll make a new offer. Since two rounds have passed, the money is worth:

* For me: 100 * (0.95)^2 = 100 * 0.9025 = 90.25
* For Bob: 100 * (0.8)^2 = 100 * 0.64 = 64 (since his inflation rate is 20% per round)

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 48,
  ""bob_gain"": 52,
  ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground before inflation eats away more value!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is really hurting me now. I need to secure more, but let's still be fair. 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect on me (14.26% less) and Bob's offer, I'll calculate the effective value:

My gain: 42 * 0.8574 = 36.01 (due to 14.26% inflation, which is (0.95^3) or approximately 0.8574,  1 - 0.1426 = 0.8574)

Since Bob's offer gives me less than half of the original amount, and considering the significant inflation effect on both of us, I'll reject this offer.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect on me (5% less in each round), I'll make a new offer. Since four rounds have passed for me and Bob's last offer, the money is worth:

* For me: 100 * (0.95)^4 = 100 * 0.8145 = 81.45
* For Bob: 100 * (0.8)^4 = 100 * 0.4096 = 40.96 (since his inflation rate is 20% per round)

Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a bigger share to compensate for my relatively lower inflation rate. Let's settle before it's too late!""
}
