"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm proposing a slightly higher split for me because I'm affected by an inflation rate, so my money loses value with each round. Let's split it fairly and avoid dragging this out, as we both lose value over time.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it equally. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage, and we can both walk away with a reasonable amount. Inflation is affecting me too, and round 3 the money will be worth 20% less for me, so let's not drag on. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
