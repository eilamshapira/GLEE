"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm proposing a slightly higher split for me because I'm affected by an inflation rate, so my money loses value with each round. Let's split it fairly and avoid dragging this out, as we both lose value over time. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, your proposal gives you a significant advantage. Let's find a more balanced split. How about we split it 50-50 to ensure fairness for both of us?"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it equally. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage, and we can both walk away with a reasonable amount. Inflation is affecting me too, and round 3 the money will be worth 20% less for me, so let's not drag on.""}"
