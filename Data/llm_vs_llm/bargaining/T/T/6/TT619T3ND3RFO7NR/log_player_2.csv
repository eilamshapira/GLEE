"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair and split it 50/50. What do you say, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair at first glance. However, I need to account for the 20% inflation penalty per round that affects me.

If I accept now, I get $50.
If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, even if I propose getting all $100, the value to me would be $100 Ã— 0.8 = $80 (due to 20% inflation).

Given this inflation effect, the 50/50 split in the current round is actually a reasonable offer. If I reject, I'd need to secure significantly more than 50% in the next round just to break even.
