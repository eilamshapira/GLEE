"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a division that accounts for the 5% depreciation per round that affects my gains. Since this is the first round, I'll make a reasonable offer that Bob is likely to accept to avoid the depreciation of future rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because:
1. It gives me a slight advantage but is still fair enough that Bob might accept
2. If Bob refuses, my future gains will be worth less due to the 5% depreciation
3. It's close enough to 50-50 to be considered reasonable
4. Bob might recognize that getting $450,000 now is better than risking future negotiations"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept, I'll get $450,000 * 0.95 = $427,500 in effective value
2. If I reject, any future gains will be worth another 5% less
3. Bob has increased his demand from my initial proposal
4. There are still 10 rounds left, but each round reduces my effective gains
5. $427,500 is still a substantial amount, and fighting for more might result in worse outcomes due to inflation

Despite the reduction, I'll accept this offer because the inflation penalty makes waiting more rounds increasingly costly for me.
