"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to think about this carefully. Alice is offering me $450,000 while she takes $550,000. Since there's 5% inflation for Alice each round but 0% for me, I have an advantage in later rounds. If I reject now, I can make a counter-offer in round 2.

Let me consider: If Alice rejects my next offer, we'll be in round 3 with her money worth about 10% less. This gives me some negotiating leverage.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a counterproposal that considers our different inflation rates. Since Alice faces 5% inflation per round and I don't, I should propose a division that's more favorable to me while still being reasonable enough for Alice to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing that I receive $550,000 and Alice receives $450,000. This is essentially flipping Alice's original offer. Since Alice faces inflation, she should be motivated to reach an agreement sooner rather than later, as her share loses value with each round."
