"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Alice's offer, I'll get 45, but its value is reduced by 19% due to inflation. So, the actual value I'll get is 45 * 0.81 = 36.45.

Given this, I think I can try to get a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, the total value of the money is reduced. Since I don't know the exact inflation rate for Alice, I'll focus on maximizing my own gain.

The money is worth 19% less for me, and this is the second round of inflation for me (10% in round 2 and another 10% in round 3, but it was applied in round 4, 10% + 10% - (10% * 10%) = 19%). In the next round, it will be worth 10% less again for me (29% total).

I'll make an offer that gives me a bit more than half, taking into account the reduced value.

{""bob_gain"": 57.5, ""alice_gain"": 42.5}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Alice's offer, I'll get 50, but its value is reduced by 34.39% due to inflation. So, the actual value I'll get is 50 * 0.6561 = 32.805.

Given that the money is now worth almost the same for both of us (50), and considering the significant reduction in value for Alice, I think this is a relatively fair offer.
