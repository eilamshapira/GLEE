"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly considering the risk of inflation. This offer gives you a substantial amount while ensuring we both get a good deal early on. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer sounds somewhat reasonable, it heavily favors her. It's only the first round, and I have some leverage to push for a better deal. I'm willing to risk a few rounds of inflation to try and secure a larger portion of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to accept a slightly smaller share than a perfect split to avoid lengthy negotiations. Let's close this deal and both benefit.""} 

**Reasoning:** I'm offering Alice a slightly better deal than she initially proposed, acknowledging the risk of inflation. This offer is still advantageous to me while showing a willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given the inflation, it's better to settle quickly. This offer is fair and ensures we both get a good deal before the money loses more value. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice is trying to use the inflation against me, but her offer is now worse than what I proposed last round! It's clear she's aiming to secure a larger share, but I'm not willing to accept a deal where I get less than what I could have had in the previous round.  I need to stand my ground, but I also need to be mindful that the value is decreasing with each round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is a fair split, Alice. Let's end this before inflation eats away at our potential gains any further.""}

**Reasoning:** I'm proposing a 50/50 split now. It's clear Alice is playing hardball, and the inflation is starting to become a significant factor.  While I'd prefer a larger share, a 50/50 split is fair and ensures we both walk away with a reasonable amount given the circumstances."
