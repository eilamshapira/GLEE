"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, given our different inflation rates, this is actually advantageous for you. If you reject, the total will be worth much less to you in the next round (only 80% of its current value). This offer gives you $4000 now, which is better than what you could reasonably expect if we continue to another round where your money loses 20% more value. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
