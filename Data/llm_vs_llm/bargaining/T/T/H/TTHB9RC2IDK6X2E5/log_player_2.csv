"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's proposal is for an even split of $5,000 each. Let me think about this strategically:

If I reject, we move to the next round where:
- I get to make the proposal
- The total amount is worth 5% less to me (worth 9,500 to me)
- The total amount is worth 20% less to Alice (worth 8,000 to her)

While an even split might seem fair initially, the asymmetric inflation rates give me an advantage in later rounds. If we move to round 2, Alice would rationally accept an offer that gives her at least what she'd get by rejecting and moving to round 3 (where the money would be worth even less to her).

I believe I can propose a better split for myself in the next round, so I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I need to make a strategic offer that Alice would rationally accept, considering the depreciation rates affecting both of us.

For Alice, if she rejects my offer, we'll move to round 3 where the money is worth 36% less to her (80% of 80%). She would only get value equivalent to $6,400 maximum in round 3. Meanwhile, the money would be worth 9.75% less to me (95% of 95%).

Given these constraints, I should offer her enough to make accepting better than rejecting, while maximizing my share.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, 
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, given our different inflation rates, this is actually advantageous for you. If you reject, the total will be worth much less to you in the next round (only 80% of its current value). This offer gives you $4,000 now, which is better than what you could reasonably expect if we continue to another round where your money loses 20% more value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering the inflation rates, this offer gives you a larger share while still providing me with a reasonable amount. Let's end this on a fair note. 
# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's offer carefully.

Alice is offering me $6,000 and taking $4,000. Due to inflation, my $6,000 is now worth about $5,415 in original value (reduced by 9.75%). For Alice, her $4,000 is worth about $2,560 in original value (reduced by 36%).

If I reject:
- We move to round 4
- I make the next offer
- My money would be worth 14.26% less than original (another 5% reduction)
- Alice's money would be worth 48.8% less than original (another 20% reduction)

Since Alice has offered me 60% of the money, which is a better split than her initial 50-50 offer, and continuing would reduce both our shares' values further, this seems reasonable. Alice has matched what I proposed in round 2, showing we've reached a stable point in negotiations.

Taking the offer now secures me a good portion without risking further devaluation.
