"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5263, ""bob_gain"": 4737, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a split of $10,000 into $5,263 for me and $4,737 for you. This offer reflects the discount factor at playâ€”every round costs us both by 10% in value. Accepting now ensures we both secure a fair share and avoid further loss. What do you say?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the 10% depreciation, I propose we split the remaining $9000 into $5500 for me and $4500 for you. This way, we both get a reasonable amount before the value drops further. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
