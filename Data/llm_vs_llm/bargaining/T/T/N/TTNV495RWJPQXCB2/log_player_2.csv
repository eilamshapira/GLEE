"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a split of $10000 into $5263 for me and $4737 for you. This offer reflects the discount factor at playâ€”every round costs us both by 10% in value. Accepting now ensures we both secure a fair share and avoid further loss. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4737 
# Alice gain: 5263
