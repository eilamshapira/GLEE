6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get your money immediately without any inflation impact.",Alice,1,

5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I think a 50-50 split is the fairest approach since we both have equal roles in this negotiation. This way we both get $5000, which is a substantial amount. I have no inflation pressure, so I'm comfortable continuing negotiations if needed, but I believe an equal split is the most reasonable solution.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, I understand your desire for fairness, but due to the 5% inflation penalty I face each round, I need a slightly higher share to achieve real equality. This 55-45 split would give me $5500 (worth $5225 to me after inflation), while you get $4500 at full value. This creates a more genuinely equal outcome considering the inflation effect.",Alice,3,

5200.0,4800.0,"Alice, I appreciate you moving toward a more balanced split. I understand your concern about inflation affecting you, though I can't verify the exact rate. I'm willing to compromise with a 48-52 split in your favor to account for potential inflation effects. This gives you $5200 and me $4800, which seems fair considering we both need to reach an agreement. We're getting closer to a resolution that works for both of us.",Bob,4,
