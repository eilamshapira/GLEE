"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get your money immediately without any inflation impact.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I think a 50-50 split is the fairest approach since we both have equal roles in this negotiation. This way we both get $5000, which is a substantial amount. I have no inflation pressure, so I'm comfortable continuing negotiations if needed, but I believe an equal split is the most reasonable solution. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The money is worth 5% less to me now, so $5000 is actually worth $4750 to me. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round that takes this inflation effect into account."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire for fairness, but due to the 5% inflation penalty I face each round, I need a slightly higher share to achieve real equality. This 55-45 split would give me $5500 (worth $5225 to me after inflation), while you get $4500 at full value. This creates a more genuinely equal outcome considering the inflation effect.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving toward a more balanced split. I understand your concern about inflation affecting you, though I can't verify the exact rate. I'm willing to compromise with a 48-52 split in your favor to account for potential inflation effects. This gives you $5200 and me $4800, which seems fair considering we both need to reach an agreement. We're getting closer to a resolution that works for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. With the current 14.26% inflation, my $5200 is worth about $4458 to me. While I could try to negotiate for more, the increasing inflation rate means further delays will reduce my real gains, and Bob seems firm on keeping close to a 50-50 split. This is a reasonable compromise that gives us both a substantial amount."
