"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get your money immediately without any inflation impact. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing a 60-40 split in her favor, giving me $4,000 while she takes $6,000.

Since there's no inflation for me (0% inflation), there's no cost to continuing negotiations. We have 12 rounds total, so there's plenty of opportunity to make counteroffers. While $4,000 is substantial, a 50-50 split would be more equitable since we both have equal decision rights in this game.

I'll reject this first offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split that's closer to equal while acknowledging Alice's opening position.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I think a 50-50 split is the fairest approach since we both have equal roles in this negotiation. This way we both get $5,000, which is a substantial amount. I have no inflation pressure, so I'm comfortable continuing negotiations if needed, but I believe an equal split is the most reasonable solution.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for fairness, but due to the 5% inflation penalty I face each round, I need a slightly higher share to achieve real equality. This 55-45 split would give me $5500 (worth $5225 to me after inflation), while you get $4500 at full value. This creates a more genuinely equal outcome considering the inflation effect. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to analyze Alice's new offer. She's claiming she faces a 5% inflation penalty per round, which would mean her money is worth less as we continue negotiating. She's now offering a 55-45 split giving me $4,500 and her $5,500.

She mentions her $5,500 would be worth $5,225 to her after inflation, which is closer to an equal split in terms of ""real value"" if her inflation claim is true.

Alice has reduced her demand from 60% to 55%, which is moving in a positive direction. However, I still believe a 50-50 split would be fairest since I can't verify her inflation claims, and the problem statement only told me about my own inflation (which is 0%).

I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4800, 
""alice_gain"": 5200, 
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving toward a more balanced split. I understand your concern about inflation affecting you, though I can't verify the exact rate. I'm willing to compromise with a 48-52 split in your favor to account for potential inflation effects. This gives you $5,200 and me $4,800, which seems fair considering we both need to reach an agreement. We're getting closer to a resolution that works for both of us.""}"
