"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you wanted to take advantage of being first, but a 60-40 split was too uneven. I'm proposing a more balanced 52-48 split that's fair to both of us. Let's not waste time and risk inflation eating into our gains. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

How about we go for a 55-45 split? This way, both of us walk away with a fair share without haggling too much and losing more to inflation. Let me know your thoughts.""}"
