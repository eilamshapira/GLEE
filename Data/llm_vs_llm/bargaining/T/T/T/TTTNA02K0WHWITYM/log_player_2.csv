"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, let's split the money with $6000 for me and $4000 for you. I think this is a fair offer since I'm starting the proposal. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $4000 out of $10000 (40%)
2. If I reject, we move to next round where:
   * I can make a counter-proposal
   * But my money will be worth 5% less ($9500 total value for me)
3. A 60-40 split in the first round favors Alice quite heavily
4. I can likely get a better deal by making a counter-proposal

Given that I can propose next and the 5% inflation isn't too punishing for one round, I'll reject this offer to negotiate for a more equitable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split, considering that we both need to be satisfied to reach an agreement:

{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you wanted to take advantage of being first, but a 60-40 split was too uneven. I'm proposing a more balanced 52-48 split that's fair to both of us. Let's not waste time and risk inflation eating into our gains.""}

Reasoning:
1. My offer is more balanced than Alice's initial 60-40 split
2. I'm still giving myself a slight advantage (52%) since I'm making the offer
3. The proposal is reasonable enough that Alice should seriously consider accepting it
4. My message emphasizes fairness and reminds about the inflation risk to encourage acceptance"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Alright, Bob, I understand where you're coming from. How about we go for a 55-45 split? This way, both of us walk away with a fair share without haggling too much and losing more to inflation. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is offering me $4500, but due to 9.75% inflation, it's actually worth $4061.25 to me
2. This is slightly better than her first offer in real terms
3. If I reject:
   * Next round I can propose again
   * But inflation will increase to 14.75% for me
   * $10,000 will be worth only $8525 to me next round
4. Alice's offer has moved from 60-40 to 55-45, showing willingness to negotiate
5. The inflation penalty is becoming significant
6. We've already used 3 rounds out of 12

Given that:
- The offer has improved
- Inflation is eating into my gains significantly
- Further negotiation might lead to diminishing returns
- Alice has shown reasonable movement towards compromise

I'll accept this offer.
