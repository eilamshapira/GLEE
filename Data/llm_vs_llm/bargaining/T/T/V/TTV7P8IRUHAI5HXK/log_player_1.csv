"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split, but slightly in my favor since Bob faces inflation pressure.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable split that gives Bob a good incentive to accept now rather than wait for future rounds where his money will be worth less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While I could try to negotiate for more, this is actually a better split for me than what I proposed initially ($60 vs $55). Since Bob is already facing a 5% inflation penalty on his share, and there's a risk of getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds, it's rational to accept this favorable offer."
