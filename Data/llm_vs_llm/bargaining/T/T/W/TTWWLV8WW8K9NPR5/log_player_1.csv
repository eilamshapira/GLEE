"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a proposal to divide the $10,000.

Given the 20% inflation with each round, it's in my interest to reach an agreement soon. However, I also want to secure a fair portion for myself. I'll propose a division that gives both of us a substantial amount, but slightly favors me since I have the first-mover advantage.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I believe this is a fair distribution that should be acceptable to Bob, considering that if we move to another round, the total value decreases for me due to inflation."
