"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

1. Current offer: I get $4000, Alice gets $6000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 10% inflation, any amount I get next round will be worth 10% less
4. If I reject, my $4000 would effectively become worth $3600 next round

The current split (40/60) isn't great, but considering the inflation penalty, rejecting might put me in a worse position. If I make a counter-offer next round, Alice might reject it, leading to further rounds and more value loss.
