"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, the money is now worth 20% less to me, so the total amount I consider is $10,000 * 0.8 = $8,000. 

To make a fair offer, I'll split it 50/50.
{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 64% of its original value to me (100% - 36% = 64%). 

Alice's offer of $4500 is equivalent to $4500 * 0.64 = $2880 in the original value. 

I'll reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer again, the money is now worth even less to me due to inflation. 

In round 1, it was 100%. 
In round 2, it was 80%. 
In round 3, it was 64%. 
Now, in round 4, it's 64% * 0.8 = 51.2%. 

To make a fair offer, I'll consider the original $10,000, but keep in mind that its value to me has decreased. 

I'll offer a split that's slightly in Alice's favor, hoping she'll accept.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 40.96% of its original value to me (100% - 59.04% = 40.96%). 

Alice's offer of $5000 is equivalent to $5000 * 0.4096 = $2048 in the original value. 

This offer seems more reasonable, and since the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, I'll accept this offer to avoid further losses.
