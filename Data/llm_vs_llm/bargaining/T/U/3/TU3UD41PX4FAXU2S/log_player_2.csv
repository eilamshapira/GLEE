"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a split where I get $55 and you get $45. This is fair considering you face higher inflation (20% per round) than I do (5% per round), so you have more incentive to agree quickly. Let's settle this now and both walk away with good value. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. While it's true I have a higher inflation rate (20% vs Alice's 5%), I'm not sure a $45/$55 split is optimal for me.

If I reject now, I can make a counteroffer next round. However, my $45 would only be worth $36 after one round of 20% inflation. Alice's $55 would be worth $52.25 after 5% inflation.

Given the steep inflation penalty I face and the fact that I'll still get a substantial amount, accepting now seems prudent rather than risking greater losses through negotiation.
