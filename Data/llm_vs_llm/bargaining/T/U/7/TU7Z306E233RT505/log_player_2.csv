"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $45 and she gets $55 out of the $100. 

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round. However, I should account for the inflation effect - for me, the money maintains its value (0% devaluation), but for Alice, it loses 10% of its value each round.

In the next round, the $100 would still be worth $100 to me, but only $90 to Alice. This gives me some leverage in negotiation.

I think I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a counter-offer that takes into account the inflation that Alice experiences.

Since Alice faces 10% inflation per round, the money is now worth only 90% of its original value to her. This means I can propose a deal that gives me a bit more while still being attractive to Alice compared to waiting further rounds.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'm offering Alice $45, which is worth more to her now than waiting for future rounds where inflation will reduce the value further. This is a fair division considering the asymmetric inflation rates."
