4000.0,6000.0,"Hi Bob, to avoid the steep 20% inflation hit that I face if we delay, I suggest a quick resolution. I’m offering you $6000, while I accept $4000. This way we both get a fair share immediately. What do you think?",Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your eagerness to settle quickly. However, I think a 60-40 split in your favor doesn't account for my own needs. I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle with a 55-45 split. This way, we both benefit from the immediate resolution.",Bob,2,

0.0,10000.0,"Hi Bob, considering that each round of delay further reduces the value I receive while your share remains intact, I realize that if we continue, you'll be in a stronger position. To avoid more inflation on my end and to settle immediately, I’m offering you the entire $10000 and taking nothing. I hope we can agree to finalize this now.",Alice,3,
