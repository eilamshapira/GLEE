"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, to avoid the steep 20% inflation hit that I face if we delay, I suggest a quick resolution. I’m offering you $6,000, while I accept $4,000. This way we both get a fair share immediately. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your eagerness to settle quickly. However, I think a 60-40 split in your favor doesn't account for my own needs. I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle with a 55-45 split. This way, we both benefit from the immediate resolution. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 0, ""bob_gain"": 10000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, considering that each round of delay further reduces the value I receive while your share remains intact, I realize that if we continue, you'll be in a stronger position. To avoid more inflation on my end and to settle immediately, I’m offering you the entire $10,000 and taking nothing. I hope we can agree to finalize this now.""}"
