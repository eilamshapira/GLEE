"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to avoid the steep 20% inflation hit that I face if we delay, I suggest a quick resolution. I’m offering you $6000, while I accept $4000. This way we both get a fair share immediately. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your eagerness to settle quickly. However, I think a 60-40 split in your favor doesn't account for my own needs. I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle with a 55-45 split. This way, we both benefit from the immediate resolution.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, considering that each round of delay further reduces the value I receive while your share remains intact, I realize that if we continue, you'll be in a stronger position. To avoid more inflation on my end and to settle immediately, I’m offering you the entire $10000 and taking nothing. I hope we can agree to finalize this now. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 0
