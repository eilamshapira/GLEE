"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""I propose a 70-30 split in my favor. Consider that with each round, the money will be worth 5% less to you due to inflation, so this is a fair offer that you should accept now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a fair 55-45 split in my favor. This is much more balanced than your previous offer, and it gives you a substantial $450000. If you reject, we'll both risk losing value in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. If I accept:
   * I get $450,000 (full value)
   * Bob gets $550,000 (worth 5% less to him = $522,500 in round 1 value)

2. If I reject:
   * I can make a new offer next round
   * But Bob will face another 5% inflation penalty
   * However, Bob might reject again, leading to further rounds

The current offer is significantly better than my initial proposal would have been for Bob. While I could try to negotiate for more, there's a risk of losing value in subsequent rounds if we can't reach an agreement.
