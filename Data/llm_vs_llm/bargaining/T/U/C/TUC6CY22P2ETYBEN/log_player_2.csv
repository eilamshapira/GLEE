"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 70-30 split in my favor. Consider that with each round, the money will be worth 5% less to you due to inflation, so this is a fair offer that you should accept now. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With a 70-30 split, I would get $300,000.
If I reject and we go to the next round:
- The total value would be worth 5% less to me
- So my maximum potential gain would be $950,000 (95% of $1M)

Even if I could get a much better split in the next round, the 5% reduction is significant. However, a 70-30 split seems too unfavorable given I can still make a counter-offer.

If I reject, the money will be worth $950,000 to me in the next round, and I can propose a more balanced split.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a strategic offer...

The money is now worth 950,000$ to me due to the 5% inflation penalty from the first round. I should propose a more balanced split that Alice would find acceptable to avoid further rounds and inflation penalties.
