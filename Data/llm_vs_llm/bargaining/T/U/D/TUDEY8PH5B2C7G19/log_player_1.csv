"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation impact, I propose 55/45 in my favor to balance out the value loss. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $4500 I'd gain is actually worth $4500 * 0.8 = $3600 to me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Due to inflation, the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, and another 20% less than in the second round, so it's worth 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 of the original value. The money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round, and another 10% less than in the second round, so it's worth 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 of the original value.

To make a fair offer, I'll consider these values. 

{""alice_gain"": 5200, 
""bob_gain"": 4800, 
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, considering the inflation impact""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is hitting us hard, especially me. Let's settle on 60/40 to make up for the value loss and end this game. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $4000 I'd gain is actually worth $4000 * (1 - 0.488) = $4000 * 0.512 = $2048 to me.
