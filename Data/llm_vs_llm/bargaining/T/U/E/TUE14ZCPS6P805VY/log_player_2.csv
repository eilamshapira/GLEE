"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. 

Alice is offering me $4,000 out of the $10,000 pot, keeping $6,000 for herself. This is a 40-60 split.

If I reject and proceed to the next round:
- The money will be worth 20% less to me
- The money will be worth 5% less to Alice
- I'll get to make the next proposal

With 20% inflation, if I make a proposal next round, even if I ask for the full $10,000, it would only be worth $8,000 to me. And Alice would likely reject such an extreme offer anyway.

The current offer of $4,000 is better than what I'm likely to get after inflation in subsequent rounds, even though it's not a 50-50 split.
