"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make my first offer to Bob, considering the inflation rates for both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a fair split that accounts for our different inflation rates. If we delay too long, we both lose value - yours drops faster (20% per round) compared to mine (5%). This is a reasonable offer that maximizes our combined value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's keep it simple and go for an even split. This way, we avoid the penalty from future rounds, and both of us get the maximum value without loss. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
