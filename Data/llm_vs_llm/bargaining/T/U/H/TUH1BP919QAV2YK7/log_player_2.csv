"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering a fair split that accounts for our different inflation rates. If we delay too long, we both lose value - yours drops faster (20% per round) compared to mine (5%). This is a reasonable offer that maximizes our combined value. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, let's keep it simple and go for an even split. This way, we avoid the penalty from future rounds, and both of us get the maximum value without loss. What do you think?""}"
