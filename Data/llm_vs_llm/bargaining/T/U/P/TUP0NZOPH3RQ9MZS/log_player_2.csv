"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I receive $400,000 while she takes $600,000 of the $1,000,000. While this isn't an even split, it's still a substantial amount. Given that there's no inflation for me between rounds, I don't lose value by rejecting and making a counter-offer in the next round. However, I don't know how inflation affects Alice, which could potentially give me more leverage in later rounds.

I think I'll reject this offer and propose a more favorable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more balanced counter-offer while providing a brief explanation.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose an equal 50-50 split which is fair to both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice has rejected my fair 50-50 split and has now offered me an even worse deal than in round 1 ($350,000 instead of $400,000). Interestingly, I've learned that Alice faces inflation of 9.75% compared to round 1, which means her money is losing value with each passing round.

Given this information, I can use this inflation pressure to my advantage in negotiations. If I reject this offer, Alice will face even more inflation in future rounds, which strengthens my position.

I'll reject this offer and make a more strategic counter-proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Now that I understand Alice faces inflation pressure (her money is worth 9.75% less already), I'll make a strategic offer that acknowledges this reality while improving my position.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I propose this division considering the inflation you're facing. A quick agreement benefits you more than further delays, and this is still a substantial amount for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice's inflation has increased to 18.55% since round 1, yet she's still only offering me $380,000 (which is better than her last offer but worse than her initial offer). This suggests she's feeling the pressure of inflation but is still trying to maintain a significant advantage in the split.

Since my money doesn't lose value with inflation, I have a strong negotiating position. Alice's money continues to lose value with each round, which should push her toward accepting a more favorable deal for me in future rounds.

I'll reject this offer and continue negotiations.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that Alice's inflation has increased to 18.55% and she's starting to make slightly better offers, I'll adjust my proposal to be more attractive to her while still improving my position compared to her last offer.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I propose this division considering your increasing inflation rate (now at 18.55%). With each round, your share becomes less valuable to you, while mine maintains its value. This offer gives you a significant amount now before further inflation erodes its worth."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Alice's inflation has now increased to 26.49% since round 1, and she's offering me $400,000 - the same as her initial offer. While this isn't an improvement over her first proposal, I need to consider several factors:

1. Alice's money continues to lose value (now worth over 26% less)
2. She seems resistant to giving me more than $400,000
3. We could potentially continue this back-and-forth for several more rounds

While I could reject and push for more, there's a risk of extended negotiations where we both potentially lose value. Given that I'm still getting 40% of the total amount with no inflation penalty, this might be a reasonable point to accept.

However, since I know her position is weakening with inflation and my position remains strong, I'll make one more attempt at a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice's inflation is now at 26.49% and increasing with each round, I'll make a more moderate proposal that might be more acceptable to her while still improving my position:

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split given your significant inflation (26.49% and rising). This offer gives you $450,000 now, which is more valuable than a larger amount after more rounds of inflation. I believe this is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our positions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice significant progress in this negotiation. Alice is now offering me $450,000, which is her best offer yet. Her inflation has increased to 33.66%, meaning her share of the money continues to rapidly lose value while mine retains its full value.

This offer gives me 45% of the total amount, which is much closer to an even split than her previous offers. Given that:

1. Alice has finally increased her offer substantially
2. Her inflation is now over a third of her original value
3. We've been negotiating for multiple rounds already
4. This represents a reasonable compromise

I think this is a good point to accept and conclude our negotiation.
