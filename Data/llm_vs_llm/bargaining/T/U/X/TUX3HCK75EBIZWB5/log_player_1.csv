Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, considering inflation, my gains are worth less. I need to make a decision.

Given the offer:

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 3, keeping in mind the inflation that is affecting my share:

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 425000 
# Bob gain: 575000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's calculate the adjusted value of my share.

In round 1, I was offered \$600,000. Now, in round 4, the money is worth 14.26% less.  This means that \$1 in round 4 is worth $1 / 1.1426 = $0.8752 in round 1 terms.  Alternatively, the money is worth 1 - 0.1426 = 85.74% of its original value.

The offer is:

*   Alice gain: $425,000

Because the money is worth less now, I will **reject** the offer.
```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
