"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer to divide the $1,000,000.

Given that we face different inflation rates (10% for me, 20% for Bob), I should consider a fair split that accounts for these differing time preferences.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering that if we go to another round, the total value decreases more significantly for Bob than for me, giving me slightly more leverage. However, I'm still offering Bob a substantial portion to encourage acceptance now rather than continuing to negotiate with diminishing returns for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer taking into account our advancing rounds and the differential inflation impact.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

Given that we're now in round 3, I'm adjusting my offer to reach a more balanced agreement. I'm offering Bob a slightly higher amount than my previous offer while still maintaining an advantage for myself. The inflation is affecting Bob more severely (20% per round versus my 10%), so reaching an agreement sooner is more beneficial for him. This 55-45 split represents a fair compromise that acknowledges both our positions while trying to avoid further devaluation of our potential gains."
