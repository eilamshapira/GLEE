Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the inflation affected only my valuation, how about we split it evenly? This way, we both get an equal share, and it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
