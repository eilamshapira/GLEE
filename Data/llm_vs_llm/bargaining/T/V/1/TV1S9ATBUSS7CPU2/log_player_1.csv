"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair initial offer to Bob, taking into account the inflation aspect.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

My offer gives Bob a substantial portion ($450,000) while acknowledging that I face no inflation penalty while he faces a 10% penalty per round. This is a reasonable starting point that should be attractive enough for Bob to consider accepting rather than moving to the next round where his money would be worth less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more strategic offer considering the inflation dynamics.

{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000}

I'm adjusting my offer to account for the fact that each round, Bob faces a 10% inflation penalty. If we were to go another round, the value of Bob's money would decrease further. This offer gives Bob a substantial $420,000 while recognizing the time pressure he faces due to inflation. This is a fair division that acknowledges our different inflation situations."
