"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. 

Alice is offering me $450,000 out of the $1,000,000 total. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but the money will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation (so effectively we'd be dividing $900,000 from my perspective).

If I accept now, I get $450,000.
If I reject and make a counter-offer, I'd need to get more than $500,000 in the next round to make up for the 10% inflation penalty.

Since I can make my own offer next round if I reject, and Alice has no inflation penalty, I'll reject this offer to propose a more favorable split.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a strategic offer that considers both my inflation penalty and what would be acceptable to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split of the money. This gives me $500,000 which is better than the $450,000 Alice offered in round 1. Even with the 10% inflation penalty I face, this is a reasonable offer that should be acceptable to Alice, as it's actually more generous to her than what pure game theory would suggest is optimal for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer carefully, considering the inflation penalty I now face.

In round 1, Alice offered me $450,000.
Now in round 3, Alice is offering me $420,000, which is less than her initial offer.

Due to the 19% inflation penalty I now face, if I reject this offer and we move to round 4:
- I'll face an even larger inflation penalty (likely 27%)
- The effective value of any money I receive will decrease further

If I accept now, I get $420,000 which is worth $420,000 * 0.81 = $340,200 in round 1 terms.
If I reject, I'll need to secure a significantly higher amount in my next proposal to overcome the increasing inflation penalty, and Alice seems to be reducing her offers over time.

Given the deteriorating conditions due to inflation and Alice's decreasing offers, I'll accept this offer.
