"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a 60/40 split given that I'm making the first offer, and we can both walk away with a nice sum. Letâ€™s keep it simple and wrap things up in the first round. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:

1. She's offering me $400,000 of the $1,000,000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, the total amount will decrease by 5% (to $950,000) if we go to the next round
4. My maximum potential in the next round would be proposing to take most of $950,000
5. But Alice could reject that, leading to further devaluation

While 40% might seem low, considering:
- It's still a substantial amount ($400,000)
- The risk of losing value through inflation
- The uncertainty of reaching an agreement in later rounds
- First-mover advantage is worth something

This is a reasonable offer that gives me significant value without risk.
