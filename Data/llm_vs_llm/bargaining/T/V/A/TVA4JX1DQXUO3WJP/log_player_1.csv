"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing an even split of $100 right off the bat. Let's lock in our gains now and avoid any inflation losses on my side. I believe this fair division benefits both of us. What do you say?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your proposal, but I believe I can offer you a little less while still ensuring a fair split. Iâ€™m offering you $45 for your share. Let's maximize what we can get before inflation hits us! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Bob, I believe I'll accept your offer of $45 for me and $55 for you in this round. With the inflation factor on my side, it's better for me to secure a guaranteed share now rather than risk further devaluation in future rounds. Let's agree and close the deal!""}"
