"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given Alice's offer, I need to carefully consider the consequences of accepting or rejecting it.

If I accept, I get $400,000 and Alice gets $600,000.

If I reject, I can make my own offer in Round 2. However, I should consider the inflation factor - while my value stays the same, Alice's money loses 10% value each round. This gives me some leverage in negotiations as we progress.

Since this is just the first round and I have the opportunity to propose a better split for myself in the next round, I'll reject this offer. I believe I can secure a more favorable division.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more favorable to me while still being reasonable for Alice, considering the inflation factor that affects her.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering a split where I receive $550,000 and Alice receives $450,000. This is more balanced than her initial offer and acknowledges that with each passing round, the money will be worth less to her due to the 10% inflation rate on her side. This should be an attractive offer for her to accept since delaying further would decrease the value of her share."
