"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split that accounts for the higher inflation penalty I face. Since I lose 10% value per round compared to Bob's 5%, I should aim for a reasonable first offer that Bob would likely accept.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split because it's close enough to an even division while giving me a slight advantage as the first mover. It's fair enough that Bob should seriously consider accepting it rather than moving to the next round where both of us would lose value due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. In this round, due to inflation:
- My $4800 is actually worth $4320 (10% less)
- Bob's $5200 is worth $4940 (5% less)

2. If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 3:
- Values will decrease further (20% for me, 10% for Bob)
- Any amount I propose would be worth significantly less
- Bob might reject again, leading to even more value loss

3. While this offer gives Bob a bit more than me, the inflation penalty makes waiting costly, especially for me since I face higher inflation.

Given these factors, accepting this offer now is better than risking further devaluation in future rounds.
