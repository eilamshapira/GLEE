"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. This gives us a good split, with a slight advantage for me since the money loses value faster for you. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice offers me $4000 and keeps $6000
2. If I reject, in the next round the money is worth 20% less to me (only 5% less to Alice)
3. While the split isn't equal, accepting now guarantees me $4000
4. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer, but Alice might reject it, and we'd both lose value
5. The difference in inflation rates puts me at a disadvantage in later rounds

While I could try to negotiate for a more equal split, the significant inflation rate difference makes immediate action more valuable for me. The offer, while not perfectly equal, is reasonable considering these constraints.
