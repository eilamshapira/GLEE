"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer for the first round. I want to make a fair proposal that considers the 5% inflation penalty per round for me.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose an even 50-50 split of the $10,000. This gives us each $5,000, which seems fair to start with. If we agree now, we can both walk away with a substantial amount without risking inflation penalties in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Bob's offer considering the 5% inflation penalty I face.

If I accept Bob's offer now, I'll get $4,000, but it's worth 5% less than in round 1, so effectively $3,800 in round 1 value.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 3, we'll face another 5% inflation for my portion. Given that Bob knows about my inflation penalty, I should carefully consider whether waiting will lead to a better outcome.

Since Bob's current offer gives me a significant portion ($4,000), and the inflation penalty will continue to reduce my effective gains in future rounds, I'll accept this offer rather than risk further depreciation of my share.
