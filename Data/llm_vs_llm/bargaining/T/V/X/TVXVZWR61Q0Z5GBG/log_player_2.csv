"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer of an equal split of the $10,000.

Since there's no inflation for me (0% mentioned in the rules), there's no financial penalty for continuing to future rounds. However, there is the risk of reaching round 12 without agreement, where we both get nothing.

A 50-50 split is fair, but since I have the chance to make a counter-offer without penalty, I should try to secure a better deal for myself.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a slightly better offer for myself while still being reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer that still gives Alice a substantial amount while giving me a slightly better deal than the initial 50-50 split."
