"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000 out of the $10,000.

I should consider the inflation penalty if I reject. If I reject and we go to round 2, the money will be worth 20% less to me, meaning the $10,000 pot would effectively be worth only $8,000 to me. If I make a counteroffer, I'd need to propose a split that gives me more than $4,000 after accounting for this inflation.

Since this is the first round, and further delays would significantly reduce the value for both of us (especially for me with the higher inflation rate), I'll reject but aim to make a fair counteroffer in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a counteroffer that considers the inflation penalties we both face. Since I'm facing a higher inflation rate (20% vs Alice's 10%), it's in my best interest to settle quickly.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an even 50-50 split of the money. This is a fair division that gives us both $5,000. If Alice rejects this offer, she'll face a 10% inflation penalty, meaning the total will be worth less to her in the next round. Given that we both face inflation penalties, a fair split now is better than continuing to negotiate while the value decreases for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's new offer of $4,500 for me and $5,500 for her, considering the current inflation penalties.

Due to inflation, my $4,500 is actually worth only $2,880 in original value (64% of $4,500), while Alice's $5,500 is worth $4,455 in original value (81% of $5,500).

If I reject and we go to round 4, I'll face even more severe inflation (likely around 49% less from original value), making any future amount substantially less valuable to me.

Alice has increased her offer from $4,000 to $4,500, which shows some movement toward compromise. Given the significant inflation penalty I'm facing and the diminishing returns of further negotiation, accepting now is better than continuing to lose value.
