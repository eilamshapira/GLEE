600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we split the million dollars with me taking $600000 and you taking $400000. This way, we both get a significant amount, and I think it's a fair start. What do you say?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I counter with a more balanced offer. I propose I get $550000 and you get $450000. This is closer to an even split and more equitable.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
525000.0,475000.0,"Bob, since we're trying to find a middle ground, I'm proposing $525000 for me and $475000 for you. This is closer to your last offer but still gives us both a good share. Let's see if we can settle this round.",Alice,3,

490000.0,510000.0,"Alice, let's get this done. I propose $510000 for me and $490000 for you. A slightly better deal for me, but still very close, and hopefully enough for us to agree.",Bob,4,
