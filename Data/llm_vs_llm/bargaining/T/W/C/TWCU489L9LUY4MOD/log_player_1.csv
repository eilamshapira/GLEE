"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concern about inflation, but it affects me too - by 5% each round. I'm proposing a more balanced 55-45 split in my favor. This gives you a significant portion while recognizing that delaying costs me value. Let's try to reach an agreement quickly to maximize value for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
