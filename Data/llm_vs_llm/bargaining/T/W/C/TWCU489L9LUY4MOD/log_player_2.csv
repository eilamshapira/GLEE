"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40 in my favor to account for inflation. This is a fair start considering the decreasing value of the money for me. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice wants 60% ($600,000) and is offering me 40% ($400,000).

While I'm affected by 5% inflation per round, I don't know how inflation affects Alice. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but the total will be worth 5% less to me.

Since this is just the first round and I have the opportunity to make a counter-offer next, I'll reject this initial proposal to try for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counter-offer that acknowledges inflation while seeking a more balanced split.

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I understand your concern about inflation, but it affects me too - by 5% each round. I'm proposing a more balanced 55-45 split in my favor. This gives you a significant portion while recognizing that delaying costs me value. Let's try to reach an agreement quickly to maximize value for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns about inflation affecting you as well. Let's meet in the middle with a 55-45 split in my favor. This way, we both get a fair share considering the decreasing value of the money. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this new information carefully. I now know that Alice is affected by inflation at 9.5% per round (since her money is worth 19% less after 2 rounds), which is a higher inflation rate than mine at 5% per round.

Alice is now offering me 45% ($450,000) and taking 55% ($550,000). Since I know she faces higher inflation than I do, and we're already at round 3 where my share is worth 9.75% less than it would have been in round 1, accepting now makes more sense than continuing to negotiate.

Given our different inflation rates and the progress of rounds, this seems like a reasonable compromise.
