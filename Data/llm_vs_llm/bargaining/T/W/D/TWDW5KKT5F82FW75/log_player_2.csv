"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair on the surface. However, I need to account for the inflation effect.

If I reject this offer, I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, but the money will be worth 20% less to me. That means the full $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $800,000 to me in the next round. Even if I were to get all of it (which Alice would likely reject), I'd still be getting less value than the $500,000 offered now.

Given the substantial inflation penalty and the fair nature of the initial offer, I'll accept.
