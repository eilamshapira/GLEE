"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer for the first round that's fair, considering the 5% inflation I'll face per round.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose an equal split of the money - $5,000 for each of us. This is a fair division that gives us both equal value, and we can conclude this negotiation immediately without losing value to inflation."
