"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze Alice's offer carefully.

Alice has proposed a 50-50 split of the $10,000, giving each of us $5,000. This is a perfectly fair and equal division. I don't face any inflation penalty, so the value of the money stays the same for me regardless of which round we settle in.

Since this is a fair offer right from the first round, and there's no advantage for me to reject it and make a counter-offer (as the total sum remains the same), I'll accept this proposal.
