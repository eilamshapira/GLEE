"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let me propose a fair split while accounting for potential future inflation if negotiations drag on.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose this split because it gives me a slight advantage while still being reasonable enough that Bob might accept it. If he declines, the 5% inflation penalty would start affecting future rounds, making it beneficial for both of us to reach an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Due to 5% inflation, if I accept this $50 offer now, it's actually worth $47.50 to me
2. If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount I get will be worth another 5% less
3. Bob seems to be taking a fair approach with a 50-50 split
4. There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in future rounds, and the value will keep decreasing

Given these factors, I'll accept this offer. While it's less than my initial proposal, the inflation penalty makes it risky to continue negotiating, and this is still a fair split.
