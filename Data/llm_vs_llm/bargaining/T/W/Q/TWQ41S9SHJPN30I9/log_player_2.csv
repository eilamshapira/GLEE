"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The current offer is $400,000 for me and $600,000 for Alice
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but:
   - The money will be worth 10% less to me
   - The $400,000 now would be equivalent to $444,444 in next round
   - This gives me some negotiating room

Since this is just the first round and the offer gives Alice a significantly larger share (60%), I think I can do better by making a counter-offer, even accounting for the 10% inflation penalty.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer, but need to account for the 10% inflation penalty I'm facing:

Since money is worth 10% less to me now, I need to ask for more to make up for it. A 50-50 split would have been $500,000 each, but due to inflation, I need approximately $555,556 to get the equivalent value of $500,000 from round 1.

I'll propose a split that's more balanced than Alice's initial offer while accounting for my inflation penalty:

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

This gives me a bit more to compensate for the inflation I'm experiencing, while still offering Alice a substantial amount that's not too far from an equal split from her perspective."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Current offer: $420,000 for me
2. Due to 19% inflation, this $420,000 is equivalent to about $340,200 in round 1 value
3. Alice's offer has improved slightly from her first offer ($400,000 â†’ $420,000)
4. If I reject:
   - Next round will have 27.1% inflation (1.1 * 1.1 * 1.1)
   - I would need an even larger nominal amount to get the same value
   - The risk of further rounds reducing the real value of my gain increases

Given that:
- The inflation is significantly eating into my gains
- Alice has shown limited movement in negotiations
- The risk of further depreciation is high
- We might end up in a worse position if negotiations continue
