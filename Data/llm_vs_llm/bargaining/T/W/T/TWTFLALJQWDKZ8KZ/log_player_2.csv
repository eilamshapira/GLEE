"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000000 
# Alice gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Alice is offering me the entire $1,000,000, leaving nothing for herself. While this might seem like a perfect deal for me, it's so extreme that it feels unrealistic - Alice would likely never agree to walk away with nothing.

Given that:
1. I could make a counter-offer in the next round
2. Alice loses 10% value each round due to inflation
3. We have plenty of rounds remaining
4. A more balanced split might lead to a quicker resolution

I'll reject this offer. I can propose a more reasonable split that would still be very favorable to me but give Alice some incentive to accept.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice loses 10% value each round and we're now in round 2, I should make a strategic offer that accounts for this. I want to offer Alice enough to make it worthwhile for her to accept, considering that any future counter-offers would be worth less to her.

Let me propose a split where I get a significant majority but Alice still gets a meaningful amount:

{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000}

This offer gives me 80% of the money while leaving Alice with $200,000. For Alice, this $200,000 is better than waiting for future rounds where her money would be worth less due to her 10% inflation penalty. It's also a much more reasonable offer than her initial extreme proposal, making it more likely to lead to a successful negotiation."
