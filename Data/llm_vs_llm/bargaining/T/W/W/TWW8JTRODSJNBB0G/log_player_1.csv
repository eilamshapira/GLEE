"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a slightly favorable split for myself while still being fair enough that Bob might accept, considering I don't know how inflation affects him.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

This splits the money 55-45 in my favor. It's a reasonable first offer that gives Bob a substantial amount while securing a good portion for myself. If Bob rejects, the 5% inflation will affect my next potential gains, so I want to make this initial offer attractive enough for consideration."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept, I'll get $5000, but due to 5% inflation, it's effectively worth $4750 to me
- If I reject, we go to round 3 where I can make another offer, but I'll face 10% total inflation on my gains
- Bob's offering an equal split, which is fair, but worth less to me due to inflation
- If I reject, I risk getting an even worse deal in future rounds as inflation accumulates

Given that inflation only affects my gains and not Bob's, and that this is a reasonable offer that gives me a substantial amount even after inflation, I'll accept. Further negotiation might lead to worse outcomes due to compounding inflation.
