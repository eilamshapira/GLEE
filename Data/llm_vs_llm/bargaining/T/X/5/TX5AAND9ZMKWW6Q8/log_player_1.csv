"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $600,000 and giving Bob $400,000, with a message suggesting that this is a fair starting point. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's keep it simple and fair, a 50/50 split. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, the $500,000 I would receive is actually worth $450,000 to me.

Considering this, a 50/50 split doesn't seem as fair to me as it would have in the first round. I think I can do better.

My response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less with each passing round, I need to make a more favorable offer to myself to account for the inflation.

In Round 2, the money was worth 90% of its original value to me. Now, in Round 3, it's worth 90% * 90% = 81% of its original value.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Inflation is eating away at my share, so I need a better deal!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $700,000 and giving Bob $300,000, with a message explaining my reasoning. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand inflation is a factor, so let's compromise. This offer considers both our positions. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 27.1% less due to inflation, the $550,000 I would receive is actually worth $550,000 * (1 - 0.271) = $402,450 to me.

Considering this, Bob's offer seems more reasonable, as it takes into account the inflation factor affecting my share. I think this might be a good compromise.

My response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
