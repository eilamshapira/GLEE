"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is eating away at my share, so I need a better deal! 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Alice's share is being impacted by inflation (unknown to me by how much each round), accepting this offer would give me significantly less than a 50/50 split.  It's worth seeing if I can negotiate a better deal, even with my own value potentially decreasing."
