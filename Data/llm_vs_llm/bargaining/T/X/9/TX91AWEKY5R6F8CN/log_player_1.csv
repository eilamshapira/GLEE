Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

```
Reasoning:

While Bob's offer seems appealing at first glance, it's crucial to consider the impact of inflation and the potential for better offers in future rounds. 

Here's why I reject:

* **Inflation Impact:** My potential gain of $600,000 is worth 5% less than it was in round 1, effectively reducing its value.
* **Future Rounds:**  We are only in round 2. There's a high chance I can secure a better deal in subsequent rounds, especially if Bob is more severely affected by inflation than I am. 

By rejecting, I signal my willingness to negotiate for a fairer share and put pressure on Bob to offer more favorable terms in the next round.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

Reasoning:

This offer is a strategic adjustment from my previous offer:

* Increased Share for Alice: I've increased my share to reflect my stronger bargaining position after Bob's unfavorable offer in Round 2. 
* Still Appealing to Bob: While my share has increased, the offer remains reasonably balanced and attractive to Bob, especially considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation.

This offer aims to secure a favorable agreement while leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 630000 
# Bob gain: 370000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Reasoning:

While this offer is still slightly in Bob's favor before considering inflation, the impact of inflation has become significant enough to sway my decision. 

Here's why:

* Inflation Impact on Bob: Bob's potential gain is now worth almost half its original value. This suggests he might be experiencing a much higher inflation rate, making him more willing to accept a smaller share.
* Time Pressure: With each passing round, the value of the money decreases. We are already in Round 4, leaving less time to reach a mutually agreeable outcome.

While I could potentially negotiate for a slightly larger share in subsequent rounds, the risk of losing the entire amount due to inflation outweighs the potential benefit of a marginally better deal."
