"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer is 4000$ for me and 6000$ for Alice
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 20% less in the next round
3. 4000$ now is better than 4800$ in the next round (because of 20% inflation)
4. There's no guarantee Alice will offer better terms in future rounds
5. This is a reasonable first offer - I get 40% of the total

Given these considerations, I will accept the offer.
