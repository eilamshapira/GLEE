6000.0,4000.0,I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering we both need to agree quickly to avoid losing value to inflation.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"I propose a fair 50-50 split. This way we both get equal shares, and we can conclude quickly before inflation reduces our gains. It's the most equitable solution for both of us.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"I propose a 55-45 split. This accounts for my higher inflation rate of 10% vs your 5%, making it truly fair when considering our different inflation impacts. Let's agree now to minimize our losses.",Alice,3,
