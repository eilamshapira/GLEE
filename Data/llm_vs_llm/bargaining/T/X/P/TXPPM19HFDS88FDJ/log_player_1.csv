Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a fair 50-50 split. This way we both get equal shares, and we can conclude quickly before inflation reduces our gains. It's the most equitable solution for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject because while a 50-50 split might seem fair at first glance, the inflation rates affect us differently. Since my inflation rate (10%) is higher than Bob's (5%), delaying hurts me more than it hurts him. Therefore, I should receive a higher share to compensate for this disadvantage."
