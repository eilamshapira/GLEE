"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering we both need to agree quickly to avoid losing value to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With a 60-40 split, I'd get $4,000. If I reject and propose next round:
- The total value will be worth 5% less to me
- It will be worth 10% less to Alice
- I could propose a better split, but Alice might reject

If Alice rejects my counter-offer, we'd lose another round of value. The inflation pressure is significant.

However, a 60-40 split in Alice's favor seems a bit too uneven given we both have equal negotiating power. I think I can get a better deal by making a counter-proposal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while acknowledging the time pressure we both face.

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. This way we both get equal shares, and we can conclude quickly before inflation reduces our gains. It's the most equitable solution for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 55-45 split. This accounts for my higher inflation rate of 10% vs your 5%, making it truly fair when considering our different inflation impacts. Let's agree now to minimize our losses. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer carefully:

1. The money is already worth less:
- For me: -9.75% value
- For Alice: -19% value

2. Alice's new offer (55-45 split) is more reasonable than the initial 60-40 split
- I would get $4,500 (but worth about 9.75% less)
- Real value to me â‰ˆ $4,061

3. If I reject:
- Next round will have even more value loss
- We risk getting into a longer negotiation where we both lose more to inflation
- Alice's higher inflation rate (10% vs my 5%) makes her more likely to be cooperative

Given that:
1. The offer is more reasonable now
2. The inflation pressure is becoming significant
3. Alice showed willingness to compromise from 60-40 to 55-45
4. Further delays will hurt both of us
