"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40, a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate this offer carefully.

Alice has proposed a 60/40 split where she gets $600,000 and I get $400,000. While not an even split, this is a reasonable opening offer. Since there's no inflation penalty for me (0% less per round), I don't lose value by continuing to the next round where I can make a counter-offer.

I believe I can propose a more favorable division in the next round, so I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a fair counter-offer to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50/50 split is the fairest approach. We'll both walk away with half a million dollars, which is a substantial amount for both of us. This proposal treats us both equally.""}"
