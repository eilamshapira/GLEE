5556.0,4444.0,"Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $5556 and you receive $4444. This split is designed to reflect the fact that if you wait for the next round—with the money devalued by 20%—you’d end up with roughly the same benefit. I believe this is a fair and efficient start to our negotiation.",Alice,1,
