"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $5556 and you receive $4444. This split is designed to reflect the fact that if you wait for the next round—with the money devalued by 20%—you’d end up with roughly the same benefit. I believe this is a fair and efficient start to our negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 4444 
# Alice gain: 5556 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
