"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice proposes a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
2. However, if I reject, I can make my own proposal next round
3. But inflation will reduce the value by 10% next round, so my $5000 would effectively become $4500
4. If Alice rejects my next proposal, we'd lose even more value in subsequent rounds
5. The 50-50 split is a common fair solution in negotiation games
6. Given the inflation penalty, getting a fair split now is better than risking further rounds
