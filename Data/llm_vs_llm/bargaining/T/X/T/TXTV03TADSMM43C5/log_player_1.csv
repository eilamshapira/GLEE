"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to propose a split of $10,000, keeping in mind the inflation that affects both me and Bob differently. I'll start with a relatively generous offer to increase the chances of acceptance, considering I'm the first to propose.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

My reasoning: I'm offering Bob $4000, which is a substantial amount. Hopefully, this will be enough to entice him to accept, given the looming inflation."
