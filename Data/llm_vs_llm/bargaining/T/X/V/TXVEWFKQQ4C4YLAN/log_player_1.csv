"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a reasonable first offer, considering that I (Alice) am affected by 10% inflation per round while Bob isn't. Since we want to reach an agreement quickly, I'll propose a slightly favorable split for me but not too extreme.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

This is a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is fair considering I'm affected by inflation in future rounds while Bob isn't. This gives Bob a significant portion while protecting my interests against potential value loss in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is too unfavorable for me. Even with just one round of inflation, this would give me effectively $270,000 (due to 10% inflation) while Bob gets $700,000. I'll make a more balanced counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since we're now in round 3, any money I receive is worth 20% less than in round 1. I need to account for this while still making a reasonable offer that Bob might accept. I'll adjust my offer to be more appealing to Bob while still protecting my interests.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

This is a more moderate 55-45 split. Given the 20% inflation I'm facing, my effective gain would be $440,000 ($550,000 * 0.8), which is still reasonable. This offer gives Bob a better deal than my first proposal while maintaining some protection against inflation for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

With 27.1% inflation, this offer would effectively give me only $255,150 (350000 * 0.729) while Bob gets $650,000. That's too unfavorable a split. As we're entering round 5, I need to be careful about the increasing inflation, but this offer is still too low. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round that hopefully can lead to a quicker resolution."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","We're now in round 5, and I need to be more strategic given that my inflation penalty is increasing (around 34.4% at this point). I'll make a more compromising offer to increase chances of acceptance, as further delays will hurt my position more than Bob's.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split. Even with the current inflation, this would give me an effective $328,000 (500000 * 0.656), which is better than Bob's last offer. This is a perfectly fair split that should appeal to Bob's sense of fairness, and I hope he'll accept it rather than prolonging the negotiation."
