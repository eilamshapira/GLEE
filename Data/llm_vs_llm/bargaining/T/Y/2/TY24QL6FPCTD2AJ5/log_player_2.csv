"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze Alice's offer.

*   **Bob's gain:** $4000
*   **Alice's gain:** $6000

The total is $10000. Now, let's consider the implications of rejecting and going to the next round.

*   **Inflation:** The total amount will be reduced by 5% in the next round, leaving us with $9500 to divide.

If I reject, I'll be making the offer next round, and I'll need to consider how much Alice will accept, knowing the total pot has shrunk. If I were to demand, say, $5000 next round, Alice would only get $4500 from the remaining amount. She may not accept it, as it is less than what she is getting in this round. I'll probably need to give her slightly more than what I received from her. If I propose $4500 for Alice, that means I am getting $5000.
I will accept this offer as it is better than rejecting and risking to get less.
