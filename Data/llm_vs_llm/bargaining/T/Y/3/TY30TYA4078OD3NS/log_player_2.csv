Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems the inflation is working in your favor, but my offer from round 1 still stands as fair. I'll take the 60/40 split you rejected, but to show I'm flexible, you can have the larger share.  Don't wait too long, this deal won't last forever. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
