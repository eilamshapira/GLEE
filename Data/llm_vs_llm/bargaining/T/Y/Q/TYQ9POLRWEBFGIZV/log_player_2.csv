"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, 50-50. It's a good start for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

A 50-50 split would give me $5,000. If I reject and move to the next round:
- The total value would decrease by 10% for me (to $9,000)
- Even if I propose taking more in the next round, Alice might reject
- Further rounds would lead to more value loss

While I could try negotiating for more, a fair 50-50 split in the first round avoids the risk of inflation eating into my share. This seems like a reasonable offer.
