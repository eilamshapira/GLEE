"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose 60$ for me and 40$ for you because I value fairness and long-term cooperation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100
2. If I reject and we go to the next round:
   - The money will be worth 10% less for me
   - The money will be worth 5% less for Alice
   - I can make my own proposal
3. The current offer would give me $40 immediately
4. If I make a counter-offer, even if I propose a better split, the $100 will be worth less overall

While Alice's offer isn't a 50-50 split, it's a reasonable offer. If I reject, I would need to secure significantly more than $44.44 ($40/0.9) in the next round just to break even, accounting for the 10% inflation. Given that Alice would also face 5% inflation, reaching an agreement now might be more beneficial for both of us.
