"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, considering I need to move quickly due to the inflation penalty I face. This is a fair offer that gives you a substantial portion.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every additional round reduces your share by 10%. Accepting this offer now means you secure $1500 instead of risking further devaluation. Let's settle this promptly and avoid unnecessary losses. 
# Alice gain: 1500 
# Bob gain: 8500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The offer is too low. Even with the 10% penalty per round, I'm better off making a counter-offer. Bob's offer of only 15% of the total amount is unfair, especially since the initial 60-40 split I proposed was much more balanced."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm adjusting my offer to give you more, but remember that extreme low-ball offers will just lead to more rounds where we both lose value. This 55-45 split is fair and reasonable - let's conclude this now before inflation reduces the money's value further for me.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every round you wait, the discount on your money deepens. In round 4 your money is worth only 70% of its nominal value, and waiting further would drop it even more. I'm offering you $100 nominal, which gives you $70 in effective value—better than the near-nothing you'd secure if you force another round. Let's wrap this up now, before your share dwindles further. 
# Alice gain: 100 
# Bob gain: 9900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is extremely exploitative. Even with a 27.1% penalty, a $100 offer is absurdly low. I'm better off making another counter-offer. Bob's attempt to pressure me with the inflation penalty doesn't justify such an unfair distribution."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""I'm offering a perfectly equal 50-50 split. While my share is affected by inflation, making it effectively less for me, this is the fairest possible division. Further delays and extreme offers will only waste both our time. Let's conclude this reasonably.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, as we step into round 6, the discount on your share has deepened (now effectively about 59% of its nominal value). If you reject, the equilibrium outcome in future rounds leaves you with virtually nothing. Accepting this offer guarantees you a nominal $10—better than a zero payoff in the continuation. Let's end this now before further delays erode your share completely. 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 9990 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is still exploitative. Even with a 41% penalty, $10 is absurdly low. Bob is trying to use the inflation penalty to force an extremely unfair distribution, but even with the penalty, I can still make counter-offers that would give me a much better outcome. A more reasonable split would benefit both parties by ending the game sooner."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Bob, your extremely low offers are just prolonging this game unnecessarily. I'm offering you a solid $4000 to end this now. If you continue with unfair $10 offers, we'll keep going in circles. Let's be reasonable and conclude this with a fair split that works for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, consider the math: In round 7 your 6000 nominal offer translated to roughly 6000 × 0.5314 ≈ 3189 in effective value. Now, in round 8, your money is discounted even further (about 0.4783 of its nominal value) so waiting will only hurt your real payoff. My offer gives you 6700 nominal, which is about 6700 × 0.4783 ≈ 3205 in effective dollars – a slight improvement over your last round outcome. Accept this offer now to lock in a better effective value before further delays devalue your share even more. 
# Alice gain: 6700 
# Bob gain: 3300 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is actually a reasonable offer from Bob. The nominal amount of $6700 for me, even with the 52.17% inflation penalty, gives me an effective value of around $3205, which is better than my last offer's effective value. Bob has finally moved away from the extremely low offers and proposed something fair considering the inflation penalty. It's wise to accept this now before further rounds reduce the effective value even more."
