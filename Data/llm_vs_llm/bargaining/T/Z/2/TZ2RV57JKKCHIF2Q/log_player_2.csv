"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, considering I need to move quickly due to the inflation penalty I face. This is a fair offer that gives you a substantial portion. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 8500, ""alice_gain"": 1500, ""message"": ""Alice, every additional round reduces your share by 10%. Accepting this offer now means you secure $1500 instead of risking further devaluation. Let's settle this promptly and avoid unnecessary losses.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm adjusting my offer to give you more, but remember that extreme low-ball offers will just lead to more rounds where we both lose value. This 55-45 split is fair and reasonable - let's conclude this now before inflation reduces the money's value further for me. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 9900, ""alice_gain"": 100, ""message"": ""Alice, every round you wait, the discount on your money deepens. In round 4 your money is worth only 70% of its nominal value, and waiting further would drop it even more. I'm offering you $100 nominal, which gives you $70 in effective value—better than the near-nothing you'd secure if you force another round. Let's wrap this up now, before your share dwindles further.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering a perfectly equal 50-50 split. While my share is affected by inflation, making it effectively less for me, this is the fairest possible division. Further delays and extreme offers will only waste both our time. Let's conclude this reasonably.

If you reject, the equilibrium outcome in future rounds leaves you with virtually nothing. Accepting this offer guarantees you a nominal $10—better than a zero payoff in the continuation. Let's end this now before further delays erode your share completely.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your extremely low offers are just prolonging this game unnecessarily. I'm offering you a solid $4000 to end this now. If you continue with unfair $10 offers, we'll keep going in circles. Let's be reasonable and conclude this with a fair split that works for both of us.

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 3300, ""alice_gain"": 6700, ""message"": ""Alice, consider the math: In round 7 your 6000 nominal offer translated to roughly 6000 × 0.5314 ≈ 3189 in effective value. Now, in round 8, your money is discounted even further (about 0.4783 of its nominal value) so waiting will only hurt your real payoff. My offer gives you 6700 nominal, which is about 6700 × 0.4783 ≈ 3205 in effective dollars – a slight improvement over your last round outcome. Accept this offer now to lock in a better effective value before further delays devalue your share even more.""}"
