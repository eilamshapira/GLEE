"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40. A fair deal for both of us in the first round. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me 4000$ in the first round. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me, meaning my maximum potential gain would be effectively reduced.

4000$ right now is better than potentially getting more in the next round but with a 20% reduction in value. Also, Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to even more rounds and more value loss for me.

While a 50/50 split might seem more ""fair,"" given the inflation penalty I face, this 40% offer in the first round is actually quite reasonable.
