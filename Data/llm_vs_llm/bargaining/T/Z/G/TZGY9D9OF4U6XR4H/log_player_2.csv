"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer and decide whether to accept or propose a counteroffer.

Alice is offering me $45 while taking $55 for herself. This is slightly in her favor. 

If I reject and we go to the next round, the total amount will decrease by 5% to $95. I could then propose a different split, but Alice might reject my offer as well, leading to further devaluation.

Given that the offer is reasonably fair (close to 50-50) and considering the 5% inflation penalty for each additional round, I'll accept this offer.
