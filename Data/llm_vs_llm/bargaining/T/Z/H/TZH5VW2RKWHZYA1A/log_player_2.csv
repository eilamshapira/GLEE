"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer: $5000 each. How does that sound, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
- She's proposing an equal 50-50 split ($5000 each)
- This is the first round, so there's no inflation yet
- It's a completely fair offer
- If I reject, the next round will have 10% inflation, meaning we'll only have $9000 total to split
- There's no strategic advantage in rejecting a fair offer in the first round
