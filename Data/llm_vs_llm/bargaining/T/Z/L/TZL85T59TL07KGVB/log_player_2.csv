"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think through this. Alice is offering me $40 out of the $100, while she keeps $60. Since this is round 1, there's no inflation yet. If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2, the total value will be reduced by 20% for me, meaning we'd be dividing an effective $80 from my perspective.

I could potentially get more than $40 in a later round, but with the 20% inflation penalty each round, waiting might not be advantageous. If I reject now and propose a 50/50 split next round, I'd get $50 of the new $80 effective value, which is only $40 in original terms.

Given this analysis, Alice's initial offer is actually fair considering the inflation penalty I face. I'll accept.
