"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

The offer gives me $4,000 of the $10,000 total (40%). If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 10% less to me, meaning the total value for me would be $9,000.

While Alice's offer gives her a larger share, getting $4,000 now is better than risking getting less in future rounds due to inflation. Even if I counter-offered a 50-50 split next round, the money would be worth less to me.
