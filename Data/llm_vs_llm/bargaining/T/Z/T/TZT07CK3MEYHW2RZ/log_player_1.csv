"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me think strategically about this. Since Bob faces a 5% depreciation per round while I don't face any depreciation, I have a stronger negotiating position. However, I should still make a reasonable first offer to avoid unnecessary rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose to take 600,000$ and give Bob 400,000$. This is a 60-40 split which acknowledges my stronger position while still being fair enough that Bob might accept it, considering that waiting will cost him money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
1. Bob offers me $525,000 and keeps $475,000
2. For Bob, his $475,000 is actually worth only $475,000 * 0.95 = $451,250 due to inflation
3. If I reject, we go to round 3, where I can make a new offer, but Bob's portion will be worth another 5% less
4. The offer is relatively fair, giving me a slight advantage (52.5%)
5. While I could try to negotiate for more, prolonging the negotiation might lead to a worse outcome if we fail to reach agreement

Given this analysis, I'll accept this offer. It's reasonable, and the potential gain from further negotiation might not be worth the risk.
