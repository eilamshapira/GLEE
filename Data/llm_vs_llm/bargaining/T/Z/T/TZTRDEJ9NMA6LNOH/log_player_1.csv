"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split that accounts for the different inflation rates we face. Since my inflation rate (10%) is higher than Bob's (5%), I should aim to secure a reasonable deal early.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split based on our potential future losses. I'm offering Bob a very respectable 45% of the total sum, while keeping 55% for myself to offset my higher inflation rate disadvantage. This is a fair starting point that gives both of us a good outcome without risking value loss through multiple rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept now:
   * I get $4500, but with 10% inflation = $4050 effective value
   * Bob gets $5500, but with 5% inflation = $5225 effective value

2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make a new offer
   * But we'll both lose more value (I lose 10% more, Bob loses 5% more)
   * We risk further deterioration of value in subsequent rounds

While Bob's offer isn't ideal for me, rejecting it would mean facing even steeper inflation penalties in the next round. The difference between this offer and my initial proposal isn't worth the guaranteed loss from another round of inflation.
