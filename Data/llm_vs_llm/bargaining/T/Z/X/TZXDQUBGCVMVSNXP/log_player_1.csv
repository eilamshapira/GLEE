Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it equally. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage. Inflation might be affecting you differently, consider that and don't let inflation eat away the money value further.

# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
