"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer gives me only 10% of the total sum, which is $100,000, while Alice would get $900,000. Given that there's a 10% inflation penalty per round for me, I should carefully consider if rejecting would lead to a better outcome.

If I reject and propose in the next round, the total value to me would be worth 10% less, so effectively $900,000. Even if I were to propose a more favorable split in the next round, I need to weigh if Alice would accept it.

Since the current offer is quite unfavorable to me and I believe I can propose a more balanced split in the next round (even accounting for the 10% inflation), I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer that accounts for the 10% inflation I've already experienced while still being attractive enough for Alice to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000}

I'm proposing a split where I receive $450,000 and Alice receives $550,000. This is a much more equitable division than the previous 90/10 split Alice offered, while still giving Alice the larger portion. Even with the 10% inflation I've suffered, this would net me significantly more than the $100,000 Alice initially offered."
