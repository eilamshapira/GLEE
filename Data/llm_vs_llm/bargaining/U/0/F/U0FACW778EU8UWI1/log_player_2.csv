"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer...

This is a fair 50-50 split of the $100, which is generally considered equitable. However, since I'm early in the game (Round 1), I could try to negotiate for a slightly better deal. The risk is that with each round, we lose 10% of the total value due to inflation.

If I reject, we'll move to Round 2 where I can make a counter-offer, but the total pot will be worth $90 instead of $100. While I might be able to negotiate a better percentage, the absolute value I receive might be lower due to the inflation penalty.

Given that this is a fair opening offer and the risk of losing value through inflation, I'll accept.
