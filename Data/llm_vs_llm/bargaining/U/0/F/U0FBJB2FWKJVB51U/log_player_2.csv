"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. 

Alice is offering an even split of $500,000 each. While this might seem fair on the surface, I need to account for the inflation rates. If I reject this and we go to the next round, the total amount will be worth less to both of us, but it will depreciate faster for Alice (20%) than for me (10%).

If I make a counter-offer in the next round, I could potentially get a larger share that would still be acceptable to Alice, since waiting is more costly for her.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since we've moved to round 2, I'll consider our different inflation rates. I'll propose a division that reflects the fact that waiting is more costly for Alice than for me.

Given that Alice faces 20% inflation per round versus my 10%, a fair division would give me a slightly larger share while still being attractive enough for Alice to accept rather than move to another round where she'd lose more value.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing this split because it gives me a reasonable advantage while still offering Alice a substantial amount that's better for her to accept now than to reject and face 20% inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 520000 
# Alice gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer carefully considering the current inflation rates.

At this point, the $520,000 offered to me is worth only 81% of its original value due to the 19% inflation on my side. So the effective value to me is $520,000 Ã— 0.81 = $421,200.

If I reject and we go to round 4, any money would be worth 10% less to me (total 29% less than original value) and 20% less to Alice (total 56% less than original value).

Alice's offer has improved from the initial 50/50 split, giving me a larger portion. Given the accelerating inflation rates and the fact that I've been offered a majority share, this is a reasonable offer.
