"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose that I get $60 and Bob gets $40, which gives me a reasonable advantage while still offering Bob a substantial portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of a 50-50 split. It's a fair proposal that gives both of us an equal share, and continuing to negotiate might lead to less favorable outcomes for both parties."
