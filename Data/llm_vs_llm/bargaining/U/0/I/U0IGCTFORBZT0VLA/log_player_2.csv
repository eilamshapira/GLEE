"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 950 
# Alice gain: 9050 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is very unfair, giving me less than 10% of the total amount. Since it's only the first round and inflation isn't too impactful yet, I'll make a counter-offer in the next round for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I propose a slightly favorable split for me, but still quite fair overall. Since Alice has a higher inflation penalty (10% vs my 5% per round), she has more incentive to accept a reasonable offer early rather than dragging out negotiations."
