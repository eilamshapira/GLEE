"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a perfectly equal 50-50 split. This division is completely fair to both of us, with neither player having any advantage over the other. We both walk away with a significant sum, and there's no need to continue negotiating when we can both benefit equally right now. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer for an equal split. This is a fair outcome that gives us both a substantial amount, and continuing to negotiate could risk ending up with a worse result for both parties."
