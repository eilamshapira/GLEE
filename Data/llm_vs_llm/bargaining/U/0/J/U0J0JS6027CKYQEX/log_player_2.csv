"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split with a slight advantage for me as the first mover. This is a reasonable offer that avoids the risk of further negotiations. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer carefully.

Alice is proposing I receive $450,000 while she takes $550,000, claiming a ""first mover advantage"" justifies the uneven split.

While this isn't a 50-50 split, it's still a substantial amount of money, and there's always risk in rejecting an offer. However, if I reject it, I'll get to make the next proposal, which could potentially be more favorable for me.

Given that we're dividing an even $1,000,000 and there's no inherent reason one player deserves more than the other, I believe a more equitable division would be appropriate.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""I propose a perfectly equal 50-50 split. This division is completely fair to both of us, with neither player having any advantage over the other. We both walk away with a significant sum, and there's no need to continue negotiating when we can both benefit equally right now.""}"
