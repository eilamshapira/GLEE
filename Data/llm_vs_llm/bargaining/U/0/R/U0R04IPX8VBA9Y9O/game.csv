450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, your initial offer was quite unbalanced. I'm proposing a more fair split where we both get a substantial amount. Given that your money loses value faster (10% vs my 5% per round), this is a reasonable offer that benefits us both to accept quickly.",Bob,2,

600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, I understand your point about a fairer split, but I think this offer is more reasonable given our differing inflation rates. We both get a good amount, and it's a move towards a more balanced agreement.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",Alice,3,

475000.0,525000.0,"Alice, I appreciate your movement toward a more balanced split. I've also moved from my previous position to show good faith. This is very close to a 50-50 split, which is fair, and accepting now would minimize our mutual losses from inflation. Remember, every round costs you twice as much as it costs me, so this is a good time to reach an agreement.",Bob,4,
