Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer was quite unbalanced. I'm proposing a more fair split where we both get a substantial amount. Given that your money loses value faster (10% vs my 5% per round), this is a reasonable offer that benefits us both to accept quickly. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your movement toward a more balanced split. I've also moved from my previous position to show good faith. This is very close to a 50-50 split, which is fair, and accepting now would minimize our mutual losses from inflation. Remember, every round costs you twice as much as it costs me, so this is a good time to reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000
