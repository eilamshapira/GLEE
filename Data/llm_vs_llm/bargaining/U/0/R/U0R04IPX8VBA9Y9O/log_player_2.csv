"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair split, Bob. We both get a good amount, and it leaves room for negotiation later if we want to adjust. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me $100,000 out of $1,000,000, which is only 10% of the total. If I reject, the money will be worth 5% less to me next round, but 10% less to Alice. This means Alice has more pressure to reach a deal quickly.

Given that:
1. The offer is quite low (only 10% for me)
2. I have more negotiating power due to Alice's higher inflation rate
3. We still have 11 rounds left
4. Alice's higher inflation rate (10%) will make her more willing to compromise in later rounds

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer, but still maintaining some advantage for myself given my better position with lower inflation impact.

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer was quite unbalanced. I'm proposing a more fair split where we both get a substantial amount. Given that your money loses value faster (10% vs my 5% per round), this is a reasonable offer that benefits us both to accept quickly.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point about a fairer split, but I think this offer is more reasonable given our differing inflation rates. We both get a good amount, and it's a move towards a more balanced agreement.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice has moved significantly from her initial 90-10 split to a 60-40 split
2. Due to inflation:
   * My $400,000 is actually worth $361,000 (9.75% less)
   * Alice's $600,000 is worth $486,000 (19% less)
3. We still have 9 rounds left
4. The inflation gap between us (5% vs 10%) continues to work in my favor

While this is a much better offer than the first one, I believe I can still get a better deal. The inflation pressure on Alice is stronger, and we have several rounds left. However, I need to be careful not to push too far as prolonged negotiation hurts both of us.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll adjust my offer to show some movement towards compromise while maintaining a favorable position.

{""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your movement toward a more balanced split. I've also moved from my previous position to show good faith. This is very close to a 50-50 split, which is fair, and accepting now would minimize our mutual losses from inflation. Remember, every round costs you twice as much as it costs me, so this is a good time to reach an agreement.""}"
