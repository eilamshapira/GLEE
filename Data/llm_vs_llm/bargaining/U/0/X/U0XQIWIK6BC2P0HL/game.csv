500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, a 50-50 split is fair. Remember that each round costs you more than it costs me due to your higher inflation rate. Let's be efficient and agree now.",Bob,2,

600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, I'm aiming for a fair deal.  Let's settle this before inflation eats away at our potential gains.",Alice,3,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, consider this carefully - your higher inflation rate (10% vs my 5%) means waiting is much more costly for you. At this point, your 450k is worth about 320k in original value, while my 550k is worth about 469k. This is a fair split considering our different inflation rates, and waiting further will only hurt both of us more.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
580000.0,420000.0,"Bob, this is a compromise.  We both need to benefit, and this offer still provides a significant advantage for you considering the inflation differences. Let's close this deal.",Alice,5,

475000.0,525000.0,"Alice, let's be practical. At this point, your 475k is worth only about 264k in original value due to your 44.39% inflation, while my 525k is worth about 401k due to my 23.55% inflation. This is actually a very fair split when accounting for our different inflation rates. Further delays will dramatically reduce both our gains. Let's conclude this deal now.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, this is my final offer.  It's crucial we settle this now before inflation further diminishes our gains. This is fair and ensures we both walk away with something substantial.",Alice,7,
