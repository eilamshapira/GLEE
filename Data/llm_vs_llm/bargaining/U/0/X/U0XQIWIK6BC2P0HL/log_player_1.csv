Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, consider this carefully - your higher inflation rate (10% vs my 5%) means waiting is much more costly for you. At this point, your 450k is worth about 320k in original value, while my 550k is worth about 469k. This is a fair split considering our different inflation rates, and waiting further will only hurt both of us more. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be practical. At this point, your 475k is worth only about 264k in original value due to your 44.39% inflation, while my 525k is worth about 401k due to my 23.55% inflation. This is actually a very fair split when accounting for our different inflation rates. Further delays will dramatically reduce both our gains. Let's conclude this deal now. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000
