"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer ensures we both benefit from this deal. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically.

Alice is offering me $350,000 and taking $650,000 for herself. If I reject:
- Next round I can make an offer
- The money will be worth 5% less to me and 10% less to Alice
- Alice would need a good reason to accept less than what she's offering now

However, this first offer is quite unfavorable to me - it's a 35/65 split. Since I have the advantage of a lower inflation rate than Alice (5% vs 10%), I can probably get a better deal by making a counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is now worth 5% less to me and 10% less to Alice, I should propose a more balanced split that accounts for the time pressure Alice faces due to her higher inflation rate.

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, a 50-50 split is fair. Remember that each round costs you more than it costs me due to your higher inflation rate. Let's be efficient and agree now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm aiming for a fair deal.  Let's settle this before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice has increased my share from $350,000 to $400,000
2. The money is now worth 9.75% less to me, so $400,000 is actually worth about $361,000 in round 1 terms
3. For Alice, her $600,000 is worth about $486,000 in round 1 terms due to her 19% inflation

If I reject:
- Next round I can make another offer
- Money will be worth 14.75% less to me and 29% less to Alice
- The gap between our inflation rates (5% vs 10%) continues to work in my favor

Since Alice is facing higher inflation pressure and we've only used 3 of 12 rounds, I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that the money is now worth 14.75% less to me and 29% less to Alice, I'll propose a split that reflects our different inflation pressures while being more attractive than my previous offer.

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, consider this carefully - your higher inflation rate (10% vs my 5%) means waiting is much more costly for you. At this point, your 450k is worth about 320k in original value, while my 550k is worth about 469k. This is a fair split considering our different inflation rates, and waiting further will only hurt both of us more.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a compromise.  We both need to benefit, and this offer still provides a significant advantage for you considering the inflation differences. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this latest offer:

1. Current value calculation:
- My $420,000 with 18.55% inflation = $342,090 in round 1 terms
- Alice's $580,000 with 34.39% inflation = $380,538 in round 1 terms

2. Trends:
- Alice has gradually increased my share (350k → 400k → 420k)
- We're at round 5 of 12, so still have time
- The inflation gap continues to work in my favor

3. Considerations:
- Alice is showing willingness to negotiate upward
- Her higher inflation rate is significantly impacting her gains
- We still have 7 rounds, but the risk increases

However, given that we're not yet at a truly equitable split and I still have leverage from the inflation differential, I believe I can get a better offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","The money is now worth 23.55% less to me and 44.39% less to Alice. Given the increasing pressure from inflation and our negotiation history, I'll make a slightly more moderate offer than my last one to increase chances of acceptance.

{""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be practical. At this point, your 475k is worth only about 264k in original value due to your 44.39% inflation, while my 525k is worth about 401k due to my 23.55% inflation. This is actually a very fair split when accounting for our different inflation rates. Further delays will dramatically reduce both our gains. Let's conclude this deal now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer.  It's crucial we settle this now before inflation further diminishes our gains. This is fair and ensures we both walk away with something substantial. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer carefully:

1. Current value calculation:
- My $450,000 with 26.49% inflation = $330,795 in round 1 terms
- Alice's $550,000 with 46.86% inflation = $292,270 in round 1 terms

2. Key considerations:
- We're now in round 7 of 12 (past halfway)
- Alice has increased her offer again (350k → 400k → 420k → 450k)
- The actual value gap has narrowed significantly due to inflation
- Risk is increasing as we only have 5 rounds left
- Alice's tone suggests she's reaching her limit

3. Risk assessment:
- Further negotiation could lead to both of us getting nothing
- Each additional round significantly erodes both our gains
- The relative difference between our gains is now smaller in real terms

Given that we're past halfway, the inflation impact is severe, and the real value difference between our shares is narrowing, I think it's prudent to accept this offer now.
