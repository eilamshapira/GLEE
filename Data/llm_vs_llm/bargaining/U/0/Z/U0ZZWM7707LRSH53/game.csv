60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, let's split this fairly. I propose we start with a 60/40 split in my favor, considering the time decay. This is a good starting point for negotiation and ensures we both get something worthwhile before inflation takes a toll.",Alice,1,

50.0,50.0,"Let's be fair and split it equally. This way, neither of us is disadvantaged, and we both walk away with a decent amount before inflation affects the value.",Bob,2,

65.0,35.0,"Bob, my money is worth 20% less now. To account for this, I need a larger share. How about 65 for me and 35 for you? It's still a decent amount for you, and it fairly compensates for the time decay affecting my potential gain. We need to come to an agreement before inflation gets worse.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
45.0,55.0,"Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, my money doesn't lose value. Let's compromiseâ€”I get 55 and you get 45. This way, we both get a fair share, and you still gain more than in the previous round considering your inflation rate.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
70.0,30.0,"Bob, the money I get is losing value quickly. I'm now asking for 70, and you get 30. It's essential that we consider the inflation and prioritize reaching a deal soon.",Alice,5,

35.0,65.0,"Alice, we're running out of rounds, and I need to ensure I get a reasonable amount. I'm now offering you 35, and I keep 65. It's important we reach a deal soon, so let's make this work.",Bob,6,
