"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split this fairly. I propose we start with a 60/40 split in my favor, considering the time decay. This is a good starting point for negotiation and ensures we both get something worthwhile before inflation takes a toll.

# Alice gain: 60

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my money is worth 20% less now. To account for this, I need a larger share. How about 65 for me and 35 for you? It's still a decent amount for you, and it fairly compensates for the time decay affecting my potential gain. We need to come to an agreement before inflation gets worse.
