"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to be strategic here. Alice's offer gives me only $1000 out of the $10,000, which is quite low. Since I'll be making the next offer if I reject, and considering the 5% inflation penalty affects only me, I should reject this and make a more balanced counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","For my offer, I need to consider the 5% inflation that affects me. Since we're in round 2, the money is worth 5% less to me than in round 1. I'll propose a more equitable split but account for the fact that we might go through more rounds.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm offering an equal 50-50 split of the money, which I believe is fair for both of us. This way we can conclude the negotiation quickly and both benefit equally."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1500 
# Alice gain: 8500 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has slightly improved her offer from $1000 to $1500, but it's still quite unbalanced. With the 9.75% inflation affecting me now, I need to consider if continuing the negotiation is worthwhile. If I reject, I'll make the next offer, but the money will be worth even less to me.

Let me evaluate: $1500 now with 9.75% inflation means I effectively get about $1353.75 in round 1 value. If I reject and we go several more rounds, the inflation will keep reducing my purchasing power.

Still, $1500 out of $10,000 is only 15% of the total, which remains quite unfair. I should try one more counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to be more strategic with this offer. The inflation is increasing with each round, currently at 14.26% for me (after round 3), and will be higher after this round. Alice hasn't shown willingness to accept a 50-50 split, so I need to make a more appealing offer that she might accept while still securing a reasonable amount for myself.

{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000}

I'm offering you 60% of the money ($6000), which is a significant concession from my initial equal split proposal. This gives you the larger share while still allowing me to receive a reasonable portion. Given the ongoing inflation that affects only me, it would benefit both of us to reach an agreement quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has improved her offer again to $2000, but it's still quite imbalanced at 20% for me versus 80% for her. With the inflation at 18.55% for me, the $2000 is effectively worth about $1629 in round 1 value.

Let me think strategically here. If I reject, we'll go to round 6, where the inflation will be around 22.62% for me, and I'll make another offer. If Alice continues to reject reasonable offers and we go multiple additional rounds, the inflation will significantly erode my share.

Since Alice has been increasing her offers gradually and seems unwilling to accept a more balanced split, I'll reject once more but will need to propose a more generous offer to Alice in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to be more pragmatic now. The inflation is affecting me significantly (18.55% after round 5, and will be higher after this round). Alice has been incrementally improving her offers but still favoring herself heavily. I need to make an offer that she's more likely to accept while still securing a reasonable amount for myself.

{""bob_gain"": 3500, ""alice_gain"": 6500}

I'm offering you $6500, which is 65% of the total - a significant majority share. This is a substantial concession from my previous offers, acknowledging the inflation pressure I'm facing. With each round, my effective gains decrease due to the 5% inflation that only affects me. It would be mutually beneficial to conclude this negotiation now rather than letting inflation further erode the value for me while you face no such penalty."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has increased her offer to $2500, which is 25% of the total. With the 26.49% inflation affecting me, this $2500 is effectively worth about $1838 in round 1 value.

We're now in round 7 of 12, and the pattern seems clear - Alice is gradually increasing her offers while keeping a significant advantage. If I reject again, the inflation will increase to about 30.17% for round 8, further eroding my potential gain.

Considering the inflation penalty I'm facing and the limited remaining rounds, I should accept this offer rather than risk getting even less effective value in later rounds.
