"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40, a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice is offering me $400,000 of the $1,000,000
2. If I reject, the next round's purchasing power will be reduced by 20%
3. In the next round, I could propose, but the maximum I could effectively get would be $800,000 * 0.8 = $640,000 in terms of current value

While I might be able to negotiate for more in the next round, the 20% inflation penalty makes it risky. $400,000 right now is a significant amount, and the risk of getting less due to inflation makes this a reasonable offer.
