"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 50-50 split. This way, we both get an equal share and can avoid the effects of inflation together. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 10% inflation for me, if I accept Bob's offer of $500,000, it would actually be worth $450,000 to me (500,000 * 0.9).

If I reject and make another offer in the next round, my share would be subject to 20% inflation, making each dollar worth even less. Plus, Bob might reject again, leading to further losses.

Since Bob is offering an equal split and the inflation penalty will only get worse for me in future rounds, it's better to accept now.
