"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me think strategically about this. Given that:
1. Bob's money loses value faster than mine (20% vs 5% per round)
2. Bob needs to consider that rejecting my offer means his share will be worth less next round
3. We both risk getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds

I'll make a somewhat aggressive but still reasonable first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

This gives Bob a substantial $400,000 while securing a good position for myself. If Bob rejects this, his next round's $400,000 would only be worth $320,000 to him, which should make him consider accepting this offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Bob is offering me $450,000
   * Due to 5% inflation, this is actually worth $427,500 to me

2. If I reject and make a counter-offer:
   * Next round will have another 5% inflation for me and 20% for Bob
   * I could potentially get more, but the total value keeps decreasing
   * Bob might be less likely to accept a worse deal

3. $427,500 is still a substantial amount
   * It's less than my initial offer but not drastically so
   * Further negotiations might lead to worse outcomes due to inflation
   * We've already used 2 of our 12 rounds

Given these factors, I'll accept this offer. While I might get more by continuing to negotiate, the risk and guaranteed loss from inflation make this a reasonable deal.
