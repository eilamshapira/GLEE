"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether I should accept this offer, I need to consider the potential future offers and the effect of inflation.

In the first round, the total amount of money is $1,000,000. If I accept Alice's offer, I will get $400,000.

If I reject the offer, the money will be worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Alice in the next round. So, the total amount of money will still be $1,000,000, but its value will decrease for both of us.

Let's calculate the value of the money in the next round:
- For me (Bob), the money will be worth 80% of its original value, which is 0.8 * $1,000,000 = $800,000.
- For Alice, the money will be worth 95% of its original value, which is 0.95 * $1,000,000 = $950,000.

Considering that I have 12 rounds to make a decision and the significant difference in inflation rates, I should try to get a better offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer in Round 1, it's now my turn to make a proposal. 

Considering the inflation rates, I want to make an offer that is reasonable but also takes into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us.

My proposal for Round 2 is:
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

This offer gives me $550,000 and Alice $450,000. Let's see how Alice responds to this proposal."
