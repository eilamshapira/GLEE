450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. Since money doesn't lose value for me but loses 5% value for you each round, continuing to negotiate works against you. If you reject this offer, your $450000 will effectively be worth only $427500 to you in the next round. This is a fair offer considering our different inflation rates, and accepting now maximizes your actual value.",Bob,2,
