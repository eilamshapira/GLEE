"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll play as Alice and make an offer to divide the $1,000,000 with Bob in Round 1, keeping in mind that delay costs me 5% per round due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because if you reject, we'll move to the next round where the total value decreases 5% for me. I'm accounting for this time pressure in my offer. A quick agreement benefits us both.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. Since money doesn't lose value for me but loses 5% value for you each round, continuing to negotiate works against you. If you reject this offer, your $450000 will effectively be worth only $427500 to you in the next round. This is a fair offer considering our different inflation rates, and accepting now maximizes your actual value. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
