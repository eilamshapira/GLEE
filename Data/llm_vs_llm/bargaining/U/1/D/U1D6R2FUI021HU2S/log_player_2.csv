"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because if you reject, we'll move to the next round where the total value decreases 5% for me. I'm accounting for this time pressure in my offer. A quick agreement benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to think about whether Alice's offer is reasonable.

Alice is offering me $400,000 (40%) while keeping $600,000 (60%) for herself. 

She mentions that the money loses 5% value for her each round, but it doesn't lose value for me (0% inflation). This gives me a strategic advantage if we continue negotiating.

If I reject and we move to the next round, I can make a counter-offer. Since Alice faces time pressure due to inflation but I don't, I should be able to negotiate a better deal.

Given my stronger position, I believe I can get a more favorable split.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that accounts for our different inflation rates while still being reasonable enough that Alice should accept.

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. Since money doesn't lose value for me but loses 5% value for you each round, continuing to negotiate works against you. If you reject this offer, your $450,000 will effectively be worth only $427,500 to you in the next round. This is a fair offer considering our different inflation rates, and accepting now maximizes your actual value.""}"
