5200.0,4800.0,"Hi Bob, since we both lose if we don't agree by round 12, I'm offering you a fair split that accounts for inflation. You lose 5% value each round, so taking $4800 now is better than waiting for future rounds where your money will be worth less. This is a reasonable offer that benefits us both.",Alice,1,
