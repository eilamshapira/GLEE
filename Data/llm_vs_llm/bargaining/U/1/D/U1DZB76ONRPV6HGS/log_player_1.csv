"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer that takes into account the round-by-round inflation that affects Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, 
""bob_gain"": 4800, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, since we both lose if we don't agree by round 12, I'm offering you a fair split that accounts for inflation. You lose 5% value each round, so taking $4800 now is better than waiting for future rounds where your money will be worth less. This is a reasonable offer that benefits us both.""}"
