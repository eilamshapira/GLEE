"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you can counter if you disagree.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. Given the urgency to agree and the decreasing value of money, I believe this is a fair counter-offer. Let's settle this soon. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Rationale (not part of response): I'll reject this offer because even with 5% inflation, I can still potentially get a better deal. My $45 is now worth $42.75 due to inflation, and I believe I can negotiate for more. Bob's opening with a split in his favor shows he's willing to negotiate, and we still have 10 rounds left."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Bob, let's meet in the middle. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. Time is running out, and with inflation affecting the value, this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let's reach an agreement soon.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the inflation and the urgency to settle, I propose an equal 50-50 split. This is fair and ensures we both get something before the value decreases further. Let's agree on this and end the game. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Rationale (not part of response): I'll accept this offer because:
1. The 50-50 split is fair
2. With 14.26% inflation, my $50 is now worth about $42.87
3. If I reject, future rounds will have even more inflation
4. Bob has shown willingness to move towards a fair split
5. We've already used 4 rounds, and continuing to negotiate risks further value loss"
