"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but it affects me more directly as I lose 10% value each round. A 50-50 split is fair and allows us both to walk away with a good amount. If we keep negotiating, we both risk losing value. Let's agree to this equal split. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
