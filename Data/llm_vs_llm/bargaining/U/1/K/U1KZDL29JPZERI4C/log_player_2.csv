"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly! I'll take a little more to account for the inevitable inflation. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's proposal. She's suggesting she takes $55 and I get $45, claiming this accounts for inflation.

While I do face 10% inflation per round, starting with $45 now is better than risking further rounds where the value decreases for me. If I reject and propose in round 2, the $100 is already worth 10% less to me.

However, I think I can negotiate a better split since we're early in the game and I have leverage.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that acknowledges both the inflation factor and fairness considerations.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but it affects me more directly as I lose 10% value each round. A 50-50 split is fair and allows us both to walk away with a good amount. If we keep negotiating, we both risk losing value. Let's agree to this equal split.""}"
