60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob! Since I'll be affected by the 5% inflation each round, I'm proposing a fair split where I get a bit more to account for that disadvantage. This is actually quite reasonable given the inflation penalty I face if we delay.",Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but your initial offer was too unbalanced. This 55/45 split is more fair - you still get a good portion to offset potential inflation, but it's more reasonable for both of us. Let's agree and finish this now before inflation affects you further.",Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"Bob, let's be reasonable. The inflation penalty affects only me, not you. If we keep going back and forth, I lose significantly with each round. A 55/45 split is fair considering I face a 5% penalty per round. If we delay further, both our total payoffs will decrease. This is a balanced offer.",Alice,3,
