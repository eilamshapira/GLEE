"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make my first offer to Bob in this game.

{""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Bob! Since I'll be affected by the 5% inflation each round, I'm proposing a fair split where I get a bit more to account for that disadvantage. This is actually quite reasonable given the inflation penalty I face if we delay.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but your initial offer was too unbalanced. This 55/45 split is more fair - you still get a good portion to offset potential inflation, but it's more reasonable for both of us. Let's agree and finish this now before inflation affects you further. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be reasonable. The inflation penalty affects only me, not you. If we keep going back and forth, I lose significantly with each round. A 55/45 split is fair considering I face a 5% penalty per round. If we delay further, both our total payoffs will decrease. This is a balanced offer.""}"
