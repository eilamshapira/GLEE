"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Since I'll be affected by the 5% inflation each round, I'm proposing a fair split where I get a bit more to account for that disadvantage. This is actually quite reasonable given the inflation penalty I face if we delay. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is asking for $60, leaving me with $40
2. She's correct that she faces 5% inflation per round while I face 0%
3. However, I still believe this split is too favorable for her
4. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
5. The inflation will only affect her portion, making her more likely to accept a more balanced offer
6. The $40/$60 split seems unfair given that even with inflation, we should be closer to 50/50

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while acknowledging her inflation concern:

{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but your initial offer was too unbalanced. This 55/45 split is more fair - you still get a good portion to offset potential inflation, but it's more reasonable for both of us. Let's agree and finish this now before inflation affects you further.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. The inflation penalty affects only me, not you. If we keep going back and forth, I lose significantly with each round. A 55/45 split is fair considering I face a 5% penalty per round. If we delay further, both our total payoffs will decrease. This is a balanced offer. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has moved from her initial 40/60 split to a 45/55 split
2. She's right about the mounting inflation effect - she's already facing nearly 10% reduction in value
3. If we continue refusing, both of us risk:
   - Using up more rounds
   - Alice becoming less likely to accept any deal due to increasing inflation
   - Potentially getting nothing if we reach round 12 without agreement
4. This 45/55 split is actually quite reasonable given:
   - She's the one facing inflation risk
   - We're already in round 3
   - It's a fair middle ground between our positions
