500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50-50 split is fair for both of us. Even though I face a 20% inflation penalty per round, this split is much better for me than your initial offer. If we continue negotiating, we both risk losing value. I hope you'll agree this is a fair division.",Bob,2,
