"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50-50 split is fair for both of us. Even though I face a 20% inflation penalty per round, this split is much better for me than your initial offer. If we continue negotiating, we both risk losing value. I hope you'll agree this is a fair division. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
