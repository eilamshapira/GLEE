"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous. Take 100k and we're done. Let's not play this game for too long. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

Alice is offering me $100,000 out of the $1,000,000, which means she would get $900,000.

I need to consider inflation: if I reject and go to the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me. So in the next round, the $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $800,000 to me.

If I make a counteroffer in the next round, I'd need to propose a split that gives me significantly more than $100,000 to offset the inflation, and Alice would have to accept it.

Given that I can make a better proposal in the next round despite the inflation, and the current offer gives Alice 90% of the money, I should reject this.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer that accounts for the inflation I'm facing.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50-50 split is fair for both of us. Even though I face a 20% inflation penalty per round, this split is much better for me than your initial offer. If we continue negotiating, we both risk losing value. I hope you'll agree this is a fair division.""}"
