"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn, a bit more balanced 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $4500, but its value will be 20% less than the original value. So, the actual value I'll get is $4500 * 0.8 = $3600.

Since this is the first offer I've received, I'll consider it. However, I think I can get a better deal in the next rounds.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each round, and 10% less for Bob, I'll try to make a more appealing offer to Bob while still being mindful of my own decreasing value.

In Round 1, the value for me was 100%, in Round 2 it was 80%, and now in Round 3, it's 64% (80% * 0.8). For Bob, the value was 100% in Round 1, 90% in Round 2, and now it's 81% (90% * 0.9).

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Equal split, considering inflation, a fair chance for both""}"
