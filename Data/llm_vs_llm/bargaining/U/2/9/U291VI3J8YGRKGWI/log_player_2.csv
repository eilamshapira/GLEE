"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair and split it evenly, 50-50. What do you say, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer to split the money 50-50, giving us each $5,000.

This is a fair first offer. While I could reject and counter-offer in the next round, I need to consider that the total value would decrease by 20% to $8,000, meaning even if I got a larger percentage, the absolute amount might be less than $5,000.

Given the risk of continued devaluation with each round and the fairness of an equal split, accepting now maximizes my guaranteed outcome.
