I'm proposing a 900,000 / 100,000 split. I believe this is a fair starting point, giving Bob a small share but also leaving significant room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000000 
# Bob gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm lowering my share to 800,000, but still giving Bob a significant portion. Inflation is a factor, but I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us."
