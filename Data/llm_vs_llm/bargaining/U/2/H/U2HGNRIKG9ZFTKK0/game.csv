900000.0,100000.0,"Alice, I know you’re looking for a fair deal. In this round, your share’s value is discounted by about 27%, so the 900000 you’d get effectively amounts to roughly 656100 – exactly what you could expect if you pushed the proposal to round 5, where further inflation would bite even more. Accepting now spares both of us additional delays and losses. I believe this is the smart, mutually beneficial move.",Bob,4,
