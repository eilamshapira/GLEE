"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"":900000,""bob_gain"":100000,""message"":""I believe this is a fair starting point considering inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, remember that every round delays your payout by 10%. If you reject this offer, you'll have to propose next round and risk ending up with almost nothing. Accept this split now—it's the better choice for you. 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"":800000,""bob_gain"":200000,""message"":""Considering the inflation risk, I’m offering a better split for both of us. Let's work together.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know you’re looking for a fair deal. In this round, your share’s value is discounted by about 27%, so the 900000 you’d get effectively amounts to roughly 656100 – exactly what you could expect if you pushed the proposal to round 5, where further inflation would bite even more. Accepting now spares both of us additional delays and losses. I believe this is the smart, mutually beneficial move. 
# Alice gain: 900000 
# Bob gain: 100000
