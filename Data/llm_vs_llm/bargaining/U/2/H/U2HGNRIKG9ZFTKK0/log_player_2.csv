"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 999999, ""alice_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Alice, remember that every round delays your payout by 10%. If you reject this offer, you'll have to propose next round and risk ending up with almost nothing. Accept this split now—it's the better choice for you.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation risk, I’m offering a better split for both of us. Let's work together. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 100000, ""alice_gain"": 900000, ""message"": ""Alice, I know you’re looking for a fair deal. In this round, your share’s value is discounted by about 27%, so the 900,000 you’d get effectively amounts to roughly 656,100 – exactly what you could expect if you pushed the proposal to round 5, where further inflation would bite even more. Accepting now spares both of us additional delays and losses. I believe this is the smart, mutually beneficial move.""}"
