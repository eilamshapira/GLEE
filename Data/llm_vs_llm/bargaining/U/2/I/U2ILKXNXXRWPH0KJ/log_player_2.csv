"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering me $400,000 while taking $600,000 for herself. This is not an equal split, but I need to consider inflation - if I reject, the total value decreases by 10% for me in the next round.

If I reject, the $1,000,000 becomes worth $900,000 to me, and I'd need to make a counter-offer. Is $400,000 now better than potentially more from a smaller pot later?

Since I'd be making the next offer if I reject, I could potentially get more than $400,000 even accounting for the 10% inflation. However, Alice could then reject my offer, leading to further inflation.

I'll reject this offer to make a counter-proposal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to make a strategic offer considering the inflation effect. If Alice rejects my offer, the money will be worth 10% less to me in the next round.

Since I'm offering now, I'll propose a more balanced split that gives Alice incentive to accept while securing a good amount for myself. I'll aim for slightly more than half while leaving Alice with a fair portion.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering a reasonable split where I get $550,000 and Alice gets $450,000. This is fair considering we both started with equal negotiating positions, and it gives Alice a significant amount that should be attractive enough to accept rather than risk another round of negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate this offer considering the inflation effect.

In Round 3, I'm facing 19% inflation compared to Round 1. This means if I accept Alice's offer of $350,000, it's equivalent to about $283,500 in Round 1 value for me ($350,000 Ã— 0.81).

Alice has now offered me less than her first offer ($400,000), while increasing her own share to $650,000. Additionally, I've learned that Alice doesn't face inflation - this significantly changes the dynamics, as she has less incentive to settle quickly.

If I reject and we go to Round 4, I'll face even more inflation (approximately 27% from Round 1), making the entire pot worth even less to me.

Given this information, rejecting would put me at a greater disadvantage. While this offer is less favorable than the first one, the inflation effect means further delays will likely result in even worse outcomes for me.
