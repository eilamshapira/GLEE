"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose a slightly favorable split for me, offering Bob a substantial portion to increase chances of acceptance. With inflation threat, getting a deal early is important for me, so I'm not being too greedy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The offer is too low for me, especially considering inflation. My $400,000 would actually be worth only $320,000 due to the 20% inflation in this round. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round, though I'll need to be more generous given the increasing inflation pressure."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000}

I'm offering a more balanced split this time, slightly lowering my demand compared to my first offer. Since my gains are now worth 40% less due to inflation (my $520,000 is effectively worth $312,000 to me), I need to maintain a higher nominal amount, but I'm also showing willingness to compromise by offering Bob more than my first proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 380000 
# Bob gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

With 48.8% inflation, the $380,000 would only be worth $194,560 to me. While I need to be careful about further inflation penalties, this offer is still too low. I'll make another counter-offer in the next round, but I'll need to be more accommodating given the mounting inflation pressure."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 490000, ""bob_gain"": 510000}

With inflation now at 58.8% for my next gain (making my $490,000 worth only about $201,880 to me), I'm offering Bob a slight majority of the money. This demonstrates my willingness to reach a fair agreement while still trying to protect my interests against the severe inflation penalty. I hope Bob sees this as a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While it's not ideal, with 67.23% inflation, my $350,000 would be worth about $114,695 to me. If I reject and continue, inflation will get even worse, and Bob seems to be driving a hard bargain. With only 6 rounds left and increasing inflation, I risk getting an even worse deal or nothing at all if we can't reach an agreement within the remaining rounds. Better to secure something now than risk further deterioration of my position."
