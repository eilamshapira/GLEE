"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer doesn't seem fair to me. Alice is proposing that she gets 90% of the money ($900,000) while I only get 10% ($100,000). Given that we need to divide the money and there will be 5% inflation if I reject, I should still make a counter-offer that's more equitable.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more equitable division that accounts for the 5% inflation that affects me.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I suggest we split the money equally. This is a fair division that gives us both the same amount. Since I'm experiencing 5% inflation with each round, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly."
