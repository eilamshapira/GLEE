"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 350000

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the actual amount I'm dividing is 800,000 (1,000,000 * 0.8). For Alice, it's worth 10% less, so she considers it as 900,000 (1,000,000 * 0.9). However, the game's rules imply that we're negotiating over the original $1,000,000, with the value reduction affecting our perception of its worth in subsequent rounds.

Given this, I'll make an offer considering the original amount for simplicity, but keeping in mind the value reduction for strategic purposes.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out. This is my final offer before the effects of inflation really hurt us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the diminishing value due to inflation, I must weigh the current offer against potential future offers, keeping in mind that the value for me decreases more significantly than for Alice.

Given that the money I gain is worth 36% less than in the first round, if I were to receive $400,000, its value to me would be $400,000 * (1 - 0.36) = $400,000 * 0.64 = $256,000 in terms of initial value.

However, since the actual negotiation is over the $1,000,000 and not its inflated value directly, I need to consider the strategic position. Accepting this offer gives me a guaranteed amount, albeit reduced in value due to inflation.

Given the significant reduction in value for me and considering Alice's message implying this is her final offer before the effects of inflation worsen, I will accept this offer to secure some value rather than risking further diminishment.
