"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Rationale (not part of response): This offer is highly unfavorable, giving me only 10% of the total amount. Even with inflation affecting future rounds, I can propose a more balanced split in the next round. A 90-10 split is too extreme to accept."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

Rationale (not shared): I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is assertive but not extremely greedy. This is much more balanced than Alice's initial 90-10 split. Given that inflation will affect me by 10% each round, I need to secure a good amount now. This offer gives Alice a substantial sum while ensuring I get a fair share. If Alice rejects, my next opportunity would be worth less due to inflation, so this is a reasonable proposal that has a good chance of being accepted."
