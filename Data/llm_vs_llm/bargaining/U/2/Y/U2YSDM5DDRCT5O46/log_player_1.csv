"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose a 50/50 split, which is fair for both of us. Remember that with each passing round, the money loses 5% value for me due to inflation, and possibly for you too. Let's reach an agreement quickly to maximize value for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
