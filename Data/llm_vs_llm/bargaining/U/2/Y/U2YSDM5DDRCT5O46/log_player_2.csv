"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60/40 split. Let's get this done and enjoy the money! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer carefully, taking into account the 5% inflation per round if I reject.

While a 60/40 split favors Alice, if I reject and we go back and forth several times, both of us could lose significant value due to inflation. On the other hand, I might be able to negotiate a more favorable split by rejecting now.

Given the 5% inflation penalty per round and the potential for no gain if we can't agree within 12 rounds, I'll reject this first offer to try for a more equitable division.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a fair counter-offer to Alice, considering the inflation factor.

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I propose a 50/50 split, which is fair for both of us. Remember that with each passing round, the money loses 5% value for me due to inflation, and possibly for you too. Let's reach an agreement quickly to maximize value for both of us.""}"
