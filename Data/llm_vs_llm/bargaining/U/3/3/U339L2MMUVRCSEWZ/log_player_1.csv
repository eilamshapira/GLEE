"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Based on standard backward‐induction reasoning in alternating‐offer bargaining—and noting that only you (Alice) suffer a 5% “inflation” discount each round while Bob’s money is immune—the unique equilibrium outcome turns out as follows:

• In the final (12th) round Bob will be the proposer. He can offer you a nearly zero amount (since if you reject you get nothing) and take almost all of the million.  

• Stepping back, whenever it’s your turn to propose (rounds 1, 3, 5, …, 11), Bob’s continuation value (if he rejects the offer) is full 1,000,000 (in nominal dollars) because once he gets the next proposal he can claim nearly everything. That is, Bob would get 1,000,000 if he rejects your proposal in round 1 and then makes the offer in round 2 (where he is not affected by inflation), and the same logic applies in every earlier round.

Therefore, in round 1 your only way to get Bob to accept is to offer him at least his continuation value—1,000,000 dollars. Since the division must sum to 1,000,000, that leaves you nothing.

Thus, the subgame‐perfect equilibrium proposal in round 1 is:

{""alice_gain"": 0, ""bob_gain"": 1000000}

In this equilibrium Bob is effectively better off by rejecting any step that doesn’t give him everything, so you have no bargaining power."
