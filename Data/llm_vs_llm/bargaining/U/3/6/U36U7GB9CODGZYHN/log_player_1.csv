"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split, but slightly in my favor since Bob has the power to accept/reject.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable split that gives us both a substantial portion of the money, while giving me a small advantage as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept Bob's offer now:
   * I get $40, but with 10% inflation = $36 effective value
   * This is much lower than my initial proposal of $55

2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make another offer
   * But I'll face another 10% inflation
   * Any amount I get will be worth 20% less than original value

3. Bob's inflation is worse (20%), so they might be more eager to conclude

However, $36 effective value is too low compared to my initial fair offer. I believe I can get a better deal in the next round despite inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since we're in round 3, I need to consider that:
1. Any amount I get will be worth 20% less than original value
2. Bob's amounts are worth 30% less
3. Bob has shown they're willing to make aggressive offers
4. We both lose value with each rejected offer

Given these factors, I'll make a more balanced offer to try to end the game:

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}

I propose I get $52 (worth $41.60 to me after 20% inflation) and Bob gets $48 (worth $33.60 to them after 30% inflation). This is more balanced than before and should be attractive to Bob given the increasing inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept Bob's offer:
   * I get $42, but with 27.1% inflation = $30.62 effective value
   * Bob gets $58, but with 48.8% inflation = $29.70 effective value

2. If I reject:
   * Next round's inflation will be even worse for both of us
   * I'd need to make a very compelling offer to overcome the severe inflation effects
   * Any future gains will be worth significantly less for both parties

Given that:
- The effective values are now nearly equal ($30.62 for me vs $29.70 for Bob)
- Further negotiations will lead to even more value destruction
- We've gone through multiple rounds without reaching agreement
- Both parties are losing significant value due to inflation
