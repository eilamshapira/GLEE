"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of the money for me in this round, accounting for inflation. The original $1,000,000 is now worth 20% less to me. This means the current value is $1,000,000 * (1 - 0.20) = $800,000.

Bob is offering me $450,000. Let's compare this to what I could expect in later rounds, assuming I get to propose:

*   **Current Value to Me:** $800,000 (total, considering inflation)

*   **Bob's Offer:** $450,000

Since this offer is more than half of the value of money, I should accept this offer.
