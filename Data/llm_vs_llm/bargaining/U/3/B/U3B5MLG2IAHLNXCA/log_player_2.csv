"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice has offered me $400,000, which is a substantial amount, it's less than half of the total $1,000,000. Since there's no inflation affecting me (0% less per round), I have no pressure to accept an unfavorable deal early. I can make a counter-offer in the next round without losing value.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more balanced division that slightly favors me but is still reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I propose we split the million with me receiving $550,000 and you receiving $450,000. This is a fair division that gives both of us a substantial portion of the money."
