"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair offer to Bob considering the inflation risk.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose an equal split of the million dollars - $500,000 each. This is fair and allows us both to walk away with a substantial amount without risking the inflation penalty that would reduce our total gains in future rounds."
