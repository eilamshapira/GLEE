"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I want to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a perfectly equal split of $500,000 each. That's fair in principle, but I should think about the game dynamics.

If I reject, I get to make an offer next round, but the total amount will be worth 5% less (so $950,000 total). I could try to get a bit more, but Alice might reject, leading to further depreciation.

A 50-50 split is objectively fair, and accepting now maximizes our combined outcome since we don't lose any value to inflation. While I could try to negotiate for more, the risk of continued rounds and lost value makes this a reasonable offer.
