"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering we both need to act quickly to avoid inflation.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the inflation rates, my proposal of 55-45 in my favor is fair. It considers the higher impact of inflation on your share, yet still offers you a significant portion. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
* If I accept Bob's offer now, I get $45, but it's worth 20% less due to inflation = $36 effective value
* If I reject and we go to next round, any amount will be worth even less (40% less than original)
* In round 1, I offered myself $60 which would have been worth $60
* Bob's current offer of $45 (worth $36 to me) is significantly worse than my initial proposal

However, if I reject, the next round's value will be even lower due to compounding inflation. Even if I propose a better split, Bob might reject again, leading to even worse outcomes for both of us.
