4000.0,6000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we split the $10000 now—$4000 for me and $6000 for you. Since waiting will cost me 10% per round, it’s best to settle immediately for a fair division. What do you think?",Alice,1,

3200.0,6800.0,"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to settle early. However, waiting affects me too—with each round, my share loses 5% of its value. To avoid further losses for both of us, I propose that I receive $6800 and you get $3200 now. This offer reflects the cost of delay for me and aims to give you a fair share compared to what you might secure if you wait further. Looking forward to your response.",Bob,2,
