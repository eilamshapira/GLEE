"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split the $10,000 now—$4000 for me and $6000 for you. Since waiting will cost me 10% per round, it’s best to settle immediately for a fair division. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to settle early. However, waiting affects me too—with each round, my share loses 5% of its value. To avoid further losses for both of us, I propose that I receive $6800 and you get $3200 now. This offer reflects the cost of delay for me and aims to give you a fair share compared to what you might secure if you wait further. Looking forward to your response. 
# Alice gain: 3200 
# Bob gain: 6800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
