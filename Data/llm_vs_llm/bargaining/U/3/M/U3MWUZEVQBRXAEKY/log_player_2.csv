"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the $10000 now—$4000 for me and $6000 for you. Since waiting will cost me 10% per round, it’s best to settle immediately for a fair division. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6800, ""alice_gain"": 3200, ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to settle early. However, waiting affects me too—with each round, my share loses 5% of its value. To avoid further losses for both of us, I propose that I receive $6800 and you get $3200 now. This offer reflects the cost of delay for me and aims to give you a fair share compared to what you might secure if you wait further. Looking forward to your response.""}"
