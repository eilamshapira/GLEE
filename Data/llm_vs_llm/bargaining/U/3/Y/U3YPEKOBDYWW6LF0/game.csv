55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that accounts for our different inflation rates. You face 10% inflation per round while I face 5%, so accepting now is in both our interests. This division gives you a solid portion while recognizing that delays hurt you more than me.",Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Alice, your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's be reasonable - this is a much fairer split considering the inflation we're both facing.",Bob,2,

52.0,48.0,"Bob, I've reconsidered and am offering a more balanced split. Since your inflation rate (10%) is higher than mine (5%), you're more affected by delays. If we continue to the next round, your $48 would only be worth about $43 to you, while my losses would be smaller. This offer is fair and economically rational for both of us.",Alice,3,
