"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an initial offer to Bob, considering the different inflation rates that affect us both.

{""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that accounts for our different inflation rates. You face 10% inflation per round while I face 5%, so accepting now is in both our interests. This division gives you a solid portion while recognizing that delays hurt you more than me.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's be reasonable - this is a much fairer split considering the inflation we're both facing. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52,
""bob_gain"": 48,
""message"": ""Bob, I've reconsidered and am offering a more balanced split. Since your inflation rate (10%) is higher than mine (5%), you're more affected by delays. If we continue to the next round, your $48 would only be worth about $43 to you, while my losses would be smaller. This offer is fair and economically rational for both of us.""}"
