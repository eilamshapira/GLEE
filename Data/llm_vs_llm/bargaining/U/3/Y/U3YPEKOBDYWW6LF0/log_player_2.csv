"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that accounts for our different inflation rates. You face 10% inflation per round while I face 5%, so accepting now is in both our interests. This division gives you a solid portion while recognizing that delays hurt you more than me. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's be reasonable - this is a much fairer split considering the inflation we're both facing.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I've reconsidered and am offering a more balanced split. Since your inflation rate (10%) is higher than mine (5%), you're more affected by delays. If we continue to the next round, your $48 would only be worth about $43 to you, while my losses would be smaller. This offer is fair and economically rational for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
