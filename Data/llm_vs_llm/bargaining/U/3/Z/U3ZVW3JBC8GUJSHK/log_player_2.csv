"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think through this strategic interaction carefully.

Alice has proposed that I (Bob) get $4000 while she gets $6000. While this isn't an equal split, it does give me a substantial portion. 

In considering whether to accept:
- We have 12 total rounds, so there's room for negotiation
- If I reject, I can make my own proposal next round
- However, prolonged negotiation risks reaching round 12 with no agreement, resulting in $0 for both

While I could counter with a more favorable proposal in the next round, there's strategic value in establishing cooperation early.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I want to propose a fair split while signaling I'm reasonable but also expect equitable treatment.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an even 50-50 split of the $10,000, which gives us each $5,000. This is the most equitable division and demonstrates my commitment to fairness. I hope Alice recognizes that this balanced approach benefits us both and avoids a protracted negotiation that could risk our payouts."
