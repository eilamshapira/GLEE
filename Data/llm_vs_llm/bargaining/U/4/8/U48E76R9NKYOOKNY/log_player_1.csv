I'm proposing a 99.9/0.1 split. I'll take most of the money, but I'm leaving Bob with a small amount to encourage him to accept the offer. I'm hoping he'll be satisfied with this, as the money is likely to be worth significantly less in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
