"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $400,000 and she gets $600,000 of the $1,000,000. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but I should remember that inflation will reduce the value of my share by 20% each round.

Given that this is the first round, and I'm already being offered 40% of the total amount, this isn't a terrible starting point. However, I could potentially negotiate for more.

If I reject and we go to the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me, so the total effective value would be $800,000 from my perspective. Even if I were to get a 50-50 split in the next round, that would be $400,000 after inflation, which is the same as what I'm being offered now.
