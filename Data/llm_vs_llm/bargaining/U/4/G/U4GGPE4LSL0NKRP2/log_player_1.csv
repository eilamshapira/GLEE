"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Based on a game‐theoretic analysis—since the money’s value for you (Alice) drops 20% each round but not for Bob, he is far more “patient.” In fact, in the classic alternating‐offers framework with one party discounting (δ = 0.8 for you) and the other fully patient (δ = 1 for Bob), the subgame perfect equilibrium forces the proposer to concede almost everything to the responder. In round 1 you set the terms, but if Bob rejects he’ll become the proposer in round 2 and (by offering you the barest acceptable minimum, given your discounted future value) nearly secure all of the $1,000,000 for himself. Knowing his continuation value is essentially the full pie (since money does not lose its value for him), your only “credible” offer in round 1 is to give Bob nearly $1,000,000 and take almost nothing yourself.

Thus, in equilibrium you would propose an allocation in which:
 Alice’s gain = $0
 Bob’s gain = $1,000,000

Here is the JSON format offer:

{""alice_gain"": 0, ""bob_gain"": 1000000}"
