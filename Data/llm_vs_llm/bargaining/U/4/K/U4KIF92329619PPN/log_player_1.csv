"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll consider the inflation effect when making my offer. Since we're in the first round, I want to make a reasonable offer that Bob is likely to accept, as waiting would cost me due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose we split the money equally. A fair 50-50 division benefits us both and avoids delays that would reduce the overall value due to inflation."
