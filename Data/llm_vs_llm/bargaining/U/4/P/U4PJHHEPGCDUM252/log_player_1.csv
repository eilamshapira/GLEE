"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split while accounting for potential future inflation if negotiations drag on. A 60-40 split in my favor seems reasonable as an opening offer.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose taking $6,000 for myself and giving $4,000 to Bob. This is a reasonable first offer that leaves room for negotiation while still being fair enough that Bob might accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. If I accept now:
   * I would get $4500, but with 20% inflation, it's worth $3600 to me
   * This is significantly less than my initial proposal

2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make another offer
   * But my gains will be worth another 20% less
   * Further rounds will continue to decrease the value dramatically for me
   * Bob's inflation is much lower at 5%, so he has less pressure to settle quickly

Given the significant inflation penalty I'm facing and the risk of further devaluation in future rounds, plus the fact that this is still a substantial sum ($3600 effective value), I should probably accept this offer.
