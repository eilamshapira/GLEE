"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200}

Let's wait and see if Alice accepts this offer. If she does, considering the inflation rate of 20% per round, my actual gain would be:
5800 * (1 - 0.2)^3 = 2764.8

Alice might consider the effect of inflation on her gains and accept the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Considering the inflation rate of 20% per round, my actual gain would be:
5500 * (1 - 0.2)^4 = 2169.86

It's better to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation in the next rounds. Let's see if I can secure this amount."
