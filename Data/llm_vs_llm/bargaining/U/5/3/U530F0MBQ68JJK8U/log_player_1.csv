"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the inflation and make a decision.

*   **My current worth:** My original offer was for $6000, but now my money is worth 20% less. This means if I accept now, I will get a value equivalent to 6000 \* (1 - 0.20) = $4800 in terms of the original value.
*   **Bob's gain:** If I accept now, Bob will get $5000, which is worth 5% less, so he will get the value equivalent to 5000 \* (1 - 0.05) = $4750 in terms of the original value.

However, I have only 10 more rounds to play, I can try to propose again next time.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for round 3, taking into account that I now have even less value for the money due to inflation (20% less than round 1).

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
