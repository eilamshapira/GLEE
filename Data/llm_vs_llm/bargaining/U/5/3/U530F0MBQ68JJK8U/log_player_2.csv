"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider the offer carefully. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000, which is 40% of the total. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but I need to account for the 5% inflation per round that affects my share.

If I reject and propose in round 2, the money will be worth 5% less to me, meaning the full $10,000 would effectively be worth $9,500 to me. I should weigh this against the current offer.

Given that we have 12 rounds total and the inflation compounds, it's better to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. However, I believe I can propose a more equitable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair counterproposal that accounts for the inflation factor while seeking a more balanced division.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an equal 50-50 split of the money. This is a fair division that gives each of us exactly half of the total amount. I believe this balanced approach benefits us both and helps us reach an agreement quickly before inflation reduces the value further for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully analyze this offer considering the inflation effects.

Alice has increased her offer to me from $4,000 to $4,500, which is a $500 improvement. She's now proposing I get 45% of the total.

According to the new information, my share is affected by 9.75% inflation compared to round 1, meaning $4,500 is actually worth approximately $4,061 to me in round 1 terms. 

Interestingly, Alice is experiencing much steeper inflation at 36%, which means her $5,500 is only worth about $3,520 to her in round 1 terms.

Given this significant inflation difference and considering we're already in round 3, continuing to negotiate might hurt both of us but especially Alice. Her increased offer seems reasonable considering the circumstances, and the inflation asymmetry explains why she might be more eager to settle.
