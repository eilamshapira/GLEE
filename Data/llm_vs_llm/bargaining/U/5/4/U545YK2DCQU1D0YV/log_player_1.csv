"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I need to propose a division of $1,000,000, keeping in mind the decreasing value of the money for both of us as rounds progress. Since it's Round 1, I'll aim for a relatively fair split, but slightly favoring myself to account for being the proposer.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I see Bob's offer. I need to consider the inflation and whether his offer is better than what I could potentially get in later rounds, given the diminishing returns.

My perspective:
*   The money is worth 20% less to me now.
*   Bob is offering me $400,000.

Let's calculate the current value of his offer to me: $400,000 * 0.8 = $320,000 (in Round 1 dollars).

I need to decide if I think I can get more than $320,000 (in Round 1 dollars) in a future round. The advantage of accepting is that the game ends and I secure something. If I reject, I run the risk of getting less later, or nothing at all if we reach the 12th round.

Given the decreasing value and the risk of further rejections, I will accept this offer.
