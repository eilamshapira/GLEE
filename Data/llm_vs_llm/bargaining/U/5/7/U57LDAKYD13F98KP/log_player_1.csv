"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a fair but slightly advantageous offer for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I want to propose a reasonable split that gives both of us a substantial amount, with a slight advantage to me as the first mover. This shows I'm willing to be fair while maintaining a strong negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The offer gives me less than what I offered initially, and I know that with inflation affecting Bob more than me, I have some negotiating advantage. I'll make a new proposal in the next round that takes this into account."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that inflation affects Bob's gains more than mine, and we've both shown our initial positions, I'll propose a split that's slightly more in my favor but still reasonable.

{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200}

This offer takes into account that Bob's money loses value each round due to inflation, while mine doesn't. It's a strategic move that encourages Bob to accept sooner rather than later, as delays reduce the real value of his share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer because:
1. It's worse for me than both my previous offers
2. Bob's share is being affected by significant inflation (14.26% less value for him)
3. My money retains its value, giving me a stronger negotiating position
4. We still have several rounds left to negotiate
5. Bob's real value from this offer is already substantially reduced due to inflation

I'll make a new proposal in the next round that takes these factors into account."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that Bob's money is now affected by significant inflation (over 14%), and we're nearing the halfway point of our negotiations, I'll make a stronger offer in my favor that reflects my better position.

{""alice_gain"": 6200, ""bob_gain"": 3800}

This offer is firm but fair considering:
1. My money retains full value while Bob's is significantly devalued by inflation
2. We're approaching the middle of our negotiation window
3. It's in Bob's interest to accept sooner rather than later as his share's real value continues to decrease
4. I still leave Bob with a substantial portion"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer because:
1. It's even worse for me than Bob's previous offers (4000 vs 4200)
2. Bob's share is now worth 22.62% less due to inflation, so his actual value is only about 4,643 (6000 * 0.7738)
3. My negotiating position continues to strengthen as inflation only affects Bob
4. We still have 6 rounds remaining
5. This offer is significantly lower than my last proposal of 6200

I'll make a new proposal in the next round that better reflects our positions."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that Bob's money has lost nearly a quarter of its value (22.62% inflation) and he's still making aggressive offers despite his weakening position, I'll make a stronger offer that reflects the reality of our situation.

{""alice_gain"": 6800, ""bob_gain"": 3200}

This offer is strategic because:
1. With Bob's inflation at 22.62%, his 3200 is worth about 2476 in real value, while my 6800 maintains full value
2. We're now in the latter half of negotiations (round 7 of 12)
3. Each round further erodes Bob's purchasing power
4. It's becoming increasingly urgent for Bob to accept as his negotiating position weakens
5. This is still better for Bob than getting nothing if we fail to reach an agreement by round 12"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3800 
# Bob gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer because:
1. Bob's real value from his 6200 share is only about 4329 (6200 * 0.6983) due to 30.17% inflation
2. My 3800 would be worth full value, but it's my lowest offer yet and significantly below what I should accept given my strong position
3. We still have 4 rounds remaining
4. Bob's position continues to weaken with each round as inflation erodes his share's value
5. This offer is much worse than my previous proposal of 6800 for me
6. With Bob's significant inflation penalty, it makes more sense for him to accept a higher nominal amount for me and lower for him

I'll make a stronger counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With Bob's money now worth nearly one-third less (30.17% inflation) and only 4 rounds remaining, I'll make a strong offer that reflects my dominant negotiating position.

{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500}

This offer is strategic because:
1. Even though Bob's nominal amount is 2500, due to 30.17% inflation, he's not losing as much real value as it appears (2500 * 0.6983 = 1746 in real value)
2. We're now in round 9 of 12, so time is becoming critical
3. Bob's negotiating position continues to weaken significantly with each round
4. It's becoming increasingly risky for Bob to continue rejecting offers as we approach the deadline
5. This is still far better for Bob than getting nothing if we fail to reach an agreement
6. My position is strong as my money retains full value"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer because:
1. Bob's 6500 is actually worth only about 4096 (6500 * 0.6302) due to 36.98% inflation
2. My position is extremely strong with my money retaining full value
3. We have only 2 rounds remaining after this
4. Bob's offers are becoming increasingly irrational given his severe inflation penalty
5. This offer of 3500 for me is even worse than his previous offer
6. The risk of getting nothing is increasing, but I still have a strong enough position to push for a better deal

I'll make one final strong offer in the next round that should compel Bob to accept given our circumstances."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With only one round remaining after this and Bob's money now worth 37% less, I'll make a final strong but decisive offer.

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

This offer is strategic because:
1. We're at round 11 of 12 - if we don't reach an agreement in the next round, we both get nothing
2. Bob's 2000 at current inflation (36.98% loss) is worth about 1260 in real value
3. Getting 1260 in real value is still much better than getting nothing
4. My position is extremely strong as my money retains full value
5. Bob should recognize that:
   - His negotiating position is very weak due to severe inflation
   - The risk of getting nothing is now very real
   - This offer, while low nominally, is rational given the circumstances
6. If Bob rejects this, we'll have only one final round to avoid both getting nothing"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 43.12% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3200 
# Bob gain: 6800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this final offer because:
1. Bob's 6800 is actually worth only about 3868 (6800 * 0.5688) due to 43.12% inflation
2. This is our last round - if I reject, we both get nothing
3. However, Bob's offer of 3200 to me is the lowest yet, showing he's not negotiating rationally
4. Given that my money retains full value and his is worth less than 57% of nominal value, this offer is highly unfavorable
5. While we'll both get nothing, this is better than accepting such an unfair offer in a position where I hold such strong negotiating power

It's unfortunate we couldn't reach an agreement, but accepting such an unfavorable offer in my strong position would be irrational."
