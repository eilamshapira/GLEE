"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split this fairly! I think this is a great starting point. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, 
""alice_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""My turn! Let's make it more even.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Alright Bob, let's try a 50/50 split this time. Seems fair, right? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $5000 I would gain is actually worth $5000 * 0.64 = $3200 in the original value. Since it's a 50/50 split, I should accept this offer as it's a fair deal and the inflation will only reduce the value further in the next rounds.
