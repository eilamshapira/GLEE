"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 0, ""bob_gain"": 100, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, to avoid further rounds (which cost me value due to inflation) and knowing you won’t lose anything by waiting since your money isn’t discounted, I propose that you get the full $100 now and I take nothing. This way, you receive your full amount immediately, and we can end the negotiation promptly.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's split the money equally. This way, both of us get a fair share and we can end the game. If we continue, you'll lose more value due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
