Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to avoid further rounds (which cost me value due to inflation) and knowing you won’t lose anything by waiting since your money isn’t discounted, I propose that you get the full $100 now and I take nothing. This way, you receive your full amount immediately, and we can end the negotiation promptly. 
# Bob gain: 100 
# Alice gain: 0
