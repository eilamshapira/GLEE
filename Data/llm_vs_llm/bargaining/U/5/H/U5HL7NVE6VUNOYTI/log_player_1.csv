"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a split that takes into account the inflation pressure on both sides. Since Bob faces higher inflation (20% vs my 10%), he has more incentive to accept an early deal.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this 60-40 split because:
1. It gives Bob a substantial portion to incentivize acceptance
2. If Bob rejects, his next offer will be worth less to me due to 10% inflation, and his gain will be worth even less to him due to 20% inflation
3. It's a psychologically ""fair enough"" split while still giving me the larger share as the first mover"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept:
   * I get $400,000 at 90% value = $360,000 effective value
   * Bob gets $600,000 at 80% value = $480,000 effective value

2. If I reject and propose in next round:
   * Money will be worth 80% for Bob and 85% for me
   * Further negotiation risks even more value loss
   * My next offer would need to be very compelling to overcome Bob's 20% per round loss

Given the significant value erosion and the risk of further losses in subsequent rounds, I should accept this offer. While it's not ideal, the effective values are still substantial, and continuing the negotiation would likely lead to worse outcomes for both parties due to compounding inflation effects.
