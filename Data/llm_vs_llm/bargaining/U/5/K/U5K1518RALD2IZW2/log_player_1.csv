"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to think strategically about this offer. Since there's inflation (10% less value each round), I should make a reasonable first offer that Bob is likely to accept.

I'll propose a fair division that's slightly in my favor, since as Alice, I know the inflation affects me negatively each round.

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest we divide the money with me receiving $55 and you receiving $45. This gives you a significant portion while allowing me a small advantage as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48.72 
# Bob gain: 51.28 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer carefully considering the inflation effects.

If I accept Bob's offer now:
- I get $48.72, but with 10% inflation, it's worth $48.72 × 0.9 = $43.85 to me
- Bob gets $51.28, with 5% inflation, it's worth $51.28 × 0.95 = $48.72 to him

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 3:
- Inflation will worsen for me (another 10% loss)
- I'd need to propose a significantly better split to overcome the inflation penalty
- Bob might reject again, leading to even worse inflation

Since the offer gives me a reasonable amount accounting for inflation, and continuing would risk further value loss for me due to the higher inflation rate I face, I'll accept.
