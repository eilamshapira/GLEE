"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me propose a fair split that accounts for potential future inflation if Bob declines.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this division because:
1. It gives me a slight advantage as the first mover
2. It's fair enough that Bob should seriously consider accepting
3. If Bob declines, my share would be worth 5% less in the next round, so I need to protect against that risk
4. The split is close enough to 50-50 to appear reasonable and cooperative"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. If I accept Bob's offer now:
   * I get $450,000 at 95% value = $427,500 effective value
   * Better than risking another round of 5% inflation

2. If I reject and propose in next round:
   * The money will be worth another 5% less for me
   * I might propose a better split, but Bob might reject again
   * Each round reduces the real value of my potential gain

3. This is a reasonable counter-offer considering:
   * The split is close to 50-50
   * The inflation impact is significant
   * Further negotiations might lead to worse outcomes
