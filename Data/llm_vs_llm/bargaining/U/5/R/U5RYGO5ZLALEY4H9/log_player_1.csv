"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, don't risk losing it all!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest solution. With inflation affecting me by 10% each round, delays hurt my outcome significantly. This even split respects both our interests and avoids risking that we both get nothing in the end. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is still worth the same, but Bob's offer is essentially giving him less value due to the 10% inflation, I think I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself while still being reasonable. Since Bob's gain is now worth 10% less than the original value for the second time (1 - 0.1 = 0.9, then 0.9 - 0.09 = 0.81), I'll take that into account.

{""alice_gain"": 65, 
""bob_gain"": 35, 
""message"": ""Inflation is eating into your share, let's settle before it's too late for you!""}"
