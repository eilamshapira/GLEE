"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, don't risk losing it all! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 40/60 split in her favor. While this isn't an even split, I need to remember that with each round that passes, the money loses 10% of its value for me due to inflation. If I reject and propose in the next round, the total value to me would already be reduced to 90% of the original.

Given that I face decreasing returns with each round and we have a limited number of rounds before we both get nothing, this isn't a terrible opening offer. However, I believe I can negotiate for a slightly better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while acknowledging the time pressure we both face.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""I think a 50/50 split is the fairest solution. With inflation affecting me by 10% each round, delays hurt my outcome significantly. This even split respects both our interests and avoids risking that we both get nothing in the end.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is eating into your share, let's settle before it's too late for you! 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice has not only rejected my fair 50/50 split, but has actually offered me less than her initial offer (35 instead of 40), while taking more for herself (65 instead of 60). This is concerning, as it suggests she may be trying to exploit the inflation pressure I'm facing.

However, I need to think strategically. With each round, I lose 10% more value. We're now in round 3, so I've already lost 19% of the value. If I reject and we go to round 4, I'll be facing a 27.1% total reduction in value. 

My 35 dollars now is worth more than what a higher nominal amount might be worth after more rounds of inflation. If this back-and-forth continues, we risk getting nothing.
