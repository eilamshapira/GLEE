600000.0,400000.0,"Let's split it 60/40 in my favor. It's a generous offer considering the inflation I'm facing, and still leaves you with a substantial amount.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Since you're facing 10% inflation per round and I'm not, this 60/40 split in my favor is actually fair. If you reject, your share will be worth even less in the next round. Let's conclude this now for mutual benefit.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
650000.0,350000.0,"Okay, I understand you aren't affected by inflation. But my gains are rapidly decreasing in value. I'll take 650k, which, after accounting for my inflation, is still a good deal for you relative to the decreasing value I face. Think about it!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"Let's be practical here. Due to 29% inflation, your $300000 is actually worth about $213000 to you, and if you reject, you'll face even steeper inflation next round. This is the most rational deal for both of us now - you get real value before it deflates further, and we both avoid a costly delay. Please consider accepting to prevent further value loss.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
750000.0,250000.0,"Bob, my gains are eroding rapidly! This is my final offer. I'll take 750k, which, even with the inflation I'm facing, gives me a little something. If you don't accept, I walk away and we both get nothing. Consider this a take-it-or-leave-it proposition.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
200000.0,800000.0,"Alice, let's be realistic. Your threat to walk away wasn't credible because getting nothing is worse than getting something. At current inflation levels, your $200000 is worth about $111200 to you. If you reject this, next round you'll face over 50% inflation, making any amount worth even less. This is a final, rational offer that gives you real value before inflation erodes it further. Take this offer now, as my next one would only be less favorable given the inflation dynamics.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
999999.0,1.0,"Okay, Bob, let's see how you like this. I want nearly everything. It's a ridiculous offer, but so is this whole situation. Accept it, or we both lose. I doubt you'll accept it, but at this point, I am testing if you are a bot and just trying to get the maximum amount you can.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, I hear your frustration. You're right - I've been very focused on maximizing my position based on the inflation mechanics. Let me step back and make a more balanced offer: a 60/40 split, which is the same split we discussed in round 2. Yes, I know I could push for more given the inflation you face, but I want to demonstrate that I can be reasonable and human. This is a genuine attempt to reach a fair conclusion that works for both of us. What do you say we end this cycle of declining value?",Bob,8,
