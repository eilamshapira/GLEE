"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose I get $60 and Bob gets $40, which gives him a substantial share while acknowledging my position as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of a 50-50 split. It's a fair proposal that gives us equal shares, and continuing to negotiate might lead to less favorable outcomes for both of us."
