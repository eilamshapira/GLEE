"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split while accounting for potential future inflation if negotiations continue.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable split that gives me a slight advantage but still offers Bob a substantial portion. If Bob rejects this and we go to another round, inflation will reduce the value for me, so this is a fair initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept now, I get $45, but it's worth 5% less due to inflation, so effectively $42.75
2. If I reject and make a new offer in round 3, any amount I get will be worth 10% less due to compounding inflation
3. Making another offer risks further negotiation rounds and more value loss
4. $42.75 is still a substantial amount, and the difference from Bob's gain isn't too large

Given these factors, especially the risk of losing more value to inflation in future rounds, I'll accept this offer.
