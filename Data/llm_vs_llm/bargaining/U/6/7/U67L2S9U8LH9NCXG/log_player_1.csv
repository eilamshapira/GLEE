"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer to divide the $1,000,000 with Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose an equal split of the money, where we each receive $500,000. This is a fair division that maximizes our joint welfare and respects the principle that neither of us has a stronger claim to the money than the other."
