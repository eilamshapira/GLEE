,,,Bob,1,reject
4800.0,5200.0,"Alice, let's be realistic. Inflation is hurting me. I need 5200 for this to be worth it.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5300.0,4700.0,"Bob, this is a better deal than last round for you considering the inflation. Let's close this deal and both come out ahead.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, I'm getting squeezed by inflation. I need 5500 to make this worthwhile. Let's get this done.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5400.0,4600.0,"Bob, time is running out. This offer benefits us both. Don't let the inflation eat away any more of your potential gains.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
4300.0,5700.0,"Alice, inflation is killing me. I need 5700 or it's really not worth my time at this point. This is my best and final offer before it becomes pointless.",Bob,6,

5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, I understand the inflation is tough. This is the same offer I gave in Round 1.  Let's be reasonable and end this.",Alice,7,

4200.0,5800.0,"Alice, I'm barely breaking even at this point because of inflation. 5800 is my absolute minimum. Otherwise, it's better to walk away.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
5600.0,4400.0,"Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but we're running out of time. This offer still gives you something. Let's settle this now before inflation eats away even more.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
4100.0,5900.0,"Alice, this is my final offer, and I'm being generous. 5900 or nothing. The inflation is making this almost pointless.",Bob,10,

,,,Bob,11,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, this is it. My final offer. 6000. If you reject, we both get nothing, but inflation means anything less than this is a waste of my time.",Bob,12,
