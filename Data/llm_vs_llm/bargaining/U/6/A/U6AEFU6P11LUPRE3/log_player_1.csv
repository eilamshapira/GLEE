This is a risky move, but I think Bob is bluffing. He's running out of time, and the value of his potential gains is plummeting.  I'm betting he'll take a smaller amount rather than risk getting nothing."

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

It's down to the wire, and Bob hasn't budged.  He's willing to risk it all. While I could push for more, there's a real chance we both end up with nothing. It's frustrating, but accepting is the safest option at this point."
