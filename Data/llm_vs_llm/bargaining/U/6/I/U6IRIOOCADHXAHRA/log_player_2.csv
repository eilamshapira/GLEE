"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to conclude this quickly to avoid inflation losses. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer, taking into account the 20% inflation penalty I'll face if I reject and move to the next round.

If I accept now, I get $4,000.
If I reject and propose in the next round, the total value decreases by 20% for me, meaning we're effectively dividing $8,000 from my perspective. Even if I proposed a more favorable split in the next round, I need to consider this reduction.

While I could potentially get more by making a counter-offer, there's also the risk Alice rejects my counter-offer, leading to further inflation penalties in subsequent rounds.

Given the significant inflation penalty and the reasonable initial offer (40% of the total), I'll accept.
