"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1, keeping in mind inflation will hurt us both if we delay:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This offers Bob a decent amount upfront, which should incentivize him to accept considering the looming 20% loss he'll face next round if he rejects. I get a slightly larger share, but avoiding further losses due to inflation is my priority."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this. Bob is offering me $45 in Round 2. Because of inflation, that $45 is worth 10% less to me than it would have been in Round 1. So, it's effectively worth $45 * 0.9 = $40.50 in Round 1 dollars.

If I reject, the money I gain in the next round would worth 20% less than in the first round.

Given that, I'll accept Bob's offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
