"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the decreasing value for you, I propose 55/45. It's a better deal for you than waiting another round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the 20% decrease in value for me, I'll have to think carefully. Since the value of the money decreases by 20% each round for me, I need to weigh the benefits of accepting this offer against the potential loss of value in future rounds.

Given that Bob's offer gives me $4500, which is worth 20% less than the original value, I calculate my effective gain as $4500 * 0.8 = $3600.

I'll reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Considering the 20% decrease in value for me in each round, I've already lost 36% of the original value (20% in Round 1 + 20% of the remaining 80% in Round 2 = 36%). To make up for this loss, I'll aim for a more favorable split.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a bigger share to account for the decreasing value. Accept now, or it'll only get worse for you!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The value of money is dropping fast for you. My offer of 60/40 is fair considering the inflation you're facing. Let's end this now before it gets worse. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the 48.8% decrease in value for me, I calculate my effective gain from Bob's offer as $4000 * (1 - 0.488) = $4000 * 0.512 = $2048.

This is a significant reduction in value, but I must consider the alternative of waiting for another round. If I reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, the value of the money will decrease by another 20% for me, making it even less worthwhile.

Bob's offer, although not ideal, seems to be the best option at this point. I'll accept it to avoid further losses due to inflation.
