"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I'll start with a proposal. My offer is:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since I'm Alice, I'm evaluating this offer.

In the first round, I was offered $6000. Now I'm being offered $4500, but the value of the money is less due to inflation. I need to consider this carefully.

Given the current offer:

*   My gain: $4500.
*   Effective value is 4500 \* (1 - 0.10) = $4050.

Therefore, I **reject** the offer.
```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 3.  I know the value of the money is diminishing, so I need to be more aggressive.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4250 
# Bob gain: 5750 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze Bob's offer in Round 4:

*   Alice's gain: $4250
*   Alice's effective value: $4250 \* (1 - 0.271) = $3105.75

Considering the decreased value due to inflation, $3105.75 is less than what I was initially offered in Round 1, but the game is getting close to an end.

Given that it's getting risky to reject and end up with nothing, I will **accept** the offer.
```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
