"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a strategic first offer. Since Bob's money loses value faster than mine (20% vs 10% per round), he has more incentive to accept early. However, I don't want to be too aggressive and risk rejection.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which gives Bob a substantial portion while still securing a good deal for myself. If Bob rejects this, the total value will decrease for both of us, but more significantly for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept this 50-50 split now:
   * My $500,000 is worth 90% of original value = $450,000 effective value
   * Bob's $500,000 is worth 80% of original value = $400,000 effective value

2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make another offer
   * But money will be worth even less (90% * 90% = 81% for me, 64% for Bob)
   * There's risk of further negotiations reducing total value

Given that:
* This is a fair 50-50 split in nominal terms
* The time decay is hurting both of us
* I still get a good effective value ($450,000)
* I actually get more effective value than Bob due to different inflation rates
* There's risk in continuing negotiations
