"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000 total.

If I reject and make a counteroffer in round 2, the total value decreases by 20% for me (down to $800,000 effective value), while for Alice it only decreases by 10% (to $900,000 effective value).

If we continue to disagree, the money will continue to lose value at different rates, putting me at a disadvantage in later rounds since my inflation rate is higher.

Given that this is the first round and Alice has started with an offer that gives me 40% of the total, I think I can try for a better split.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more favorable to me while still being reasonable enough that Alice might accept it.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose an even 50-50 split of the money. This is a fair division that gives us both equal shares of the total amount."
