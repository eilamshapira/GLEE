"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a fair initial offer while considering that future rounds will reduce the money's value more significantly for me than for Bob.

{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I'm proposing a fair split considering future inflation will affect me more than you. This way we can both walk away with a good deal right now.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given that your money loses 20% value each round compared to my 5%, this offer actually gives you more value than you'd get in the next round, even with a higher nominal amount. I suggest we conclude the deal here. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Current offer: I get $40 at 80% value = $32 effective value
2. If I reject and propose next round:
   - Money will be worth 60% for me
   - Even if I proposed a very favorable split next round, say $70 for me
   - $70 at 60% value = $42 effective value
   - But Bob would likely reject that

Bob is right - given the asymmetric inflation rates, this offer, while lower in nominal terms, preserves more value than what I'm likely to get in future rounds. It's better to accept now than enter a cycle of declining value.
