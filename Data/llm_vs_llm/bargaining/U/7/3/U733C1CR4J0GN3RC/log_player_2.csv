"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm proposing a fair split considering future inflation will affect me more than you. This way we can both walk away with a good deal right now. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $45 and taking $55
2. If I reject, we go to next round where:
   * My $45 would become worth $42.75 (5% less)
   * Her $55 would become worth $44 (20% less)
3. The inflation penalty is much harsher for her
4. If I reject, I can make the next offer, and the money will be worth significantly less to her
5. Even a 50-50 split in the next round would give her less value than what she's getting now

Given this analysis, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round due to the asymmetric inflation penalties.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since I'm making the offer now, I'll consider that:
1. Due to inflation, any money Alice gets now is worth much more to her than in future rounds
2. She's already shown willingness to make a somewhat fair offer
3. I should propose something that's good enough for her to accept to avoid further rounds

{""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Given that your money loses 20% value each round compared to my 5%, this offer actually gives you more value than you'd get in the next round, even with a higher nominal amount. I suggest we conclude the deal here.""}"
