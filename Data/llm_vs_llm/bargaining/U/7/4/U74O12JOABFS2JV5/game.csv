34.48,65.52,"Hi Bob, to avoid future discount losses we should settle now. Given that my money depreciates 10% per round and yours 5%, if we delay you’d be in a slightly stronger position later. To be fair and efficient, I propose that I receive $34.48 and you receive $65.52. I believe this split reflects our differing rates of depreciation and avoids unnecessary inflation risk. What do you think?",Alice,1,

31.63,68.37,"Hi Alice, since we couldn't agree last round, and considering the inflation rates, my offer this round is $68.37 for me and $31.63 for you. This reflects the increased depreciation on your side and a fair adjustment from my last potential gain. Let's settle this round to minimize further losses due to inflation.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. Given the depreciation factors, accepting your round 2 offer gives me a real value of about 31.63 × 0.9 ≈ 28.47 (in round 1’s dollars), which is slightly better than waiting for the next round where further inflation would erode my share further. I believe it's best to settle now. Looking forward to finalizing this deal.",Alice,2,accept
