"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 34.48, ""bob_gain"": 65.52, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, to avoid future discount losses we should settle now. Given that my money depreciates 10% per round and yours 5%, if we delay you’d be in a slightly stronger position later. To be fair and efficient, I propose that I receive $34.48 and you receive $65.52. I believe this split reflects our differing rates of depreciation and avoids unnecessary inflation risk. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since we couldn't agree last round, and considering the inflation rates, my offer this round is $68.37 for me and $31.63 for you. This reflects the increased depreciation on your side and a fair adjustment from my last potential gain. Let's settle this round to minimize further losses due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 31.63 
# Bob gain: 68.37 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. Given the depreciation factors, accepting your round 2 offer gives me a real value of about 31.63 × 0.9 ≈ 28.47 (in round 1’s dollars), which is slightly better than waiting for the next round where further inflation would erode my share further. I believe it's best to settle now. Looking forward to finalizing this deal.""}"
