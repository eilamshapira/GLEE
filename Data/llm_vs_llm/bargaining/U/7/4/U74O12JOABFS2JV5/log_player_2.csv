"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to avoid future discount losses we should settle now. Given that my money depreciates 10% per round and yours 5%, if we delay youâ€™d be in a slightly stronger position later. To be fair and efficient, I propose that I receive $34.48 and you receive $65.52. I believe this split reflects our differing rates of depreciation and avoids unnecessary inflation risk. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 65.52 
# Alice gain: 34.48 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 68.37,
  ""alice_gain"": 31.63,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, since we couldn't agree last round, and considering the inflation rates, my offer this round is $68.37 for me and $31.63 for you. This reflects the increased depreciation on your side and a fair adjustment from my last potential gain. Let's settle this round to minimize further losses due to inflation.""
