"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split it 60-40 in my favor. I believe this is a fair start considering I'm taking the initiative. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me $40, which is a decent amount, but less than half. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round. However, there's no guarantee Alice would accept a better offer, and we could end up in a back-and-forth negotiation that might lead to worse outcomes.

Since $40 is still a substantial portion and not an unfair offer, I'll accept it.
