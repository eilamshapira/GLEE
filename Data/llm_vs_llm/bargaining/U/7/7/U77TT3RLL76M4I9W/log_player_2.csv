"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000, which means 40% of the total. 

If I reject and move to the next round:
- The money will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation
- The total value for me would be $9,000 instead of $10,000
- I would get to make the next offer
- But Alice might reject my offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation

While $4,000 is less than half, it's still a substantial amount. If I reject and we go multiple rounds with rejections, inflation could significantly reduce the final value. A guaranteed $4,000 now is better than risking getting less later due to inflation.
