600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we split the money 60-40 in my favor. This way, we both get a significant amount, and we can end the game quickly before inflation reduces our shares. What do you think?",Alice,1,

500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe a 50-50 split is more fair. We'll both get $500000, which is a great outcome for both of us. If we continue negotiating, inflation will eat into both our shares. Let's make this deal now and both walk away happy.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, I understand your point about fairness, but considering we started with my offer and you rejected it, I feel a 50-50 split now doesn't account for the risk I took in the first round. I propose we go to 55-45 in my favor, which still gives you a substantial amount while acknowledging the game's dynamics. Let's end this soon before inflation impacts us further.",Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, as we move into the third round, the value of the money is decreasing. My new proposal is a 55-45 split in my favor. This offer still gives you a significant amount and takes into account the risks and dynamics of the game so far. Let's agree on this and end the game before our shares diminish further.",Alice,3,
