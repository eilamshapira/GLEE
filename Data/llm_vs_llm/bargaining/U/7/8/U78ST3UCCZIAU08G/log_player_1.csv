"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split the money 60-40 in my favor. This way, we both get a significant amount, and we can end the game quickly before inflation reduces our shares. What do you think?""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe a 50-50 split is more fair. We'll both get $500000, which is a great outcome for both of us. If we continue negotiating, inflation will eat into both our shares. Let's make this deal now and both walk away happy. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Bob, I understand your point about fairness, but considering we started with my offer and you rejected it, I feel a 50-50 split now doesn't account for the risk I took in the first round. I propose we go to 55-45 in my favor, which still gives you a substantial amount while acknowledging the game's dynamics. Let's end this soon before inflation impacts us further.""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Bob, as we move into the third round, the value of the money is decreasing. My new proposal is a 55-45 split in my favor. This offer still gives you a significant amount and takes into account the risks and dynamics of the game so far. Let's agree on this and end the game before our shares diminish further.""
