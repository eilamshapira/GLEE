"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the money 60-40 in my favor. This way, we both get a significant amount, and we can end the game quickly before inflation reduces our shares. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me $400,000, which is a substantial amount. However, even with 20% inflation in the next round, I could propose a more favorable split and still have both of us benefit significantly. If I reject now, I can make the next proposal, and even after 20% inflation, we'd be splitting $800,000. I could propose a more equitable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while acknowledging the need to reach an agreement quickly due to inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe a 50-50 split is more fair. We'll both get $500,000, which is a great outcome for both of us. If we continue negotiating, inflation will eat into both our shares. Let's make this deal now and both walk away happy.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, as we move into the third round, the value of the money is decreasing. My new proposal is a 55-45 split in my favor. This offer still gives you a significant amount and takes into account the risks and dynamics of the game so far. Let's agree on this and end the game before our shares diminish further. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this. Alice's offer gives me $450,000, but with 36% inflation, this is effectively worth $288,000 in round 1 terms. If I reject and we go to round 4, we'll face 48.8% total inflation. The money is rapidly losing value, and Alice has shown some movement toward a more equal split. While I might get a slightly better deal by continuing, the risk of further value loss and potential disagreement makes accepting this offer the rational choice.
