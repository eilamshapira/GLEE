"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Let me propose a division that considers both our interests and the impact of inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because if you reject, both of us will lose value due to inflation, with you losing more (10%) than me (5%).""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering I lose more value to inflation, I think a 55-45 split in my favor is reasonable. Rejecting will cost you more in the long run. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $4500 at 95% value = $4275 effective value
- If I reject and propose in next round:
  - Total money will be worth even less (90% for Bob, 95% for me)
  - Bob is showing he's willing to negotiate
  - But every round is costing us both money

While I could try to negotiate for a better deal, the inflation penalty makes prolonged negotiation costly for both of us. Bob's offer is reasonable enough given the circumstances.
