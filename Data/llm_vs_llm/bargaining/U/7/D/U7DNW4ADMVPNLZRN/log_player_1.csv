"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer that considers both our needs while accounting for the differing inflation impacts.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because if we go to the next round, inflation will hit your money harder than mine (20% vs 5%), so it's in your interest to accept a reasonable offer now rather than waiting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to consider the inflation effects carefully here. After 2 rounds, my money is worth about 10% less, while Bob's is worth about 36% less. Let me make a more strategic offer.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm lowering my requested amount from my original offer, recognizing that we both lose value by continuing to negotiate. This is a fair split considering the inflation effects, and accepting this now would be better for both of us than continuing to the next round where our money will be worth even less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","I notice we're in a cycle where both of us are losing value due to inflation. At this point, my money is worth about 19% less than in round 1, while Bob's is worth about 59% less. With this severe asymmetric inflation, I'll adjust my offer to find a solution.

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}

I'm offering a more balanced split now. Given the significant inflation impact on Bob's share (nearly 60% devaluation so far), this offer actually gives him more real value than continuing to negotiate. The 52-48 split is fair considering our relative positions and the ongoing inflation effects."
