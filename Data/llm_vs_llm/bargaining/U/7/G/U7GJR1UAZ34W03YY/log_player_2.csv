"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair and split it 50/50. What do you say, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Given that:
1. Alice offers a 50/50 split ($50 each)
2. If I reject, next round's money will be worth 10% less to me
3. If I reject, next round's money will be worth 20% less to Alice
4. I would get to make the next proposal if I reject

While I could reject and try to get a better deal in the next round, the 50/50 split is quite fair, and the risk of losing value due to inflation makes accepting now more attractive. If I reject, my $50 would effectively become worth $45 next round, and I'm not guaranteed to get a better deal.
