550000.0,450000.0,"Alice, your initial offer was quite unfair to me. Given that I face 10% inflation per round while you don't, I propose a more equitable split. This gives you the majority share (55%) while still being fair to me. If we continue to another round, I'll lose value, but you'll also risk getting less than I'm offering now.",Bob,2,
