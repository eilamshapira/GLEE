"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer was quite unfair to me. Given that I face 10% inflation per round while you don't, I propose a more equitable split. This gives you the majority share (55%) while still being fair to me. If we continue to another round, I'll lose value, but you'll also risk getting less than I'm offering now. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
