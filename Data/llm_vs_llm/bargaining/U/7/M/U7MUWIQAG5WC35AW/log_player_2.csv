"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we divide the money with me taking the larger share. Let's secure a good amount for myself. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer isn't very fair to me. She's asking for 90% of the money while only offering me 10%. Even with the 10% inflation per round, I can likely negotiate a much better deal by making a counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I need to make a reasonable offer that accounts for the time pressure I'm under due to inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer was quite unfair to me. Given that I face 10% inflation per round while you don't, I propose a more equitable split. This gives you the majority share (55%) while still being fair to me. If we continue to another round, I'll lose value, but you'll also risk getting less than I'm offering now.""}"
