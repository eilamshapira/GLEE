"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to be strategic here. Given the 5% inflation per round for me, I should aim for a fair offer that Bob is likely to accept early. However, I also need to consider that Bob might reject, leading to future rounds with less value for me.

Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000. This is a reasonable split that gives me a slight advantage while still being fair enough that Bob might accept it immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this carefully. With a 5% inflation per round for me, the $500,000 offered to me is now worth approximately $475,000 in round 1 terms. If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 3, any money I receive would be worth another 5% less.

If I reject, I'd have to propose something better in round 3, but Bob might reject that too, leading to further rounds with increasing inflation for me. Given the asymmetric inflation penalty, it's generally in my interest to reach an agreement sooner rather than later.

A 50-50 split is objectively fair in absolute terms, though it does give Bob a slight advantage due to the inflation factor. However, this is a reasonable offer that I should accept.
