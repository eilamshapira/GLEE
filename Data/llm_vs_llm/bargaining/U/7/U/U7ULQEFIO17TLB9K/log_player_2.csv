"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm proposing an equal split of the money. This seems fair to both of us, and with inflation affecting me by 10% each round, it makes sense to agree quickly. Let's both walk away with a good amount rather than losing value through delays. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the offer is an equal split, which seems fair, and considering the inflation factor, it's reasonable to accept the offer to avoid losing value through delays.
