Round 2

# Bob's message: I understand your concern about inflation, but since we don't know exactly how it affects you, let's start with a perfectly equal split. This is fair for both of us, and we can avoid prolonging the negotiation which could reduce the value due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

However, since I'm not affected by inflation, I'm in a position to ask for a bit more. This offer gives you a substantial amount while acknowledging our different positions. Let's finalize this deal now to prevent further loss of value for you due to inflation.
