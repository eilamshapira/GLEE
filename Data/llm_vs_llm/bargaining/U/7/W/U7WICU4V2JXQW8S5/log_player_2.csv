"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it reasonably. I get a bit more to account for potential inflation affecting me more. This is a fair offer, Bob! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is asking for $5,500 while offering me $4,500, claiming she needs more to account for potential inflation affecting her. However, I've been told that inflation doesn't affect me (0% inflation rate), and I don't know how it affects Alice.

Since this is just the first round of potentially 12 rounds, I have plenty of opportunities to make counter-offers. If I reject, I'll be able to make my own proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counterproposal that's more balanced while acknowledging Alice's concern about inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""I understand your concern about inflation, but since we don't know exactly how it affects you, let's start with a perfectly equal split. This is fair for both of us, and we can avoid prolonging the negotiation which could reduce the value due to inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, inflation is eating away at my potential gains. I'm slightly reducing my ask from the first round. Let's agree on this to avoid further losses for both of us. This is still a very fair offer considering the situation. 
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this new offer carefully. Alice has reduced her ask from $5,500 to $5,300, offering me $4,700 instead of the initial $4,500. She mentions that inflation is affecting her gains, which is now confirmed - she's experiencing 9.75% inflation since the first round.

While this offer is better than her first one, I still have the advantage of not being affected by inflation (0% for me). If I reject, I can make another offer in the next round, but Alice will be affected by even more inflation.

Given that Alice has moved in my direction and inflation is genuinely affecting her, this offer is more reasonable than the first one. However, I still believe I can negotiate for a slightly better split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5100, 
""alice_gain"": 4900, 
""message"": ""Alice, I understand inflation is affecting your gains, which puts you at a disadvantage as we negotiate. However, since I'm not affected by inflation, I'm in a position to ask for a bit more. This offer gives you a substantial amount while acknowledging our different positions. Let's finalize this deal now to prevent further loss of value for you due to inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm going down to 5100. This is my best offer considering the continuing inflation and the dwindling number of rounds. Take it now before we both lose everything. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice has reduced her request further to $5,100 (down from $5,300 in round 3 and $5,500 in round 1), while offering me $4,900. She's experiencing significant inflation effects now - 18.55% less value than in the first round.

This is getting closer to an even split, and Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation. If I reject, I can make another counter-offer, but we're now in round 5 of 12, so we need to be mindful of eventually reaching an agreement.

Given that Alice has moved significantly toward my position and inflation continues to affect her but not me, this offer is becoming more reasonable. The difference between our positions is now just $200, which is relatively small compared to the total amount.
