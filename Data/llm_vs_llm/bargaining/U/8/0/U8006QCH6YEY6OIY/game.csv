6000.0,4000.0,"I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because if you reject, the money will be worth less to you next round due to inflation.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Considering the inflation, I think 55-45 is a fair split. If you reject, I'll have to offer less in the next round.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6500.0,3500.0,"Due to the 20% cumulative inflation on your side, this 3500 is actually worth even less to you now. I suggest you accept this offer, as future rounds will only decrease the value further for you.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4200.0,5800.0,"I'm willing to take a higher share to compensate for the inflation loss. This is my best offer so far, consider it carefully.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
7000.0,3000.0,The inflation has reduced your buying power by over 30% now. This 3000 will be worth even less to you if you wait longer. This is a reasonable offer given the circumstances - you should accept now while you can still get meaningful value.,Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Despite the inflation, I'm still willing to negotiate. However, I need a larger share to offset the loss. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
7500.0,2500.0,"Bob, the inflation has now reduced your buying power by nearly 45%. This 2500 now is worth more to you than a larger amount in future rounds. If you reject, I'll have to offer even less next time as your inflation keeps increasing.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
3800.0,6200.0,"I understand the impact of inflation, but I'm not willing to give up too much. This is my best offer considering the current situation. If you reject, I'll have to reevaluate my strategy.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
8000.0,2000.0,"Bob, with over 55% inflation on your side, this 2000 is your best realistic option now. Your buying power is severely diminished, and waiting longer will only make it worse. This is still better than what you'd effectively get in later rounds.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
3500.0,6500.0,"I know the inflation is severe, but I'm trying to maximize my gain. This is a high-risk offer, but I'm willing to take the chance. If you reject, I'll have to make a tough decision in the next rounds.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
8500.0,1500.0,"Bob, this is the second-to-last round. With inflation over 65% on your side, even a larger amount would be worth very little to you. This 1500 now is better than risking getting nothing in the final round. Please be rational and accept.",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"This is my final offer. I know the inflation is extreme, but I'm willing to gamble for the highest possible gain. If you reject, we both get nothing. I'm counting on you to prefer something over nothing.",Bob,12,
