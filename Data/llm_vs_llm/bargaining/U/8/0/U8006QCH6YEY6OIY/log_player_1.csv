"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because if you reject, the money will be worth less to you next round due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I think 55-45 is a fair split. If you reject, I'll have to offer less in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The inflation only affects Bob's value, not mine. I can get a better deal by making another offer, since Bob's value of the money will decrease further next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6500, 
""bob_gain"": 3500, 
""message"": ""Due to the 20% cumulative inflation on your side, this 3500 is actually worth even less to you now. I suggest you accept this offer, as future rounds will only decrease the value further for you.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a higher share to compensate for the inflation loss. This is my best offer so far, consider it carefully. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The inflation effect is making Bob's position weaker with each round. Since I'm not affected by inflation, I can afford to wait and potentially get a better deal. The 5800 Bob is asking for is worth significantly less to him now due to the 27.1% inflation, and this effect will only increase in future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7000, 
""bob_gain"": 3000, 
""message"": ""The inflation has reduced your buying power by over 30% now. This 3000 will be worth even less to you if you wait longer. This is a reasonable offer given the circumstances - you should accept now while you can still get meaningful value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Despite the inflation, I'm still willing to negotiate. However, I need a larger share to offset the loss. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's position continues to weaken. The 6000 he's asking for is worth only about 3540 to him due to the 41% inflation, while my 4000 would still be worth the full 4000. I can get a better deal by making another offer, as the inflation will continue to erode Bob's bargaining power."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7500, 
""bob_gain"": 2500, 
""message"": ""Bob, the inflation has now reduced your buying power by nearly 45%. This 2500 now is worth more to you than a larger amount in future rounds. If you reject, I'll have to offer even less next time as your inflation keeps increasing.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the impact of inflation, but I'm not willing to give up too much. This is my best offer considering the current situation. If you reject, I'll have to reevaluate my strategy. 
# Alice gain: 3800 
# Bob gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The math continues to work in my favor. Bob's 6200 is now only worth about 2965 to him due to the 52.17% inflation, while my 3800 would still be worth the full amount. With 4 rounds remaining and Bob's value continuing to decrease, I can still push for a better deal. The inflation effect is severely weakening Bob's negotiating position."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 8000, 
""bob_gain"": 2000, 
""message"": ""Bob, with over 55% inflation on your side, this 2000 is your best realistic option now. Your buying power is severely diminished, and waiting longer will only make it worse. This is still better than what you'd effectively get in later rounds.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I know the inflation is severe, but I'm trying to maximize my gain. This is a high-risk offer, but I'm willing to take the chance. If you reject, I'll have to make a tough decision in the next rounds. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

With only 2 rounds left after this and Bob's money now worth only 38.74% of its original value, I'll continue to reject. Bob's 6500 is only worth about 2517 to him due to the 61.26% inflation, while my 3500 would still be worth the full amount. The risk of getting nothing is increasing, but Bob's position is so weak that I believe I can still secure a better deal in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 8500, 
""bob_gain"": 1500, 
""message"": ""Bob, this is the second-to-last round. With inflation over 65% on your side, even a larger amount would be worth very little to you. This 1500 now is better than risking getting nothing in the final round. Please be rational and accept.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 68.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. I know the inflation is extreme, but I'm willing to gamble for the highest possible gain. If you reject, we both get nothing. I'm counting on you to prefer something over nothing. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

While this isn't the best offer, I'll accept it because it's the final round and getting 3000 is better than getting nothing. Bob's 7000 is only worth about 2197 to him due to the 68.62% inflation, while my 3000 is worth the full amount. Although I could have potentially gotten more in earlier rounds, the risk of getting nothing now outweighs the potential benefits of rejection."
