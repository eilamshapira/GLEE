510000.0,490000.0,"Bob, let's be practical here. With inflation affecting me by 10% each round, this offer will give me $459000 in real value. You get a very fair $490000. If we keep going, we both risk losing more value. This is a balanced deal that benefits us both.",Alice,3,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I understand your concerns about inflation, but I'm taking a bigger hit at 19% loss already. I need to secure a larger share to offset this loss. This offer is still generous considering the circumstances.",Bob,4,
