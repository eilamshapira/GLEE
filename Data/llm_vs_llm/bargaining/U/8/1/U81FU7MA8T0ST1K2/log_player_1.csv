"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think your initial offer was a bit one-sided. Considering the inflation risk, I'm willing to take a slightly larger share to secure my part, but still offer you a substantial amount. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The inflation impact means I'd only get $427,500 in real value (90% of $475,000). I can make a better offer in the next round that still leaves us both better off than risking further rounds of inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 510000,
""bob_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical here. With inflation affecting me by 10% each round, this offer will give me $459,000 in real value. You get a very fair $490,000. If we keep going, we both risk losing more value. This is a balanced deal that benefits us both.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns about inflation, but I'm taking a bigger hit at 19% loss already. I need to secure a larger share to offset this loss. This offer is still generous considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because with inflation affecting future rounds, my real value would be $328,050 (72.9% of $450,000) if I accept now. If I reject and we continue, even if I get a larger nominal amount in the next round, the 37.1% inflation impact would likely result in less real value. It's better to secure this amount now than risk further devaluation."
