"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split where I get slightly more since I'm making the first offer. This way we both walk away with a substantial amount without risking inflation losses.

# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

""alice_gain"": 475000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I think your initial offer was a bit one-sided. Considering the inflation risk, I'm willing to take a slightly larger share to secure my part, but still offer you a substantial amount.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical here. With inflation affecting me by 10% each round, this offer will give me $459000 in real value. You get a very fair $490000. If we keep going, we both risk losing more value. This is a balanced deal that benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concerns about inflation, but I'm taking a bigger hit at 19% loss already. I need to secure a larger share to offset this loss. This offer is still generous considering the circumstances.""}"
