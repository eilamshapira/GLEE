"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let me propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable split that gives both of us a substantial portion, while giving me a small advantage as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this carefully:

1. If I accept this offer now:
   * I get $40, but with 10% inflation = $36 real value
   * Bob gets $60 at full value

2. If I reject and make a counter-offer:
   * The next round will have another 10% inflation for me
   * I might be able to get more nominally, but it would be worth even less
   * There's no guarantee Bob would accept my counter-offer

3. The current offer gives me a decent portion ($36 in real value), and continuing the negotiation would reduce my purchasing power further.
