0.0,1000000.0,"Hi Bob, in Round 1 I’m offering you the full $1000000. I know that if you reject this offer, you’ll get to propose in Round 2—and given that only my share is discounted over time while your share isn’t, you’d get $1000000 anyway. To avoid any further delay (and my additional discounting), please accept this offer now.",Alice,1,
