"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Based on the rules you described—and assuming that Bob is perfectly rational and is never affected by the inflation while I (Alice) lose 5% of my money’s value each round—the backward‐induction equilibrium works out roughly as follows:

• If I (Alice) try to claim any positive share in Round 1, then Bob (as the responder) knows that by rejecting he becomes the proposer in Round 2. Since Bob’s money doesn’t devalue, he can later propose a split that gives him almost the entire $100 (leaving Alice a nearly negligible amount that, compounded by her 5% devaluation, would be even worse).  
• In consequence, Bob’s “threat point” in Round 1 is effectively $100. That means he will only accept a proposal in Round 1 if he receives the full $100 right away.  
• Therefore, in a subgame‐perfect equilibrium, my only “peaceful” offer (one that Bob is willing to accept immediately) is to give Bob the entire $100 and take $0 myself.  

Thus, my JSON proposal in Round 1 is:

{""alice_gain"": 0, ""bob_gain"": 100}"
