"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we divide the $10,000 by awarding me $6000 and you $4000. Given that further rounds will reduce my portion by 5% each time, I believe this split fairly reflects our shared interests in reaching an early agreement. I hope you find this acceptable so we can both avoid unnecessary losses.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand we both face inflation, though at different rates (10% for me, 5% for you). Your initial offer gave you 60% of the total, which seems unbalanced. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor, which is fair considering I face higher inflation costs. This way we can both avoid further devaluation of our shares and reach an agreement quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 4800, ""bob_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your proposal and comments on inflation. Since every round we delay reduces our shares further—with my share now worth 5% less than at the start and, as you mentioned, your share losing 10% per round—I believe it's in both our interests to settle soon. In round 3, I propose that I receive $4800 and you receive $5200. This offer takes into account your steeper loss due to inflation while still providing a fair division overall. I hope we can agree on this now to avoid further devaluation on either side.""}"
