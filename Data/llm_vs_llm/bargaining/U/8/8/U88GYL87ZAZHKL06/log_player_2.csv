"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we divide the $10000 by awarding me $6000 and you $4000. Given that further rounds will reduce my portion by 5% each time, I believe this split fairly reflects our shared interests in reaching an early agreement. I hope you find this acceptable so we can both avoid unnecessary losses. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. With 10% inflation per round for me, if I reject, the money will be worth less for me in future rounds. However, Alice is offering me less than half of the total amount. 

If I make a counteroffer in Round 2, the total value for me would be $9,000 (due to 10% inflation), and I could propose a more favorable split. 

Given that we have 12 rounds total and Alice mentioned she faces 5% inflation per round, I think I can get a better deal by proceeding to the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a fair counteroffer that takes into account our different inflation rates.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand we both face inflation, though at different rates (10% for me, 5% for you). Your initial offer gave you 60% of the total, which seems unbalanced. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor, which is fair considering I face higher inflation costs. This way we can both avoid further devaluation of our shares and reach an agreement quickly.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your proposal and comments on inflation. Since every round we delay reduces our shares further—with my share now worth 5% less than at the start and, as you mentioned, your share losing 10% per round—I believe it's in both our interests to settle soon. In round 3, I propose that I receive $4800 and you receive $5200. This offer takes into account your steeper loss due to inflation while still providing a fair division overall. I hope we can agree on this now to avoid further devaluation on either side. 
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. 

Alice is now offering me $5200, which is better than her initial offer of $4000. Due to my 19% inflation at this point, this $5200 is worth about $4212 in round 1 terms. That's still slightly better than her original offer.

Alice has moved considerably from her initial position, offering me the majority share now. If I reject and we continue to round 4, my inflation will increase to 29%, further reducing the value of any amount.

Since Alice has made a significant concession and is now offering me more than half of the total amount, and considering my higher inflation rate making future negotiations less valuable for me, I should accept this offer.
