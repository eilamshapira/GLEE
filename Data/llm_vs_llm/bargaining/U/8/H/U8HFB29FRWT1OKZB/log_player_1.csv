"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we settle now with a split that takes into account our different devaluation rates. You would get $40 and I would get $60. Accepting this offer now spares you from further loss of value in later rounds. Looking forward to a fair and swift agreement!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the rapid devaluation for both of us, I propose a 50-50 split this round. This is fair and ensures we both get a reasonable amount before the value drops further. Let's agree on this and end the game now. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
