Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we settle now with a split that takes into account our different devaluation rates. You would get $40 and I would get $60. Accepting this offer now spares you from further loss of value in later rounds. Looking forward to a fair and swift agreement! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60
