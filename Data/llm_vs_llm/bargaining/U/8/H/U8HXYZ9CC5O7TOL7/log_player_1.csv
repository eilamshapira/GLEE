Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the decreasing value of money for you, I propose a 55/45 split. This offer considers your urgency and still gives you a substantial amount. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
