"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I need to propose a split of the $1,000,000, keeping in mind the diminishing value of the money for Bob in future rounds. Here's my initial offer, aiming for a relatively fair split to encourage acceptance and avoid further losses due to inflation:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob's offer is a 50/50 split. Considering the inflation affecting Bob, and the relatively small amount of inflation affecting me (0%), it's strategically beneficial for me to accept this offer.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
