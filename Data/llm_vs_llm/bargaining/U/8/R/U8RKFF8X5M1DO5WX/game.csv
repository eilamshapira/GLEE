550000.0,450000.0,I suggest a fair split where I get slightly more as the first mover. This way we can both walk away with a substantial amount without risking inflation losses.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Let's split it down the middle.  We both get the same, and we both get it now.  No need to risk inflation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
625000.0,375000.0,"Due to the 20% inflation penalty I face each round, I need a larger nominal amount to achieve fair real value. This split would give us approximately equal purchasing power, as my 625k is worth 500k to me after inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"I'm willing to give you a slight edge, but I'm not going to let you take the lion's share. Let's meet in the middle - my offer is a compromise.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
700000.0,300000.0,"After nearly 50% inflation on my end, I need 700k to get about 358k in real value. You still get your 300k at full value. This split makes our real purchasing power much more equal, considering the inflation I face.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"I'm willing to budge a little, but I'm not going to let you take everything. Let's find a compromise that's fair to both of us.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
800000.0,200000.0,"With 67% inflation affecting me, I need 800k to get only about 262k in real value, while your 200k maintains full value. This split actually gives us similar purchasing power. If we keep negotiating, inflation will hurt us both as my purchasing power continues to decrease.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
650000.0,350000.0,"Alice, we're both losing money with each round.  I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I need something to make it worthwhile for me.  Let's end this before inflation eats away at our gains completely.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
850000.0,150000.0,"Bob, with 79% inflation, my 850k is only worth about 178k to me in real value, while your 150k maintains full value. We're running out of rounds, and my purchasing power is severely diminished. This split would give us roughly equal real value - please consider accepting so we don't both end up with nothing.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
700000.0,300000.0,"Alice, we're running out of time. This is my final offer - it's the best I can do.  Let's end this before we both lose everything.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,accept
