"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I suggest a fair split where I get slightly more as the first mover. This way we can both walk away with a substantial amount without risking inflation losses.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle.  We both get the same, and we both get it now.  No need to risk inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The reasoning is that due to 20% inflation, $500,000 would only be worth $400,000 to me in this round. I should make a counter-offer that accounts for this inflation effect to achieve a more equitable split in terms of real value."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 625000, ""bob_gain"": 375000, ""message"": ""Due to the 20% inflation penalty I face each round, I need a larger nominal amount to achieve fair real value. This split would give us approximately equal purchasing power, as my 625k is worth 500k to me after inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slight edge, but I'm not going to let you take the lion's share. Let's meet in the middle - my offer is a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

With 48.8% inflation at this point, the $550,000 would only be worth about $281,600 to me in real terms, while Bob's $450,000 maintains its full value. This is not an equitable split given the inflation penalty I face. I should counter with an offer that better accounts for the increasing inflation effect."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""After nearly 50% inflation on my end, I need 700k to get about 358k in real value. You still get your 300k at full value. This split makes our real purchasing power much more equal, considering the inflation I face.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to budge a little, but I'm not going to let you take everything. Let's find a compromise that's fair to both of us. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

With 67.23% inflation at this point, the $600,000 would only be worth about $196,620 to me in real terms, while Bob's $400,000 maintains its full value. This is still not an equitable split given the severe inflation penalty I face. We're halfway through our rounds, and the inflation is getting quite serious, so I need to continue negotiating for a better split."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""With 67% inflation affecting me, I need 800k to get only about 262k in real value, while your 200k maintains full value. This split actually gives us similar purchasing power. If we keep negotiating, inflation will hurt us both as my purchasing power continues to decrease.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing money with each round.  I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I need something to make it worthwhile for me.  Let's end this before inflation eats away at our gains completely. 
# Alice gain: 650000 
# Bob gain: 350000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

With 79.03% inflation, the $650,000 would only be worth about $136,305 to me in real terms, while Bob's $350,000 maintains its full value. Despite Bob's valid point about inflation eating away our gains, this split still gives Bob more than twice my real purchasing power. With only 4 rounds left, I need to negotiate for a better split to compensate for the severe inflation I'm facing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000, ""message"": ""Bob, with 79% inflation, my 850k is only worth about 178k to me in real value, while your 150k maintains full value. We're running out of rounds, and my purchasing power is severely diminished. This split would give us roughly equal real value - please consider accepting so we don't both end up with nothing.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time. This is my final offer - it's the best I can do.  Let's end this before we both lose everything. 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

While not ideal (the $700,000 is only worth about $94,000 to me due to 86.58% inflation, compared to Bob's $300,000 at full value), we only have 2 rounds left. The risk of getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement is becoming too high. Given Bob's message that this is his final offer and the severe inflation penalty I'm facing, it's better to accept this offer than risk getting nothing."
