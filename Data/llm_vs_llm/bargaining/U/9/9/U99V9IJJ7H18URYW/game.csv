60.0,40.0,I suggest a fair 60-40 split. This gives you a good portion while acknowledging my first-mover position.,Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'd prefer a split more in my favor. Since money loses value more quickly for you (10% vs my 5% per round), we both benefit from agreeing soon. I'm suggesting I get $55 and you get $45. This is fair considering the time depreciation factors, and we'll both walk away with substantial value.",Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"Bob, I'm meeting you in the middle between our previous offers. With my higher inflation rate, this split is actually quite favorable to you - if we delay further, we both lose value. Let's agree now and both walk away with good value.",Alice,3,
