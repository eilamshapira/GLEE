"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'd prefer a split more in my favor. Since money loses value more quickly for you (10% vs my 5% per round), we both benefit from agreeing soon. I'm suggesting I get $55 and you get $45. This is fair considering the time depreciation factors, and we'll both walk away with substantial value. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Let me explain my reasoning: Even with the 10% inflation for my share vs 5% for Bob's share, I can still propose a better split for myself in the next round. After just one round of inflation, I would get $45 * 0.9 = $40.50, which is significantly less than my initial proposal. I'll make a new proposal in the next round that takes into account our different inflation rates but still maintains a better position for me."
