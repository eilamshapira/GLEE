"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a fair 60-40 split. This gives you a good portion while acknowledging my first-mover position. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $40 while she gets $60. However, since money loses value each round (5% for me, 10% for Alice), there's an incentive to reach an agreement sooner rather than later.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value will already be slightly diminished. Also, Alice faces a steeper depreciation rate (10% vs my 5%), which gives me some negotiating leverage in later rounds.

While a 50-50 split might seem ""fairer"" in absolute terms, Alice does have the first-mover advantage. Given the depreciation factors and that we have a limited number of rounds, this isn't a terrible initial offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more favorable to me while acknowledging the declining value of money for both of us, especially for Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'd prefer a split more in my favor. Since money loses value more quickly for you (10% vs my 5% per round), we both benefit from agreeing soon. I'm suggesting I get $55 and you get $45. This is fair considering the time depreciation factors, and we'll both walk away with substantial value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm meeting you in the middle between our previous offers. With my higher inflation rate, this split is actually quite favorable to you - if we delay further, we both lose value. Let's agree now and both walk away with good value. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's new offer. She's now proposing I get $45 while she gets $55, which is a halfway point between our previous positions.

Important considerations:
- Money is now worth 9.75% less for me than in round 1
- Money is worth 19% less for Alice than in round 1
- Alice's inflation rate (10% per round) is twice mine (5% per round)
- We have 9 rounds remaining, but the value continues to diminish

Alice makes a valid point about her higher inflation rate making this more favorable to me over time. If we continue negotiating for several more rounds, the total pie will shrink significantly.

This offer seems reasonable given the circumstances and the diminishing returns of prolonged negotiation.
