"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 531441 
# Alice gain: 468559 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Total amount: $1,000,000
2. My offered share: $531,441 (53.1%)
3. Alice's share: $468,559 (46.9%)
4. If I reject, next round will have 10% inflation for me, meaning the money will be worth less

This is actually a pretty fair offer. While I could make a counter-offer in the next round, I would lose 10% value, meaning $531,441 now is worth more than even a larger nominal amount in the next round.

Since the split is reasonably equitable (I'm getting slightly more than half) and avoiding inflation is important, I should accept this offer.
