"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair initial offer, considering that Bob faces steeper inflation (20%) than I do (5%). This should incentivize him to accept early.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable split that gives Bob a significant portion while acknowledging that I'm making the first move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. My $45 with 5% inflation = $42.75 real value
2. If I reject and we continue to round 3, all values will decrease further
3. Bob is offering a relatively fair split (45-55)
4. Bob faces steeper inflation (20%), so they have more incentive to reach a deal soon
5. I still have bargaining power in later rounds, but the total value keeps decreasing

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept this offer. While it's slightly less favorable than my initial proposal, the inflation impact makes it better to secure a deal now rather than risk further depreciation of the total amount."
