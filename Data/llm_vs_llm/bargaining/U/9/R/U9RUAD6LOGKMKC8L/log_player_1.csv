"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my first offer to Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose a 50-50 split of the money. This is a fair and equitable division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to consider the inflation factor now.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose that I receive $6,000 and Bob receives $4,000. With 20% inflation per round, this actually gives us closer to equal value - the $6,000 for me is worth less due to inflation, while Bob's $4,000 maintains its full value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
