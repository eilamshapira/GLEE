"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a fair offer considering the different inflation rates affecting us.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob! Since you'll be affected by a higher inflation rate (20%) than me (5%) if we delay, it makes sense to agree now. I'm offering you a substantial portion that acknowledges our different situations while being fair to both of us.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, given the higher inflation rate affecting me, I believe a 50-50 split is fair at this point. It balances out our different inflation rates and ensures we both get a reasonable share before the value decreases further for me. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
