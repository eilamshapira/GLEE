"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Since you'll be affected by a higher inflation rate (20%) than me (5%) if we delay, it makes sense to agree now. I'm offering you a substantial portion that acknowledges our different situations while being fair to both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, given the higher inflation rate affecting me, I believe a 50-50 split is fair at this point. It balances out our different inflation rates and ensures we both get a reasonable share before the value decreases further for me. What do you think?""
