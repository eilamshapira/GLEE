"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it evenly, fair for both 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering an even 50-50 split, which would give me $5,000. This is a perfectly fair offer, and since there's no inflation affecting my share in future rounds, I don't gain any advantage by rejecting and making a counter-offer. Also, there's no guarantee that Alice would accept a more favorable split if I proposed one in the next round.
