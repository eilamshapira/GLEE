"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, offering slightly more to Bob to encourage acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 480000, ""bob_gain"": 520000}

I propose this division where Bob gets $520,000 and I get $480,000. This is a reasonable split that gives Bob a slight advantage while still ensuring I receive a substantial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept:
   * I get $450,000 (worth full value)
   * Bob gets $550,000 (worth $522,500 due to 5% inflation)

2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make another offer
   * But Bob's portion will be worth even less due to inflation
   * However, I risk getting an even lower offer from Bob in future rounds

The current offer gives me 45% of the total value, which is slightly less than my initial proposal. However, it's still a substantial amount, and rejecting might lead to a more unfavorable situation in later rounds.
