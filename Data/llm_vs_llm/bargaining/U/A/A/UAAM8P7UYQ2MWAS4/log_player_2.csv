"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Alice in each round, I'll take that into account for my offer.

The total value of the money is now:
For me: $100 * 0.9 = $90
For Alice: $100 * 0.8 = $80

I'll make an offer that is favorable to me, but still reasonable for Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual values are:
For me: $50 * 0.81 (1 - 0.19) = $40.50
For Alice: $50 * 0.64 (1 - 0.36) = $32

Since the offer gives me $40.50 and Alice $32, which seems reasonable given the inflation, I'll accept the offer.
