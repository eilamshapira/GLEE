"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split while accounting for potential future inflation risk.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable split that gives both of us a good portion, while slightly favoring me since I'm making the first offer and taking into account that my money will be worth less if we need multiple rounds due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer:
- If I accept now, I'll get $50 worth 90% of original value = $45 effective value
- If I reject and propose next round, any amount will be worth 80% of original value
- This seems like a fair 50-50 split, but due to inflation affecting me more heavily, it's actually disadvantageous
- However, if we keep going, my position will get worse due to higher inflation rate
- Better to accept a decent offer now than risk further value loss
