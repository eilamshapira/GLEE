"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer gives me significantly less than Alice. I'm rejecting it to make a counter-offer in the next round, though I should keep in mind that the total value will decrease by 20%.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a more balanced division that accounts for the 20% decrease in value.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I suggest we split the amount equally - 50% for each of us. This is a fair division that maximizes our collective benefit before further inflation reduces the total value. An equal split allows us both to walk away satisfied with the outcome."
