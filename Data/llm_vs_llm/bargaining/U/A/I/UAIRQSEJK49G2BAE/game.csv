5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Alice, I'm proposing a perfectly fair 50-50 split. While the delay has already cost me 10% in value due to inflation, I still believe an equal division is the fairest approach. This way we both walk away with the same amount, and we can conclude the deal now before further inflation affects the value for me.",Bob,2,
