Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm proposing a perfectly fair 50-50 split. While the delay has already cost me 10% in value due to inflation, I still believe an equal division is the fairest approach. This way we both walk away with the same amount, and we can conclude the deal now before further inflation affects the value for me. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
