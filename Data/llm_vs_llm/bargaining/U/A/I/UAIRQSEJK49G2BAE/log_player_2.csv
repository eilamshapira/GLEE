"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split the money fairly. I propose 5500 for me and 4500 for you. This is a generous offer considering potential inflation! Let me know what you think. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer isn't quite fair given that we're starting with an equal position. She's asking for 55% of the money while offering me 45%. Additionally, I need to consider that with 10% inflation per round for me, if I reject and make a counter-offer, the total value would be worth less.

However, the inflation only affects me, not necessarily Alice. If I reject, I could propose a more equitable split in the next round, but the total would be worth 9,000 to me due to inflation.

Given these considerations, I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I need to be strategic here. Since I'm facing 10% inflation per round, the $10,000 is now effectively worth $9,000 to me. I should propose a fair split while accounting for the inflation I've already experienced.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I'm proposing a perfectly fair 50-50 split. While the delay has already cost me 10% in value due to inflation, I still believe an equal division is the fairest approach. This way we both walk away with the same amount, and we can conclude the deal now before further inflation affects the value for me.""}"
