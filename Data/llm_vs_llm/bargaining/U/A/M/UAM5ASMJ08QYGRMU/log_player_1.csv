"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

My reasoning is that I'm accounting for the inflation that will affect me in future rounds. Offering Bob a solid 40% right away gives him a good incentive to accept."
