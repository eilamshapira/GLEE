"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share for both 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Alice is offering me $40 while keeping $60 for herself. While she claims it's a ""fair share,"" it's actually favoring her by $20. Since this is just the first round and there's no inflation effect on my side, I can afford to reject this and make a counter-proposal that's more equitable.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a truly fair split while maintaining a cooperative tone.

{
""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Let's do a perfectly equal split - fair for both of us""
}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle of my first offer and equal split 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this...

Alice has moved slightly from her initial 40/60 split to a 42/58 split. However, due to inflation, her 58% is actually worth less to her now (reduced by 9.75%). This means she's trying to compensate for her loss of value by maintaining a higher nominal amount.

While 42% isn't exactly equal, given that:
1. We've already used 3 rounds
2. The inflation is affecting Alice but not me
3. She's showing willingness to compromise by moving from 40 to 42
4. My $42 maintains full value while her $58 is depreciated

This might be a reasonable time to accept. If we continue negotiating, Alice's inflation penalty will increase, which might make her less likely to offer better terms.
