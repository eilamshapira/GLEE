"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split that gives both of us a good outcome, slightly favoring myself since I'm making the first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 5400, ""bob_gain"": 4600}

I propose this split because it's close to 50-50 while giving me a small advantage as the first mover. It's fair enough that Bob should accept it rather than risk the 10% inflation penalty by rejecting and counter-offering."
