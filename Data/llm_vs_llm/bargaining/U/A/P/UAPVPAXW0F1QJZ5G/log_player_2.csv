"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer...

This is a pretty uneven split (46% vs 54%). While it's not terribly unfair, I know that if I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round. However, I need to consider that the total amount will decrease by 10% if I reject.

If I reject, the $10,000 becomes $9,000 in the next round. Even if I then propose a more favorable split, we'll be dividing a smaller pie.

Current offer: $4,600 for me
If I reject: Next round total is $9,000, and even if I propose a 50-50 split, I'd get $4,500

Since I would actually get less in the next round even with a fairer split, I should accept this offer.
