"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly down the middle, Bob. 500000$ for you and 500000$ for me. It's a fair start, and we can end this game right now with no one losing out to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think through this strategically:

1. The offer is an equal 50-50 split
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 5% less for me in the next round
3. Even if I make a more aggressive offer next round, Alice might reject it
4. A fair split now guarantees me $500,000
5. If I reject, I risk getting less due to inflation or potential disagreement

Given that it's a fair offer and the risk of inflation eating into future gains, I'll accept.
