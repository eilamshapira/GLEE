"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an attractive offer to Bob while considering the inflation pressure on me.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm offering you a generous $480,000 which is close to a 50-50 split. Since I'm affected by 5% inflation per round, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement early. This is a fair offer that lets us both walk away with substantial amounts.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but I think we can both do better. Let's split it 52/48, with me taking the slightly larger share.  I think this is still a fair split that allows us both to maximize our gains.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
