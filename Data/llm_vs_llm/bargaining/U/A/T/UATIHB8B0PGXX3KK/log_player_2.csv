"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm offering you a generous $480000 which is close to a 50-50 split. Since I'm affected by 5% inflation per round, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement early. This is a fair offer that lets us both walk away with substantial amounts. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
