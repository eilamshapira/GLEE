"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $40 while she gets $60 of the $100. 

If I reject and move to the next round, the total value decreases by 20% for me, meaning the $100 would be worth only $80 to me. Even if I were to get all of that in the next round (which is unlikely since Alice would need to accept), I'd only get $80.

Getting $40 now is better than risking a situation where I might get less after the 20% devaluation. Additionally, Alice's devaluation is only 5%, so she has less pressure to accept a deal quickly.
