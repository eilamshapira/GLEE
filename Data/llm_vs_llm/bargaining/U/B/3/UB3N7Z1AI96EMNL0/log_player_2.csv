"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is proposing I get $40 and she gets $60. 

Given that inflation affects me at 10% per round and affects Alice at 20% per round, it might be strategic to make a counter-offer rather than accepting right away. If I reject, I'll be able to make my own proposal next round, though the total value will decrease.

Let me analyze:
- If I accept now, I get $40
- If I reject and propose next round, the $100 will be worth 10% less to me, so I'd be dividing $90 of value (from my perspective)

Since I can make my own proposal next round and Alice faces higher inflation pressure (20% per round), I think I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a proposal that accounts for both our inflation rates. Since Alice faces higher inflation (20% per round vs my 10%), she should be more eager to reach an agreement sooner rather than later.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Alice gets $45. This is fair considering the inflation pressure we both face, and it gives Alice a reasonable share while improving my position from her initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this new offer from Alice. She's now offering me $45 and taking $55 for herself.

Considering inflation:
- We're now in round 3
- My inflation penalty is 19% from round 1
- Alice's inflation penalty is 36% from round 1
- If I reject, we'll go to round 4, where my penalty would increase further

Alice has moved from her initial 40/60 split to a 45/55 split, which is a significant improvement for me. Given that she faces steeper inflation penalties than I do, but still didn't accept my previous 55/45 offer, I need to be pragmatic.

$45 now is better than potentially less later, especially considering the risk of continued rejection.
