"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which would give me $5,000. 

Given that inflation reduces the value by 20% each round for me, if I reject now and we continue to the next round, the total pot would effectively be worth only $8,000 to me. Even if I managed to get all of it in round 2, that would be less valuable than accepting $5,000 now.

Additionally, there's no guarantee I could secure a better deal in subsequent rounds, and if we fail to reach an agreement within 12 rounds, we both get nothing.

The even split is fair, and with inflation working against me, it's in my best interest to accept this reasonable offer now.
