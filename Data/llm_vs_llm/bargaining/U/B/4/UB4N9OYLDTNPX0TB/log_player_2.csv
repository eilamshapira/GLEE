"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $400,000 for me, $600,000 for Alice

2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make an offer
   * But my money will be worth 20% less
   * Alice's money will be worth 10% less
   * Which means a $500,000 offer to me next round would only be worth $400,000
   * And Alice would be more likely to reject as their offer value decreases less

3. The current 40/60 split isn't great, but:
   * It's a substantial amount
   * The inflation penalty makes future rounds less attractive
   * I risk getting a worse deal if Alice rejects my next offer

Given the asymmetric inflation rates that work against me more than Alice, I should probably take this decent offer now rather than risk a worse outcome later.
