"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think through this:

1. Alice is offering a 50-50 split ($500,000 each)
2. This is a perfectly fair division
3. If I reject:
   - I'll get to make a counter-offer next round
   - But there's no guarantee Alice will accept
   - The money retains its value for me (0% inflation)
   - I don't know Alice's inflation rate
4. $500,000 is a substantial amount

Given that this is a fair offer and there's uncertainty about future rounds, I should accept this offer. There's no clear advantage in rejecting it.
