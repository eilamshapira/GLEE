# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 10% less for Alice, I'll try to take advantage of that. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the fact that Alice's gain is worth 19% less, I think I can get a better deal. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice's offer is worth even less to her now (19% less than the original value), and mine is still worth the same, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself. Here it is:

{""bob_gain"": 580000, 
""alice_gain"": 420000}"
