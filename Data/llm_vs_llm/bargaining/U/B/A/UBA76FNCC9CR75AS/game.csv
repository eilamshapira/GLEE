4500.0,5500.0,"Hi Alice, thank you for your round one offer. Since it's now my turn to propose, I'd like to suggest a 55-45 split in my favor. This is a fair balance considering we both want to avoid further rounds and potential complications. Looking forward to wrapping this up quickly and amicably.",Bob,2,

4200.0,5800.0,"Alice, I understand your desire for a fair split, but we both know that every additional round erodes your share's real value. With your money devaluing by 19%, waiting could leave you with far less in effective terms. I'm offering a 58-42 split that secures your nominal gain now before the depreciation wears on it further. Let's settle this deal and avoid further losses on both sides.",Bob,4,

4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, I understand the hesitation, but every round makes your share's real value drop further. With the current inflation cutting your gains by about 34.39%, any delay hurts significantly. I'm offering a 6000-4000 split in my favor. Accepting now secures you 4000 in nominal terms, which is better than risking further devaluation in later rounds. Let's lock this down before it's too late.",Bob,6,
