With the current inflation cutting your gains by about 34.39%, any delay hurts significantly. I'm offering a 6000-4000 split in my favor. Accepting now secures you 4000 in nominal terms, which is better than risking further devaluation in later rounds. Let's lock this down before it's too late.""}"
