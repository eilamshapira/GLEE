"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $5128.21 and you receive $4871.79. Accepting now avoids any further 5% devaluation in future rounds and ensures both of us get the best out of this deal! 
# Bob gain: 4871.79 
# Alice gain: 5128.21 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether I should accept this offer, let's consider the potential outcomes of rejecting it and moving to the next round. If I reject this offer, in the next round, I will make a proposal. However, due to the 5% devaluation, the total amount available for division will decrease.

Initial amount: $10,000
Devaluation rate: 5%

After the first round devaluation (if I reject the offer), the amount left would be:
$10,000 * 0.95 = $9,500

Considering this, if I were to make a proposal in the next round that slightly favors me (to incentivize acceptance), I might propose a division close to but slightly better for me than Alice's initial offer, taking into account the reduced total.

However, given that Alice's initial offer is relatively close to a 50/50 split and considering the devaluation factor, it might be beneficial to accept this offer to avoid further reduction in the total amount due to inflation.

Given these considerations, my response is:
{""decision"": ""accept""}"
