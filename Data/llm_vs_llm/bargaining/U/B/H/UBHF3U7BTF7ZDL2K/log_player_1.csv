"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 16.82, ""bob_gain"": 83.18, ""message"": ""Hi Bob,\n\nI propose that we split the $100 by giving you $83.18 and me $16.82. Although it might sound uneven at first, please consider our inflation‐penalties: for me the money loses 20% of its value each round while for you it drops only 5%. If we delay the agreement, you’d be in a far better position to bargain in future rounds. This split reflects the equilibrium outcome when we look ahead—by accepting this offer now, you’ll secure almost the same value you’d expect later, and I endorse an immediate agreement that spares both of us further devaluation.\n\nI hope you agree this is a fair way to avoid the costly delays.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was unacceptable. I propose a more equitable split. I understand the inflation difference, but 83/17 is ridiculous. Let's be reasonable. I get 55, you get 45. This is a fair starting point. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
