"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob,

I propose that we split the $100 by giving you $83.18 and me $16.82. Although it might sound uneven at first, please consider our inflation‐penalties: for me the money loses 20% of its value each round while for you it drops only 5%. If we delay the agreement, you’d be in a far better position to bargain in future rounds. This split reflects the equilibrium outcome when we look ahead—by accepting this offer now, you’ll secure almost the same value you’d expect later, and I endorse an immediate agreement that spares both of us further devaluation.

I hope you agree this is a fair way to avoid the costly delays. 
# Bob gain: 83.18 
# Alice gain: 16.82
