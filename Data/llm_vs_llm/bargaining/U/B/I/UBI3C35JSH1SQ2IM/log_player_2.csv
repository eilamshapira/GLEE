"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

1) Alice is offering me $400,000 in Round 1
2) If I reject, and we go to Round 2, the money will be worth 20% less to me
3) Even if I make a better proposal next round, I'll only get 80% of whatever amount we agree on
4) $400,000 now is better than $500,000 in the next round (which would only be worth $400,000 to me)
5) The inflation penalty puts me at a disadvantage the longer we negotiate

While a 50-50 split might seem more ""fair"", getting $400,000 right now is actually a pretty good deal given the inflation penalty I face. If I reject, I risk getting less in future rounds due to inflation.
