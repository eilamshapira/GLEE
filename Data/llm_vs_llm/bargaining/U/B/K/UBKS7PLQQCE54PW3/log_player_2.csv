"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take 60 and you take 40. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

If I reject and we go to the next round, Alice's money will be worth 20% less to her. So in the next round, I could offer a split that's better for me, and she might accept it since her money is devaluing.

60-40 is not a fair split in my favor, so I'll reject this and make a counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice's money is worth 20% less this round, I can leverage this to get a better deal. Her $60 from last round would now only be worth $48 to her. I'll propose a 70-30 split in my favor.

{""bob_gain"": 70,
""alice_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""Since the money is worth 20% less to you now, this $30 is still worth more than what you'd get if we keep going to the next round. Let's make a deal now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting us nowhere. Let's split it evenly and call it a day. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. A 50-50 split is being offered
2. For Alice, her $50 is actually only worth $32 (50 * 0.64) due to the 36% inflation
3. If I reject, we go to another round where her money will be worth even less
4. This gives me strong negotiating power for the next round
5. However, $50 is a significant improvement from her initial 40-60 split offer

Given that I can probably get an even better deal in the next round due to increasing inflation on Alice's side, I should reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice's money is now worth 49% less (20% + 20% + 20% compounded), if I offer her $40, it's only worth about $20 to her. If she rejects and we go another round, her money will be worth even less. This is a strong position for negotiation.

{""bob_gain"": 75,
""alice_gain"": 25,
""message"": ""Alice, due to the increasing inflation affecting your gains, this $25 now is actually worth more to you than $50 would be in the next round. This is the best deal you'll get - let's conclude this now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear you're trying to take advantage of the situation. This is my final offer.  If you reject it, we'll see what happens when the value diminishes even further for me. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation carefully:

1. Alice is offering me $55, which is better than any previous offer
2. Her $45 is only worth about $18.43 to her (45 * 0.4096 due to 59.04% inflation)
3. If I reject:
   - We go to another round where I can make an offer
   - But Alice seems determined and might continue rejecting
   - We could end up in a situation where both of us get nothing
4. $55 is actually a good deal for me, considering we started with a 40-60 offer
5. Alice's firm message suggests she might be willing to continue despite her losses

While I could try to push for more, there's a risk of losing everything. The $55 offer is substantial and guaranteed.
