"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
- Alice is offering me $4000 out of $10000 (40%)
- If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
- However, due to 10% inflation, the money will be worth less next round
- $4000 now is better than $4444 next round (which would be worth $4000 after 10% inflation)
- There's no guarantee Alice would accept a better offer from me
- This is a decent first offer, not too unfair
