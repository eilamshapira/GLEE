"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 100000, ""bob_gain"": 900000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, happy to start our negotiation. I propose that I receive $100,000 and you receive $900,000. Think about it: if you reject, you'll get to make an offer in round 2, but your money then will be reduced by 10% for that round. This split reflects your discounted future value and is fair by backward‐induction reasoning. I hope you agree—please accept this offer so that we can both walk away promptly.""}"
