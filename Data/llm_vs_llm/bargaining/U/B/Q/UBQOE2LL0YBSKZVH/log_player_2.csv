"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, happy to start our negotiation. I propose that I receive $100000 and you receive $900000. Think about it: if you reject, you'll get to make an offer in round 2, but your money then will be reduced by 10% for that round. This split reflects your discounted future value and is fair by backward‐induction reasoning. I hope you agree—please accept this offer so that we can both walk away promptly. 
# Bob gain: 900000 
# Alice gain: 100000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
