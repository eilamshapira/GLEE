"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Let's keep things fair and quick. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor due to the inflation disadvantage I face. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Alice's offer of a 55/45 split, where I would receive $450,000 and she would get $550,000.

Alice claims she faces an inflation disadvantage, but actually I'm the one who loses 5% value each round. If I reject this offer, I'll make a counter-offer next round, but the total money will be worth less to me.

This is a reasonable first offer. If I reject, I could propose something better for myself, but Alice might reject that, and we'd lose more rounds to inflation. A 45% share now is better than potentially less later after inflation effects.
