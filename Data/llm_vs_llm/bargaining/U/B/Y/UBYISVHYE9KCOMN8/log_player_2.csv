"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","While this offer gives me a substantial amount, considering the 20% inflation per round and the fact that I could potentially make a counter-offer, I believe I can get a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll offer a more balanced split that still accounts for the inflation pressure I'm facing.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing an equal 50-50 split of the money. This is fair for both of us, and since I'm facing 20% inflation per round, it's important that we reach an agreement soon. A fair split would benefit us both rather than continuing to negotiate while the value decreases."
