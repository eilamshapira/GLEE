"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","For the first round, I'll make a reasonable offer. Since I don't know how the inflation affects Bob, I'll start with a fair split to encourage acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept this offer, I'll get $300,000, but its value will be 5% less than its original value. So, the actual value I'll get is $300,000 * 0.95 = $285,000.

This offer seems quite low, and I think I can get a better deal in the next round. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me in each round, and this is the third round (considering the initial offer as round 1), the money I'll receive will be worth 10% less than its original value (5% less in round 2 and another 5% less in this round). 

To calculate the value I'll receive: $x * 0.95 * 0.95 = $x * 0.9025, where $x is the amount I propose for myself.

I'll aim for a split that takes into account the decreasing value for me but still tries to be reasonable for Bob. Let's propose a 55% to 45% split in my favor, considering the decreasing value.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, if I accept this offer, I'll get $350,000, but its value will be 14.26% less than its original value. So, the actual value I'll get is $350,000 * 0.8574 = $300,290.

This offer is slightly better than the previous one from Bob, but I still think I can negotiate a better deal. However, considering the increasing inflation effect on my potential gain, I should weigh the risk of waiting further.

For now, I'll reject this offer, hoping to get a more favorable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, the money I'll receive is now worth 19.01% less than its original value (5% less in each of the 4 rounds so far, compounded: 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.8094).

I'll aim for a more generous offer to Bob this time, trying to find a middle ground that considers the decreasing value of the money for me. Let's propose a 50% to 50% split, but since the value is decreasing for me, I'll actually offer slightly less than half to myself to account for the inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 480000, ""bob_gain"": 520000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, if I accept this offer, I'll get $400,000, but its value will be 22.62% less than its original value. So, the actual value I'll get is $400,000 * 0.7738 = $309,520.

This offer from Bob is better than his previous ones, and considering the significant inflation effect on my potential gain, I should carefully weigh the risks of waiting further. The value of the money I could potentially get is decreasing rapidly, and there are only 6 rounds left.

Given the current situation, I think this offer is reasonable, and it might be wise to accept it rather than risking further decreases in value.
