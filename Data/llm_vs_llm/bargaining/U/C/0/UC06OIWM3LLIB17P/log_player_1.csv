I propose a 900,000$ - 100,000$ split in my favor. This is a fair offer, considering the potential for inflation in future rounds.  Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm willing to compromise, but I won't settle for a 60/40 split. This offer is closer to Bob's previous proposal, but still reflects the value of the money being worth 20% less after inflation."
