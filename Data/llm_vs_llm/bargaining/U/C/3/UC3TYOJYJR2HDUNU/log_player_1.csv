"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 562000, ""bob_gain"": 438000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob! I suggest a split that's fair considering the inflation factor. Since each round makes the money worth 5% less to you, accepting now means you get the full value. This offer gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging that time favors me in negotiations.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the impact of inflation on me. However, I believe a slightly more balanced split is fair. This offer gives you a bit more but also considers my position. Let's settle this round to avoid further devaluation for me. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
