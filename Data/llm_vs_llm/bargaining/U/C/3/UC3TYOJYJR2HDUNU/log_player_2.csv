"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I suggest a split that's fair considering the inflation factor. Since each round makes the money worth 5% less to you, accepting now means you get the full value. This offer gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging that time favors me in negotiations. 
# Bob gain: 438000 
# Alice gain: 562000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
