"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the effective amount I'm dividing is $100 * 0.8 = $80. However, to make the offer, I'll still use the original $100 and consider the devaluation in my decision.

To make a fair offer, I'll consider the devaluation for both of us. For me, the money is worth 20% less, and for Alice, it's worth 10% less.

My offer:
{""bob_gain"": 45, 
""alice_gain"": 55}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the devaluation, the effective amount I would get is $42 * 0.64 (since 20% less in round 1 and another 20% less in round 2, which is 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64) = $26.88.

For Alice, the effective amount she would get is $58 * 0.81 (since 10% less in round 1 and another 10% less in round 2, which is 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81) = $46.98.

Given the significant devaluation for me and the fact that I still have several rounds to negotiate, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the devaluation, the money is now worth 40% less for me (20% less in round 1, 20% less in round 2, and I'll account for another 20% less in this round, which is 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.512) and 19% less for Alice in the first two rounds, and another 10% less in this round (0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.729).

My offer:
{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50}

This offer is more generous to Alice, considering the devaluation affects me more significantly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the devaluation, the effective amount I would get is $43 * 0.4096 (since 20% less in round 1, 20% less in round 2, 20% less in round 3, and 20% less in round 4, which is 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.4096) = $17.63.

For Alice, the effective amount she would get is $57 * 0.6561 (since 10% less in round 1, 10% less in round 2, 10% less in round 3, and 10% less in round 4, which is 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.6561) = $37.45.

Given the significant devaluation for me, I'll accept this offer as it seems more reasonable compared to the devalued amount I would get.
