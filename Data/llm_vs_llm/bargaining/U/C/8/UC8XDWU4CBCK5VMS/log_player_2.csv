"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer is 4000$ for me and 6000$ for Alice
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 20% inflation, if I wait:
   - Next round my share would need to be at least 5000$ to equal 4000$ in current value
   - Each further round makes it worse

While the split isn't 50-50, getting 4000$ now is better than risking further rounds with inflation eating into my share. If I reject, I'd need a much better deal next round just to break even.
