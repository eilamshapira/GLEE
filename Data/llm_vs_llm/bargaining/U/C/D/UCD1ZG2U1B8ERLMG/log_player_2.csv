"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice is offering me $40 while taking $60
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, my $40 would be worth $38 next round
4. There's no guarantee Alice would accept a better offer
5. $40 is a substantial portion and better than risking getting nothing
