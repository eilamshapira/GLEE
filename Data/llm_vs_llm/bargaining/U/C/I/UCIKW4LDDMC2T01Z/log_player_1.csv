"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to make an offer that is appealing enough for Bob to accept, considering the potential for inflation to erode my gains in later rounds.

Here's my first offer:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

Explanation: I am offering Bob $40, which is a significant portion of the money. I'm keeping $60 for myself. This should be enticing enough for him to accept, especially since he doesn't know how inflation will affect him."
