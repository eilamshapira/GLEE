"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. Alice is proposing I get $40 while she gets $60. While this isn't an even split, it's not terribly unfair either. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer, but there's no guarantee Alice will accept, and we don't know how inflation might affect her decisions.

Since $40 is a substantial portion of the total and I don't lose any value to inflation, I'll accept this offer. Getting $40 for sure is better than risking a longer negotiation that might end up worse for me.
