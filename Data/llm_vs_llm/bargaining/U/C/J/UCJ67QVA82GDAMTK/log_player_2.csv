Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concern about inflation. However, my earlier offer was already factoring that in. I'm slightly lowering my demand, hoping we can find common ground quickly. This gives me 57% and you 43%. Let's end this now! 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700
