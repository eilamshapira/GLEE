"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a slightly favorable split for me, considering Bob's money loses 5% value each round. If he declines, his share will be worth less in the next round.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose I get $60 and Bob gets $40. This is a reasonable offer considering the time pressure and inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Bob offers me $45 and takes $55
2. If I reject, we go to round 3 where:
   - I can make a new offer
   - Bob's money will be worth another 5% less
   - I have 10 more rounds before we both get nothing
3. While I could try to negotiate for more, this is actually a fair offer considering:
   - It's early in the game
   - The risk of getting nothing if we don't agree
   - Bob is already experiencing value loss
