Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I understand you're concerned about inflation, but my risk is higher in later rounds.  This offer is fair and ensures we both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
