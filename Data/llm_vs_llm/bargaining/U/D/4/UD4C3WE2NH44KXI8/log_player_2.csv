"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's make this quick and fair. I propose 60% for me and 40% for you. This way we both walk away with a good amount! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's offer carefully considering the inflation effect.

Alice is offering me 40% ($4,000) while taking 60% ($6,000). If I reject and we go to the next round, I'll face 10% inflation, meaning my potential earnings will be worth less. However, in the next round, I would get to make a counter-offer.

Given that each round reduces the value by 10% for me, and I don't know how inflation affects Alice, it seems reasonable to accept this initial offer. A 40% share now is better than risking further devaluation.
