600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get a substantial amount right away without risking inflation effects.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Alice, I think a 55-45 split is more reasonable, as we both have equal bargaining power and should share the amount more equally.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
700000.0,300000.0,"Bob, due to the 20% inflation penalty I'm experiencing each round, I need a larger nominal amount to achieve a fair effective split. My previous $600k would now only be worth $480k to me. This offer would give me an effective $560k after inflation, which is closer to a fair division.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
420000.0,580000.0,"Hi Alice, considering the inflation effect on your side, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to my previous offer. However, I still believe I should get a larger share since the money is worth the same to me.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
800000.0,200000.0,"Bob, let's be practical. With the 59% inflation I'll face next round, I need a higher nominal amount to get a fair share. This offer would give me an effective $328000 after inflation, while you get $200000. If we don't reach an agreement soon, we both risk getting nothing after 12 rounds. Please consider accepting this reasonable adjustment.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Hi Alice, I understand the inflation is affecting your side, but I'm not willing to accept an extremely uneven split. I'm willing to give you a smaller share, considering the inflation, but I still think I should get the larger portion.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
900000.0,100000.0,"Bob, we need to be realistic. With 73.8% inflation next round, even this seemingly uneven split would only give me an effective $235800 after inflation, while you get $100000. We're running out of rounds, and the inflation is making it impossible for me to accept smaller shares. This offer would give us both a meaningful amount - let's end this now before we both get nothing.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"Hi Alice, I understand the inflation is severely impacting your side, but I'm not willing to accept an extremely small share. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to my previous offer, but I still think I should get the larger portion. We're running out of rounds, and I'm willing to take the risk of getting nothing if I don't get a fair share.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
950000.0,50000.0,"Bob, we have only 3 rounds left after this. With 83.2% inflation next round, even this 95-5 split would only give me $159600 in effective value while you get $50000. If we don't reach an agreement soon, we BOTH get NOTHING. This is our best chance to both walk away with something meaningful. Please be rational and accept this offer.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"Hi Alice, I understand the urgency and the impact of inflation on your side, but I'm not willing to accept a tiny share. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to my previous offer, but I still think I should get the larger portion. With only 2 rounds left, I'm willing to take the risk of getting nothing if I don't get a fair share. If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'm prepared to walk away with nothing.",Bob,10,
