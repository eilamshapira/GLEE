Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think a 55-45 split is more reasonable, as we both have equal bargaining power and should share the amount more equally. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The inflation penalty means I would only effectively get $360,000 (80% of $450,000), while Bob gets $550,000. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round that better accounts for the inflation effect I'm experiencing."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation effect on your side, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to my previous offer. However, I still believe I should get a larger share since the money is worth the same to me. 
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

With the 48.8% inflation penalty, I would only effectively get $215,040 (51.2% of $420,000), while Bob gets $580,000. This is becoming very unbalanced. I need to make a stronger case in my next offer to account for the rapidly increasing inflation effect."

""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical. With the 59% inflation I'll face next round, I need a higher nominal amount to get a fair share. This offer would give me an effective $328,000 after inflation, while you get $200,000. If we don't reach an agreement soon, we both risk getting nothing after 12 rounds. Please consider accepting this reasonable adjustment.""

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the inflation is affecting your side, but I'm not willing to accept an extremely uneven split. I'm willing to give you a smaller share, considering the inflation, but I still think I should get the larger portion. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

With the 67.23% inflation penalty, I would only effectively get $130,880 (32.77% of $400,000), while Bob gets $600,000. This is extremely unbalanced, as I'm getting less than a quarter of what Bob gets in effective value. We're halfway through our rounds, and the inflation is severely impacting my position. I need to try another offer."

This offer would give us both a meaningful amount - let's end this now before we both get nothing.""

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to my previous offer, but I still think I should get the larger portion.

# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

With the 79.03% inflation penalty, I would only effectively get $73,355 (20.97% of $350,000), while Bob gets $650,000. This is extremely unbalanced - I'm getting about 1/9 of what Bob gets in effective value. With 4 rounds left and inflation getting worse, I need to try another offer, even though we're both risking getting nothing."

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the urgency and the impact of inflation on your side, but I'm not willing to accept a tiny share. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to my previous offer, but I still think I should get the larger portion. With only 2 rounds left, I'm willing to take the risk of getting nothing if I don't get a fair share. If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'm prepared to walk away with nothing. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

While this is a very unfavorable deal for me (I'll only get $40,260 in effective value after 86.58% inflation, while Bob gets $700,000), we only have 2 rounds left. Given Bob's message indicating he's willing to risk getting nothing, and the fact that my effective value will be even worse in the next rounds due to increasing inflation, it's better to accept something rather than risk getting nothing at all. This is a case where a small something is better than nothing."
