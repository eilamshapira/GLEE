Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, due to the 20% inflation penalty I'm experiencing each round, I need a larger nominal amount to achieve a fair effective split. My previous $600k would now only be worth $480k to me. This offer would give me an effective $560k after inflation, which is closer to a fair division.

Round 5

# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical. With the 59% inflation I'll face next round, I need a higher nominal amount to get a fair share. This offer would give me an effective $328000 after inflation, while you get $200000. If we don't reach an agreement soon, we both risk getting nothing after 12 rounds. Please consider accepting this reasonable adjustment.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we need to be realistic. With 73.8% inflation next round, even this seemingly uneven split would only give me an effective $235800 after inflation, while you get $100000. We're running out of rounds, and the inflation is making it impossible for me to accept smaller shares. This offer would give us both a meaningful amount - let's end this now before we both get nothing.
