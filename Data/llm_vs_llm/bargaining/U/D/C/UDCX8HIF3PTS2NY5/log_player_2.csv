Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 55/45. This is a fair offer, and we both walk away with a significant amount of money. It's better to accept now than risk losing value to inflation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the money is losing value quickly. I'm increasing my offer slightly, but I still think this is a reasonable split considering the time we've wasted. Let's take this deal before inflation hurts us both more. 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer has improved slightly, it's still not a fair deal. Accepting this offer would mean I lose out on a significant amount of the potential gain, even considering inflation. I'm willing to take a calculated risk and counter-offer in the next round."
