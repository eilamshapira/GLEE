"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice is offering me 4000$ out of 10,000$
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 20% inflation, if I wait until next round, any amount I get will be worth 20% less to me
4. If I reject now, 4000$ in the next round would only be worth 3200$ to me

While 4000$ is less than half, waiting would reduce my purchasing power significantly. Making a counter-offer might not lead to a better outcome considering the inflation penalty.
