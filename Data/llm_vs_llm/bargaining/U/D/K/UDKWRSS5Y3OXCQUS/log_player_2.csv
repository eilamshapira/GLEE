"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we both win. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I should carefully consider this first offer. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which is objectively fair. While I could reject and make a counter-offer to try getting more, I need to consider:

1. The 20% inflation penalty per round makes the total amount smaller if we delay
2. Alice made a reasonable and fair opening offer
3. There's no guarantee I could get a better deal in later rounds
4. $500,000 is a substantial amount

Given these factors, accepting this fair offer now is better than risking value loss through inflation and potential deadlock.
