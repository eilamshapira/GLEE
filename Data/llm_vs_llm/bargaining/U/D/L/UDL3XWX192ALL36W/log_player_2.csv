Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think 60/40 is a fair deal.  Let's end this. 
# Bob gain: 400000

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is a tough one, as the value is decreasing. However, getting less than half the pot when I have the chance to make proposals for the rest of the game is a bad position to be in. I'm hoping Alice will be more open to a more even split as the rounds progress and the risk of getting nothing increases."
