"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable split that gives both of us a substantial amount, while accounting for my first-mover position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer:
1. Due to 5% inflation, the real value of my $45 is actually $42.75
2. If I reject and we go to round 3, there will be another 5% inflation
3. Bob's counter-offer is essentially a mirror of my initial offer
4. Further negotiation might lead to worse outcomes for both due to continued inflation

While I could try to negotiate for more, the inflation penalty makes accepting this offer the more rational choice.
