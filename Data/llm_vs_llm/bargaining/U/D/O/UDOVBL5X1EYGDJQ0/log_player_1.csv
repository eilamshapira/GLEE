"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Here's a fair offer, Bob. I propose we split the amount so I receive $600,000 and you receive $400,000. Accepting early can save us both from the impact of inflation in the next rounds.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the impact of inflation, I propose a split where I receive $550000 and you receive $450000. This is a fair adjustment given the reduced value of money in this round. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
