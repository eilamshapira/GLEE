"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm taking the initiative in making the first offer. This is a fair deal considering we both need to reach an agreement.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's split the amount equally at $5000 each. This way, we ensure a fair deal for both of us from the beginning. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer of a 50-50 split. While I could try to negotiate for more, there's risk in prolonging the negotiation, and $5000 is a fair amount. Even though Bob's share is worth 20% less to him now due to inflation, this doesn't affect my gain, and the equal split is reasonable."
