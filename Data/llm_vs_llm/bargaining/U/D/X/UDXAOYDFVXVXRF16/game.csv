5556.0,4444.0,"Hi Bob, I'd like to propose a division that gives me $5556 and you $4444. This split is designed so that you receive exactly what you'd expect to secure in the next round (adjusted for the 20% devaluation), ensuring maximum efficiency and fairness if you accept now. I look forward to your agreement.",Alice,1,
