"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'd like to propose a division that gives me $5556 and you $4444. This split is designed so that you receive exactly what you'd expect to secure in the next round (adjusted for the 20% devaluation), ensuring maximum efficiency and fairness if you accept now. I look forward to your agreement. 
# Bob gain: 4444 
# Alice gain: 5556 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine if I should accept this offer, let's calculate what I would expect to get in the next round if I were to propose, considering the 20% devaluation.

Initial amount: $10,000
After 1 round (20% devaluation): $10,000 * 0.8 = $8,000

If I were to propose in the next round, to be fair and mirror Alice's strategy, I would aim to give Alice what she would get if she accepted my proposal in the subsequent round, adjusted for another 20% devaluation.

However, Alice's proposal gives me $4,444 directly. Let's see what I would get if I rejected this offer and proposed in the next round, aiming for a similar ""fair"" split after devaluation.

After rejecting this offer, the total amount devalues to $8,000. If I then propose a split that mirrors Alice's logic (giving her what she'd expect in the next round after another devaluation), I'd consider the amount after another devaluation:

$8,000 * 0.8 = $6,400 (amount after another round of devaluation)

If I were to give Alice the same proportion she initially offered me (which is 44.44% of the devalued amount, as $4,444 is 44.44% of $10,000), I would calculate my share based on the devalued $8,000, not directly using Alice's initial percentages.

But let's directly address Alice's claim: she says I'd get $4,444 in the next round if I accept now, adjusted for devaluation. This implies she's considering the devaluation in her offer. Given the structure of her argument, it seems she's trying to convince me that $4,444 now is equivalent to what I'd negotiate for in the next round, considering the devaluation.

Given this, and without complex further devaluation calculations for subsequent rounds which would further reduce the total amount, I should consider whether $4,444 now is better than the potential for more after devaluation.

Considering the devaluation and the potential risks of further negotiation, I think it's reasonable to accept this offer, as it provides a clear, upfront value without the risk of further devaluation.
