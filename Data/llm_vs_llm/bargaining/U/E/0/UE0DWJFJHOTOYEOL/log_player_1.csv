"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair since you face 10% inflation per round - if you reject, your share will be worth less next time.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fairer split considering my inflation disadvantage. If you reject, I might accept any offer next round due to increased inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Bob's current offer gives me $5500
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
   - Bob will face another 10% inflation
   - I could potentially get more, but Bob might be less likely to accept
   - There's risk in continuing

The current offer is reasonable - I get more than half, and continuing the game risks both of us getting less value overall due to Bob's inflation penalty.
