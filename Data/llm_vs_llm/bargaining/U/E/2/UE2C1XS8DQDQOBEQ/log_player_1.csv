"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me think strategically about this. Since Bob's money loses 10% value each round and mine doesn't, Bob has an incentive to accept sooner rather than later. However, I don't want to be too aggressive in my first offer as that might lead to immediate rejection.

I'll propose a split where I get a bit more than half, but not too much to seem unfair:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

This gives Bob a substantial amount while still securing a good position for me. If Bob rejects this, their next counter-offer will be worth 10% less to them, which works in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. If I accept:
   * I get $400,000 (full value)
   * Bob gets $600,000 (but at 90% value = $540,000 effective value for Bob)

2. If I reject:
   * We go to next round where I can make an offer
   * Bob's money will be worth another 10% less (80% of original value)
   * My money maintains its value
   * I can potentially get a better deal

Given that Bob's money is already devalued and will continue to devalue, I have leverage to get a better deal. Bob's current effective gain ($540,000) is less than their nominal gain ($600,000), and this gap will widen in future rounds.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given the dynamics so far and the increasing inflation pressure on Bob's side:

1. Bob rejected my initial 600k/400k split
2. Bob's counter-offer showed they want more, but their bargaining power is weakening
3. Bob's money is now worth only 80% of the original value
4. I can be a bit more aggressive now, as time is on my side

I'll propose a split that gives me a larger share, as Bob should be more inclined to accept due to mounting inflation pressure:

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

Even though Bob would only get $300,000, at 80% value that's still $240,000 effective value for them. If they reject, their next counter-offer would be at 70% value, weakening their position further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. If I accept:
   * I get $500,000 (full value)
   * Bob gets $500,000 (but at 72.9% value ≈ $364,500 effective value for Bob)

2. If I reject:
   * We go to next round where I can make an offer
   * Bob's money will be worth another 10% less (about 63% of original value)
   * My money maintains its value
   * I can potentially get a better deal

Bob is offering me a better deal than before ($500k vs $400k), showing they're feeling the pressure of inflation. However, given that I have time on my side and Bob's money continues to devalue, I can likely get an even better deal by waiting.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let's analyze the situation:

1. Bob's money is now worth only about 63% of its original value
2. Bob has shown willingness to move towards a 50/50 split
3. However, their 50/50 split would actually be very unfavorable to them due to inflation
4. I can push for an even better deal as time pressure mounts

Given these factors, I'll propose an even more aggressive split:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}

The reasoning is:
- For me: I get $800,000 at full value
- For Bob: They get $200,000 at 63% value ≈ $126,000 effective value
- If they reject, their next counter-offer would be at even lower value (around 53% of original value)
- They should start feeling significant pressure to accept as their effective value continues to decrease"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. If I accept:
   * I get $600,000 (full value)
   * Bob gets $400,000 (but at 59.05% value ≈ $236,200 effective value for Bob)

2. If I reject:
   * We go to next round where I can make an offer
   * Bob's money will be worth another 10% less (about 49% of original value)
   * My money maintains its value
   * I can potentially get an even better deal

Bob has increased their offer to me again (from $500k to $600k), showing they're really feeling the pressure of inflation. They're clearly moving in my direction, but given that:
1. I still have several rounds left
2. Bob's money continues to devalue significantly
3. Bob has shown willingness to increase my share
4. I have all the leverage due to no inflation on my side

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Looking at the progression:

1. Bob's money is now worth only about 49% of original value
2. Bob has been steadily increasing my share (400k → 500k → 600k)
3. They've rejected my previous offers of 600k, 700k, and 800k
4. We're now more than halfway through the rounds
5. Both of us risk getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds

Given this, I'll maintain strong pressure but with a slightly more moderate offer than my last one:

{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}

Reasoning:
- For me: $750,000 at full value
- For Bob: $250,000 at 49% value ≈ $122,500 effective value
- This is a slight retreat from my previous 800k/200k offer
- But still maintains strong pressure as Bob's value continues to erode
- Shows some willingness to compromise while maintaining my strong position
- If Bob rejects, their next offer will be at ~39% value, making their position even weaker"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. If I accept:
   * I get $700,000 (full value)
   * Bob gets $300,000 (but at 47.83% value ≈ $143,490 effective value for Bob)

2. If I reject:
   * We go to next round where I can make an offer
   * Bob's money will be worth another 10% less (about 38% of original value)
   * My money maintains its value
   * But we're now in round 8 of 12

Bob has increased their offer again (from $600k to $700k), showing significant movement in my direction. While I could potentially get more by waiting, I need to consider:
1. We only have 4 rounds left
2. Bob has shown consistent willingness to increase my share
3. $700,000 is a very good outcome for me
4. Risk of getting nothing if we don't agree increases with each round

Given these factors, especially that this is a strong offer and we're running out of time:
