"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to split evenly, but I need a little extra to account for the inflation affecting my share more. How about a slightly better deal for me this time? 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll evaluate Bob's offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, the $4750 Bob offered is actually worth $4750 * 0.9 = $4275 to me.

I'll reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer.

The total amount is still $10,000, but due to inflation, the money I gain is worth 20% less (10% from Round 1 + 10% from Round 2), and the money Bob gains is worth 10% less (5% from Round 1 + 5% from Round 2).

To account for this, I'll offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Let's make a deal before inflation reduces our shares further. This offer gives me a bit more to compensate for the higher inflation rate on my share.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This offer acknowledges the inflation affecting both of us, while still providing me with a slightly larger share to compensate for my higher losses as the rounds progress. Let's compromise and secure a decent amount before it's too late. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection from Bob.

Now, let's evaluate his new offer. Considering the inflation, the $4900 Bob offered is actually worth $4900 * 0.729 (1 - 0.271) = $3572.1 to me.

I'll think about it... Since the inflation is eating away at our shares, it might be wise to accept an offer that gives me a decent amount, even if it's not exactly what I wanted.
