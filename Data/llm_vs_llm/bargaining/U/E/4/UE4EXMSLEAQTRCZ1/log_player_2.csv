Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal before inflation reduces our shares further. This offer gives me a bit more to compensate for the higher inflation rate on my share. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Alice's offer acknowledges the inflation disparity, it still heavily favors her. I'm willing to negotiate, but not to the point where I'm losing a significant portion of the potential gains."
