Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{
    ""bob_gain"": 600000,
    ""alice_gain"": 400000
}
```
My reasoning:

* **Inflation:** I need to factor in the rapidly decreasing value of the money. Another round means a 5% loss for me and a 10% loss for Alice.
* **Alice's Round 1 Offer:** Alice started extremely aggressively (900,000 for herself). This suggests she's trying to maximize her take, and might be willing to go lower.
* **Strategy:** I'm offering a significantly better deal than Alice, but still keeping a slight majority. This gives her an incentive to accept, as rejecting would mean losing 10% of that 400,000 in the next round. If she rejects, I'll still have a decent amount to negotiate with in the next round, considering the inflation. 600,000 - (600,000 * 0.05) = 570,000 which is not great, but more than 100,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 190000 
# Alice gain: 810000

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{
    ""bob_gain"": 550000,
    ""alice_gain"": 450000
}
```

Reasoning:

* **Continued Inflation:** Inflation is hitting us both hard. The longer this goes, the less the money is worth.
* **Alice's Aggressiveness:** Alice is *still* offering me less than 200,000 despite two rounds of significant inflation. This is unreasonable.
* **My Approach:** I'm decreasing my demand slightly, but still offering a favorable split. This is because rejecting will mean losing another 5% for me and 10% for Alice. This should make my offer seem more attractive to her. I will need at least half of the value to be able to accept this offer."
