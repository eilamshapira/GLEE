45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, I think a more balanced split would be fair. Since you face higher inflation than I do (20% vs 10%), we both benefit from reaching an agreement soon, but this should be more equitable than the initial offer.",Bob,2,

48.0,52.0,"Alice, considering we're now in round 4 with significant inflation impacts (19% for me, 36% for you), we should reach an agreement quickly. This offer is nearly balanced and recognizes that additional delays hurt both of us, but especially you with your higher inflation rate. Let's settle now and both walk away with a fair deal.",Bob,4,
