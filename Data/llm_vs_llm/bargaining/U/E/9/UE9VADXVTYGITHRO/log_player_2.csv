"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. This gives us a good head start against inflation. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $35 while she gets $65. If I reject, I'll make a counter-offer in round 2, but we'll both face inflation - 10% for me and 20% for Alice.

Let me think about this strategically. If I reject, the $100 becomes worth $90 to me and $80 to Alice in the next round. This gives me leverage to potentially get a better deal, as Alice faces steeper inflation.

Given that we have 12 rounds and inflation compounds each round, it makes sense to negotiate rather than accept this first offer which strongly favors Alice.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I should make a reasonable counter-offer that acknowledges our different inflation rates while being fair enough that Alice might accept.

Since Alice faces higher inflation (20% per round vs my 10%), she has more incentive to reach an agreement quickly. However, I don't want to be too aggressive as that might lead to prolonged negotiations where we both lose.

A more balanced split would be appropriate, perhaps slightly in my favor given the inflation asymmetry.

{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I think a more balanced split would be fair. Since you face higher inflation than I do (20% vs 10%), we both benefit from reaching an agreement soon, but this should be more equitable than the initial offer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's try to find a compromise. This offer is more balanced while acknowledging the impact of inflation on my end. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer considering the inflation effects.

Alice has improved her offer from $35 to $40 for me, while reducing her share from $65 to $60. However, we've already gone through two rounds, so inflation has reduced the value significantly.

The $40 offer is now worth $40 × (1 - 0.19) = $32.40 in round 1 terms for me.
Alice's $60 is worth $60 × (1 - 0.36) = $38.40 in round 1 terms for her.

If I reject and we go to round 4, inflation will reduce values further. Since Alice faces higher inflation, she has more incentive to settle, but her current offer still favors her substantially.

I think there's room for a more balanced agreement, especially given the asymmetric inflation impacts.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I need to make a strategic offer that considers our current inflation levels and creates an incentive for Alice to accept.

At this point, we're facing significant inflation effects (19% for me, 36% for Alice). If we continue negotiating, both of us will lose more value. Since Alice faces higher inflation (20% per round vs my 10%), finding an agreement now is especially beneficial for her.

Let me propose a fair split that acknowledges this reality:

{""bob_gain"": 52, 
""alice_gain"": 48,
""message"": ""Alice, considering we're now in round 4 with significant inflation impacts (19% for me, 36% for you), we should reach an agreement quickly. This offer is nearly balanced and recognizes that additional delays hurt both of us, but especially you with your higher inflation rate. Let's settle now and both walk away with a fair deal.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your emphasis on fairness.  This offer reflects that shared value while accounting for the reality of the inflation rates. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's latest offer considering our current inflation levels.

At this point:
- My inflation is 34.39%, meaning $1 is now worth about $0.66 to me compared to round 1
- Alice's inflation is 59.04%, meaning $1 is now worth about $0.41 to her compared to round 1

Alice's offer of $43 to me is worth $43 × (1 - 0.3439) = $28.21 in round 1 terms.
Her $57 is worth $57 × (1 - 0.5904) = $23.35 in round 1 terms.

She has improved her offer from $40 to $43, which shows movement in my direction. Given the significant inflation we're both facing (especially Alice), continuing to negotiate will substantially reduce the value for both of us. Her higher inflation rate (20% vs my 10%) means she's losing value faster, which explains her willingness to improve the offer.

While I could push for slightly more, the risk of further value erosion makes accepting this offer reasonable.
