"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice offers me $40, keeping $60 for herself
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 10% inflation per round, my $40 would be worth $36 next round
4. I could try to negotiate for more, but the inflation penalty means I need a significantly better offer to make it worthwhile

Given that:
- The offer is not terrible (40/60 split)
- Inflation will eat into my gains if I delay
- There's no guarantee Alice will accept a better offer
- The risk of getting nothing if we can't agree in 12 rounds
