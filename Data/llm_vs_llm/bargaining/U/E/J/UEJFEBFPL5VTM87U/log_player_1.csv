"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a slightly higher share for me at $550,000 with $450,000 for you. This is fair considering the 10% inflation penalty I face with each round, which means waiting is more costly for me. Let's agree now so we both walk away with a substantial amount.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose a more balanced share for each of us: $400000 for me and $600000 for you. This way, we both benefit while acknowledging that the value decreases with each round. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
