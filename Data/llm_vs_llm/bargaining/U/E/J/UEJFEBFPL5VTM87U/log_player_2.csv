"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a slightly higher share for me at $550000 with $450000 for you. This is fair considering the 10% inflation penalty I face with each round, which means waiting is more costly for me. Let's agree now so we both walk away with a substantial amount. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
