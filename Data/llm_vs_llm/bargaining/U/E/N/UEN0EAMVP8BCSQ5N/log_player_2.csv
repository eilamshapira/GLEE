"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. Since I face 20% inflation each round, waiting is costly for me. This is a fair offer that gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging my time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully.

Alice is offering me 4000$ out of 10,000$, which is 40% of the total. She claims she also faces 20% inflation per round, but I don't know if that's true - the rules state I don't know how inflation affects Alice.

If I reject and make a counter-offer, the total value to me decreases by 20%. So the 10,000$ would be worth 8,000$ to me in the next round. If I ask for 50% in the next round, that would be 4,000$ (in original value terms), the same as I'm being offered now.

Since Alice's current offer gives me the same value I could reasonably expect from making a counter-offer, and there's risk in continuing, I'll accept.
