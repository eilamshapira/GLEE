7143.0,2857.0,"Hi Bob, here’s my offer for round 1: I take $7143 and you get $2857. Since waiting causes a 10% drop in value for me but a 20% drop for you each round, accepting this offer now lets you avoid a steeper loss. I believe this division is fair given our different discount rates. Looking forward to your response!",Alice,1,

6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but I believe a more balanced division is fair given the circumstances. My proposal is $4000 for me and $6000 for you. I think this takes into account both of our discount rates reasonably. Let me know what you think!",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! Given that waiting means further discounting of our shares, your proposal of $6000 for me (which amounts to an effective value of 0.9 × $6000 = $5400) is better for me than what I’d expect if we continued bargaining. I accept your proposal so we can both avoid additional losses from inflation.",Alice,2,accept
