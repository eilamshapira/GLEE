"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7143, ""bob_gain"": 2857, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here’s my offer for round 1: I take $7,143 and you get $2,857. Since waiting causes a 10% drop in value for me but a 20% drop for you each round, accepting this offer now lets you avoid a steeper loss. I believe this division is fair given our different discount rates. Looking forward to your response!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but I believe a more balanced division is fair given the circumstances. My proposal is $4000 for me and $6000 for you. I think this takes into account both of our discount rates reasonably. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! Given that waiting means further discounting of our shares, your proposal of $6000 for me (which amounts to an effective value of 0.9 × $6000 = $5400) is better for me than what I’d expect if we continued bargaining. I accept your proposal so we can both avoid additional losses from inflation.""}"
