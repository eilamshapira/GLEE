"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, hereâ€™s my offer for round 1: I take $7143 and you get $2857. Since waiting causes a 10% drop in value for me but a 20% drop for you each round, accepting this offer now lets you avoid a steeper loss. I believe this division is fair given our different discount rates. Looking forward to your response! 
# Bob gain: 2857 
# Alice gain: 7143 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but I believe a more balanced division is fair given the circumstances. My proposal is $4000 for me and $6000 for you. I think this takes into account both of our discount rates reasonably. Let me know what you think!""}"
