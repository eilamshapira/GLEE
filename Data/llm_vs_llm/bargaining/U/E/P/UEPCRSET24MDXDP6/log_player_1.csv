"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I want to start with a fair offer, considering the inflation.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

My reasoning: I'm offering slightly more than half to myself to account for the future rounds where Bob might demand more, and the inflation will be hurting me. This seems like a reasonable starting point that Bob might accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the inflation and the remaining rounds. Accepting Bob's offer means I get $5000, which is worth 5% less than it would have been in round 1.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Reasoning: A 50/50 split is fair. While the inflation hurts, the risk of further rounds and potential rejections outweigh the loss from inflation. Accepting now guarantees $5000 (albeit slightly devalued), whereas rejecting could lead to a worse outcome in future rounds. It is better to be safe than sorry."
