"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing to give me $4,500 out of the $10,000, while she takes $5,500. If I reject this, I can make a counteroffer in the next round, but I need to remember that inflation will reduce the value of the money by 5% for me.

Let me evaluate: If I reject, the $10,000 will be worth 5% less to me next round, so the total would be worth $9,500 to me. I would need to get more than $4,500 out of that $9,500 to make rejection worthwhile.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a counterproposal that accounts for the inflation effect while trying to be fair.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an equal split of the money, which I believe is fair for both of us. While I've experienced 5% inflation, making an even 50-50 split is a standard fair division that should be acceptable to Alice."
