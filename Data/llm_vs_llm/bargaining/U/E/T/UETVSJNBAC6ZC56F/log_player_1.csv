"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to propose a more even split.  Since the money devalues faster for me, I'll take a slightly smaller share to ensure we both get a decent amount and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
