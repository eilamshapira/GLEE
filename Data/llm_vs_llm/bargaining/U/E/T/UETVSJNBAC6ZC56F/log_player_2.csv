"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, since the money will devalue more for you in the next rounds, I believe a fair start would be me getting $6000 and you $4000. It ensures we both get a good amount right away. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'd like to propose a more even split.  Since the money devalues faster for me, I'll take a slightly smaller share to ensure we both get a decent amount and avoid further losses.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering the devaluation rate affecting you, I'll propose $5500 for myself and $4500 for you this round. It balances out with the devaluation and gives us both a timely resolution. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
