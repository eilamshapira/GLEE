"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money evenly to be fair. If we keep going back and forth with counter-offers, inflation will reduce our total value, so an equal split gives us both the most money. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
