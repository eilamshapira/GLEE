"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Even with inflation, accepting $3500 is a bad deal for me. If the game goes to the final round, I can propose to keep everything and Alice would have no choice but to accept."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}
``` 

This is a risky move, as it assumes Alice will want to avoid reaching the final round where she gets nothing. However, it's the best chance to maximize my gains before inflation further devalues the money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough decision, but with the current inflation rate, waiting another round is too risky. Accepting $3,000 is better than risking getting nothing at all if Alice plays aggressively."
