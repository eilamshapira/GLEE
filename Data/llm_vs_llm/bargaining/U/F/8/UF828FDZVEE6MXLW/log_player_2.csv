"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's settle immediately. I propose $55 for me and $45 for you. I believe this division fairly reflects the cost of delay for me due to inflation. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me $45 out of $100, keeping $55 for herself. While this isn't an equal split, it's a reasonably fair offer. Since I know I don't face any inflation penalty in future rounds, I could reject and counter-offer, but:

1. Alice's offer is already quite reasonable (45%)
2. Prolonging negotiations might make Alice less cooperative
3. There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the next round
4. Getting $45 now is a certain outcome

Given these factors, I'll accept this offer.
