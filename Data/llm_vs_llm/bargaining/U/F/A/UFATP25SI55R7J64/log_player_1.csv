"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, considering that I need to make it attractive enough for Bob to accept, while accounting for the 20% inflation penalty I'll suffer if we go to the next round.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split where I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000. This is a reasonable offer that gives Bob a substantial amount while acknowledging that I made the first move and face inflation risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 20% inflation, if I accept this offer:
* I would get $500,000, but it's worth only $400,000 to me (due to 20% inflation)
* Bob would get $500,000 (full value)

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round:
* The money will be worth another 20% less to me
* I might be able to get more nominal dollars, but they'll be worth even less
* There's no guarantee Bob will accept my next offer

Given that Bob's offer is fairly reasonable (50-50 split nominally), and considering the risk of further inflation, I should accept this offer.
