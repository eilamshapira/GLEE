"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. 
Alice has offered a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance.
However, if I reject, I can make my own offer next round.
The downside is that the money will be worth 20% less (800,000$ total).
Given that this is a perfectly fair offer and any delay would reduce the total value, I should accept.
