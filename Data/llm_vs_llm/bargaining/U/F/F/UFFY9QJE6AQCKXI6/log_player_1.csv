"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, considering that I need to account for the 10% inflation penalty I face in future rounds if we don't agree now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer because even with the 10% inflation penalty, I can still try to negotiate for a better deal. The current offer would only give me $40.50 in real value (45 * 0.9), which is significantly lower than what I proposed initially."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42}

I'm slightly lowering my initial offer to show willingness to compromise, but still maintaining a higher share to compensate for the 20% inflation penalty I now face (meaning my $58 is actually worth $46.40 to me)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer because with the 27.1% inflation penalty, the $42 would only be worth $30.62 to me (42 * 0.729), which is too low. Even with increasing inflation pressure, I believe we can reach a better agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm further lowering my offer to reach a compromise. With the current 34.4% inflation penalty (1 - 0.9^4), my $55 would actually be worth about $36.08 to me. I hope Bob recognizes this reasonable adjustment and accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept this offer because with the 40.95% inflation penalty, my $40 would be worth $23.62, and if we continue negotiating, the inflation penalty will keep growing. Also, we're already halfway through our rounds, and the risk of getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement is becoming more concerning. Better to secure some value now than risk further depreciation or total loss."
