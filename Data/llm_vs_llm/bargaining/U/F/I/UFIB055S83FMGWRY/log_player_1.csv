"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I want to make a fair offer to maximize my gains while also ensuring Bob accepts it, considering the diminishing value of the money with each passing round.

Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **Fairness:** This split is slightly in my favor, but not excessively so. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation.
*   **Bob's Perspective:** In the first round, Bob might be tempted to reject any offer that doesn't seem close to a 50/50 split. Offering him $4500 should be enticing enough, especially considering the immediate 10% loss he'd face if we moved to the next round.
*   **My Perspective:** I need to get a good deal early, while the money is worth more to me. I need to leave a little on the table so that Bob doesn't reject the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the situation. Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's making a counter-offer. I need to consider the inflation and how it affects the value of the money for both of us.

*   **Value for me:** $4500 in this round is worth 5% less than it would have been in the first round. So, it's equivalent to $4500 * 0.95 = $4275 (in round 1 dollars).
*   **Value for Bob:** $5500 in this round is worth 10% less to Bob than it would have been in the first round. So it's worth $5500 * 0.90 = $4950 (in round 1 dollars) for Bob.

Essentially, Bob's offer translated to round 1 dollars is me getting 4275 and Bob getting 4950.

Given the inflation, and considering we only have 12 rounds, I think it is in my best interest to accept this offer.
