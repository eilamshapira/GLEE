"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my first offer to Bob. I want to be fair but also consider the inflation affecting me each round.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an equal split of the $10,000, with each of us receiving $5,000. This is a fair division that respects both of our interests."
