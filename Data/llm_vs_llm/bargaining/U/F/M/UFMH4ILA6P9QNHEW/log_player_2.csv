"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. I'm offered $40 out of $100
2. If I reject, I can make my own offer next round
3. However, due to 20% inflation for me, next round the $100 will only be worth $80 for me
4. For Alice, it will be worth $95 due to 5% inflation
5. $40 now is better than a maximum of $80 next round which I'd have to split with Alice

While I could try to negotiate for more, the steep inflation rate for me (20%) makes accepting this reasonable offer the better choice.
