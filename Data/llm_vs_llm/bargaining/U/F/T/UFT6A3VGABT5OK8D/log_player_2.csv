"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the money 55/45. This is a fair offer, and hopefully we can both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer gives me $4,500
2. If I reject and we go to next round:
   - The total value will be worth 5% less to me ($9,500 total value)
   - Maximum I could propose would be around $9,500
   - But Alice might reject, leading to further rounds and more value loss

Alice's offer of 45% ($4,500) is fairly reasonable. While slightly in her favor, the risk of losing value through inflation and potential further negotiations makes accepting this offer the rational choice.
