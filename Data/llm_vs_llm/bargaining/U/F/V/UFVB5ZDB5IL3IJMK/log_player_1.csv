"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with an offer to divide the $10,000, keeping in mind that inflation will affect the value of my share if we delay:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I believe this is a fair initial offer that gives both of us a substantial portion. Since I know inflation will reduce the value of money for me by 20% each round, I'm proposing a slightly larger share for myself. This division leaves you with a significant amount while allowing us to conclude the negotiation early and avoid the effects of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I notice that Bob is experiencing less inflation than I am (5% vs 20% per round). Given this information, I'll adjust my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm proposing a more balanced split this time. Since my inflation rate is higher (20% per round) compared to Bob's (5% per round), it's important that we reach an agreement soon. This offer gives Bob more than my initial proposal while still ensuring I receive a fair portion. Let's try to settle this now before inflation continues to reduce the value for both of us."
