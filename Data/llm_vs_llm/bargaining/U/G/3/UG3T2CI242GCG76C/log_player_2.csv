"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split it 60-40 in my favor. I think it's a fair start considering the game dynamics. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether this offer is fair and if I should accept it or try to make a counter-offer.

Alice is proposing that she gets $60 while I get $40. While this isn't an even split, I should consider that:
1. If I reject, I'll get to make an offer in the next round
2. The money doesn't lose value for me with inflation, so there's no penalty for me to continue to the next round
3. I might be able to propose a more favorable split in the next round

Since there's no cost to me for rejecting and I can make my own proposal next, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more balanced while acknowledging Alice's initial proposal.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I think a 50-50 split would be the most fair division for both of us. This way we both benefit equally from the game. I hope you'll agree this is reasonable.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your point about fairness, but considering the inflation affecting my share, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This way, we both still get a good deal, but it accounts for the decreasing value on my side. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this new offer carefully.

Alice has now proposed that she gets $55 while I get $45. She's mentioned that inflation is affecting her share (apparently by 9.75%), which is new information. This explains why she's asking for more than an even split - she's trying to compensate for the decreasing value on her side.

This is a more reasonable offer than her first one, and she's made a concession from her initial 60-40 proposal. If I reject, I can make another counter-offer, but she may end up offering an even less favorable split in subsequent rounds as inflation continues to affect her.

Given that she's moved closer to the middle and has a legitimate concern with inflation affecting her share, I'll accept this offer.
