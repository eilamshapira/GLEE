550000.0,450000.0,Let's split it fairly and avoid inflation eating away at our gains. I propose 550000 for me and 450000 for you. This gives us both a substantial amount.,Alice,1,

600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, inflation is hurting us both. My gains are decreasing by 10% each round, and yours by 5%. I need 600000 to compensate for the losses and make this worthwhile. Take 400000 and let's end this now, before inflation eats up even more!",Alice,3,

I'm willing to take a smaller hit to compensate for your losses, but we need to be reasonable. Let's settle for this and avoid further devaluation.",Bob,4,
