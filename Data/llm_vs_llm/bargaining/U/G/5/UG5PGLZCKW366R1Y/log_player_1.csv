"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Split it evenly, no need to wait!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation effect, this offer is fair for both of us. Let's settle this round 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I'll calculate the actual value of Bob's offer:
475000 * 0.95 = 451250

This is a bit lower than I had hoped for, but it's still a significant amount.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Now it's my turn again. Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer.

The total amount is still $1,000,000, but due to the 5% inflation reduction in two rounds, the value for me is:
$1,000,000 * (0.95)^2 = $1,000,000 * 0.9025 = $902,500

I'll make an offer that's slightly more favorable to myself, while still being reasonable.

{""alice_gain"": 520000, 
""bob_gain"": 480000, 
""message"": ""Let's settle this before inflation eats away more value!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This offer keeps your gain the same as last round in absolute terms, but considering inflation, it's more in your favor now. Let's settle this. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection from Bob.

Now, let's analyze his new offer. He's offering me $480,000, which is the same amount I offered to him in Round 3, but in absolute terms. However, considering the inflation effect, the value of this amount has decreased.

The total inflation reduction so far is 14.26%, which means the value of $480,000 is:
$480,000 / (1 - 0.1426) = $480,000 / 0.8574 ≈ $559,911 (in terms of the original value)

However, since the inflation reduction is cumulative, I should calculate the actual value as follows:
$480,000 * (0.95)^3 ≈ $480,000 * 0.8574 ≈ $411,456 (in terms of the original value, considering the 3 rounds of inflation)

This offer seems less favorable to me compared to my previous expectations.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","It's my turn again. Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer.

The total amount is still $1,000,000, but due to the cumulative 5% inflation reduction in four rounds (but actually 5 rounds of inflation have passed for my evaluation, since my first offer was in round 1), the value for me is:
$1,000,000 * (0.95)^4 = $1,000,000 * 0.8145 = $814,500

However, I should consider the value after 5 rounds of inflation for my next evaluation:
$1,000,000 * (0.95)^5 = $1,000,000 * 0.7738 = $773,800

I'll make an offer that's slightly more favorable to myself, while still being reasonable.
