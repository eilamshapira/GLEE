"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The current offer gives me $3,000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 20% inflation, any amount in the next round will be worth 20% less to me
4. If I reject, my $3,000 would effectively become worth $2,400 in the next round
5. There's also no guarantee Alice would accept my counter-offer

While $3,000 out of $10,000 is not a great split (30/70), rejecting would put me at a disadvantage due to inflation. Making a better deal in the next round would be harder since I'd need to propose a significantly higher amount just to match the current real value.
