"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair offer to Bob that ensures we both get a good amount and avoid the inflation penalty.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose an equal split of $5,000 each. This is fair for both of us, and we can avoid the inflation penalty by agreeing now rather than dragging negotiations across multiple rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}

I see that Bob is looking for a slightly larger share. Let me compromise with a 45/55 split that gives Bob more while still ensuring I receive a fair portion. This is better for both of us than continuing to negotiate and losing more value to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
