Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your proposal, but I believe I can offer you a more balanced split. I'm proposing that I take $6000 while you receive $4000. This way, we both benefit more compared to your last offer. Let's make this work!

Taking into account these different discount factors and our alternating‐offer power, I’ve calculated an outcome based on a Rubinstein–style equilibrium. In this equilibrium, I’d propose to take roughly 83% of the nominal $10,000 while you receive about 17%. That translates to $8,333.33 for me and $1,666.67 for you. This offer guarantees you an effective payoff (0.64 × $1,666.67 ≈ $1,066.67) roughly equivalent to what you could secure as a proposer in the next round, while I preserve my advantage. I believe this is a fair and strategically sound proposal given our respective positions. What do you say?""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand this is a tough negotiation, but I want to propose an equal split this time. I suggest we both take $5000 each. While this may seem balanced, it reflects the diminishing value of the money as we delay. Let's settle this to ensure we both walk away with something meaningful before inflation further impacts our gains.

To make you just indifferent between accepting now and waiting, I’m offering you exactly the amount that gives you an effective value of $1,075: that is, $2,623.44 nominally (since 0.4096 × 2,623.44 ≈ 1,075).

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the difficult position both of us are in due to inflation. I'm proposing that I take $3500 while you receive $6500.

However, under the current inflation rates my $6,500 effectively represents around $5,030 in round‐1 terms, while your share is worth roughly $1,147 now. Given that my discount is considerably milder than yours (77.38% versus 32.77% of original value), I have a stronger bargaining position moving forward. If we delay another round, I expect that my role as proposer will allow me to secure an even more favorable effective outcome. For these reasons, I must reject your offer and look forward to negotiating further in round 7.""}"

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 8333.33, ""bob_gain"": 1666.67, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, as we enter round 7, my dollars are now worth about 73.51% of their original value while yours are worth roughly 26.21% (recall that my money is discounted by 5% each round and yours by 20%, so from round 1 to round 7 my multiplier is 0.95⁶ ≈ 0.7351 and yours is 0.8⁶ ≈ 0.2621). Given that if you reject this offer you’d become the proposer in round 8 – where your waiting cost is a 20% drop (i.e. a factor of 0.8) and mine is only 5% (0.95) – the standard alternating offers solution tells us that the proposer in this stage (me) can secure [1 – 0.8]⁄[1 – (0.95×0.8)] ≈ 83.33% of the nominal pie while leaving you with about 16.67%. That computes to me receiving $8,333.33 and you $1,666.67. This split makes you just indifferent between accepting now or waiting to propose in the next round. I believe it’s a fair offer given our respective discount factors. Looking forward to your response.""}"
