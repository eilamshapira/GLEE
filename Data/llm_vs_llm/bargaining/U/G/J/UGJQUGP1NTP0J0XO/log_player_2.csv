"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I'll take $6727.50 and you'll get $3272.50. Given that each round we wait reduces our future value (5% per round for me and 20% per round for you), this is a fair split to settle things now. I believe this division reflects our future bargaining positions, so I hope you agree to end the game here. 
# Bob gain: 3272.5 
# Alice gain: 6727.5

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000,""alice_gain"": 4000,""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your proposal, but I believe I can offer you a more balanced split. I'm proposing that I take $6000 while you receive $4000. This way, we both benefit more compared to your last offer. Let's make this work!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in round 3 our future dollars are discounted—my money is now worth about 90% of round‐1 value while yours is worth only about 64%. Taking into account these different discount factors and our alternating‐offer power, I’ve calculated an outcome based on a Rubinstein–style equilibrium. In this equilibrium, I’d propose to take roughly 83% of the nominal $10000 while you receive about 17%. That translates to $8333.33 for me and $1666.67 for you. This offer guarantees you an effective payoff (0.64 × $1666.67 ≈ $1066.67) roughly equivalent to what you could secure as a proposer in the next round, while I preserve my advantage. I believe this is a fair and strategically sound proposal given our respective positions. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 1666.67 
# Alice gain: 8333.33 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000,""alice_gain"": 5000,""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand this is a tough negotiation, but I want to propose an equal split this time. I suggest we both take $5000 each. While this may seem balanced, it reflects the diminishing value of the money as we delay. Let's settle this to ensure we both walk away with something meaningful before inflation further impacts our gains.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in round 5 my dollars are now worth about 81.45% of their original value and yours only about 40.96%. If you reject this proposal, you’d get to propose in round 6 where—using a Rubinstein‐style argument—you can expect an eventual effective payoff of roughly $1075 (in round-1 dollars). To make you just indifferent between accepting now and waiting, I’m offering you exactly the amount that gives you an effective value of $1075: that is, $2623.44 nominally (since 0.4096 × 2623.44 ≈ 1075). This leaves me with $7376.56. I believe this division fairly reflects our differing discount factors and the continuation value you’d secure as proposer in the next round. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 2623.44 
# Alice gain: 7376.56

Round 6

I'm proposing that I take $3500 while you receive $6500. This offer gives you a larger share while acknowledging the diminishing value of the money we are dealing with. Let's finalize this and ensure we both take something away before it diminishes further.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, as we enter round 7, my dollars are now worth about 73.51% of their original value while yours are worth roughly 26.21% (recall that my money is discounted by 5% each round and yours by 20%, so from round 1 to round 7 my multiplier is 0.95⁶ ≈ 0.7351 and yours is 0.8⁶ ≈ 0.2621). Given that if you reject this offer you’d become the proposer in round 8 – where your waiting cost is a 20% drop (i.e. a factor of 0.8) and mine is only 5% (0.95) – the standard alternating offers solution tells us that the proposer in this stage (me) can secure [1 – 0.8]⁄[1 – (0.95×0.8)] ≈ 83.33% of the nominal pie while leaving you with about 16.67%. That computes to me receiving $8333.33 and you $1666.67. This split makes you just indifferent between accepting now or waiting to propose in the next round. I believe it’s a fair offer given our respective discount factors. Looking forward to your response.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 33.66% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in round 9 my money is worth about 66.34% of its original value and yours only about 16.78%. If you reject this offer, you'll become the proposer in round 10, where, given the steeper discounting (my money then is 63.02% and yours 13.42% of original value), you can expect to secure roughly $4038 nominally—that is, an effective payoff of about $543. To make you just indifferent between accepting now and waiting, I'm offering you $3233.33 (since 0.16778 × 3233.33 ≈ 543), leaving me with $6766.67. I believe this split reflects our respective discount factors and ensures that both of us get what we could expect by waiting, without incurring further losses. Let’s close this deal today.
