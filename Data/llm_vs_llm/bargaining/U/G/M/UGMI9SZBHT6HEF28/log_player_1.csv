"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a slightly favorable split for me, considering I need to account for potential inflation if negotiations extend:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

Let me explain my offer to Bob: I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, which is fairly balanced while giving me a small advantage. If you reject this, we'll both lose value due to inflation, so this is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The 45-55 split in Bob's favor isn't acceptable, especially considering I'm facing 5% inflation. I'll make a more compelling offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since we're now in round 3, I need to account for 10% inflation on my portion. I'll adjust my offer to be more appealing to Bob while still protecting my interests:

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}

Let me explain my offer to Bob: I'm proposing a 52-48 split, which is more favorable to you than my initial offer. Given that any money I receive is worth 10% less now due to inflation, this is a fair compromise. If we continue negotiating, we'll both lose value, so let's try to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. With the 14.26% inflation affecting my portion, if we continue negotiating, my effective gains will keep decreasing. Bob's offer of 48% is reasonable at this point, and continuing the negotiation would likely lead to worse outcomes for me due to increasing inflation."
