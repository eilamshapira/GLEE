"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider the offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I receive $4,000 while she gets $6,000. If I reject, we'll move to the next round where I can make a counter-offer, but the total will be worth 5% less (so $9,500 total).

While the split isn't equal, getting $4,000 now is better than potentially getting less later if negotiations drag on with the 5% inflation penalty per round. However, I do have the opportunity to make a counter-offer in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that's a bit more balanced while acknowledging the inflation that's already occurred.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an equal split of the money, which I believe is fair for both of us. By accepting this proposal, we can both walk away with a reasonable amount rather than risking further depreciation of the total sum in additional rounds."
