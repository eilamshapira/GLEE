"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $40 while she gets $60. While this isn't an even split, it's not terribly unfair. However, since this is just the first round and I have the opportunity to make a counter-offer, I think I can try to negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a more equitable split, but still giving Alice a slight advantage to increase the chances she'll accept.

{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has slightly improved her offer from $40 to $42, but it's still quite far from an equal split. Since we still have 9 rounds left, I think I can try for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try a slightly more balanced offer, but still giving Alice a bit more to make it attractive for her to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52}"
