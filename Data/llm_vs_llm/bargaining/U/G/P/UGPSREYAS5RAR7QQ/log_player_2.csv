"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split this fairly. I'm offering you a solid 400k.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $400,000 out of $1,000,000 (40%)
2. If I reject, in the next round:
   - I can make a counter-offer
   - But the money will be worth 10% less to me
   - $400,000 now > $450,000 in next round after 10% inflation

While I could try to negotiate for more, the inflation penalty makes waiting risky. $400,000 is a substantial amount, and with inflation eating into future values, it might be better to accept now rather than risk getting less in real terms later.
