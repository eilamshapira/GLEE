"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I suggest a fair split where I get 55% and you get 45%. This is a reasonable offer considering we both want to avoid the 10% inflation penalty from delaying.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the inflation effect, I propose a 52.5% for me and 47.5% for you. This is a fair adjustment considering the value loss we're facing. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
* My gain would be $475,000, but with 10% inflation, it's actually worth $427,500 to me
* In the next round, I could make another offer, but any amount would be worth 20% less to me
* Bob seems to have a lower inflation rate (5%), which puts me at a disadvantage

Even though this isn't ideal, waiting another round would likely result in an even worse outcome for me due to the higher inflation rate I'm facing. I should accept this offer now rather than risk further value erosion.
