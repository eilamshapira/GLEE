"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I need to think about how to make a fair offer to Bob. Since I'm Alice and start first, I want to propose a division that is reasonable and takes into account the different inflation rates we face.

Since my inflation rate (10%) is higher than Bob's (5%), I'm more incentivized to reach an agreement early. However, I don't want to give up too much value.

I'll propose a slightly favorable split to myself, but not too greedy:

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. Since I have a higher inflation rate (10% vs your 5%), waiting is more costly for me than for you, but I think this is still a fair division that benefits us both.""}"
