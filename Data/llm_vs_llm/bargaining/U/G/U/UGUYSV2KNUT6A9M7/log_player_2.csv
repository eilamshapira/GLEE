"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, valuing your cooperation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's proposal gives me $450,000 and her $550,000. This isn't an equal split, but I need to consider the inflation penalty if I reject. If I reject, the total value decreases by 10% for me and 5% for Alice in the next round.

Let me evaluate if I can likely get a better deal by rejecting:
- If I reject, the $1,000,000 becomes worth $900,000 to me in the next round
- I could then propose a more favorable split

However, Alice might also reject my counter-offer, leading to further devaluation. Given the asymmetric inflation rates (10% for me vs 5% for Alice), prolonged negotiation favors Alice.

$450,000 is a substantial portion, and the 45%/55% split isn't terribly unfair considering our different inflation rates. I'll accept this offer.
