"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

My proposal is that I, Alice, receive $6000 and Bob receives $4000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this. Bob is offering me $4500. Since it's round 2, my money is worth 20% less. So, $4500 is actually worth $4500 * 0.8 = $3600 in terms of round 1 value. Bob gets $5500 which is worth $5500 for him.

I'll reject and try to make a more favorable offer in the next round, considering the inflation.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's round 3. My money is now worth 40% less than in round 1 (20% less each round). So any amount I get is multiplied by 0.6 to get its round 1 value.

To incentivize Bob to accept, I need to offer him a bit more, while still trying to get a decent amount myself.  I'll aim for a division where I get slightly more relative value, considering the inflation.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

My proposal is that I, Alice, receive $5500 and Bob receives $4500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this. Bob is offering me $4200. My money is now worth 48.8% less than in round 1. So, $4200 is actually worth $4200 * (1 - 0.488) = $4200 * 0.512 = $2150.4 in terms of round 1 value. Bob gets $5800, which is worth $5800 for him.

This is getting pretty bad for me due to the inflation. I am getting less than half of what Bob is getting. I will reject this and try one last time to get more money.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's round 5. My money is now worth 59.04% less than in round 1. So any amount I get is multiplied by 0.4096 to get its round 1 value. This is terrible!

Given how much the money is decaying in value for me, and the risk of getting nothing if we reach round 13, I'm going to make one last attempt to secure a reasonable amount. I'll offer Bob a larger share to try and get him to accept.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800
}
```

My proposal is that I, Alice, receive $5200 and Bob receives $4800."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this. Bob is offering me $4000. My money is now worth 67.23% less, meaning it's worth only 32.77% of its original value. So, $4000 is actually worth $4000 * 0.3277 = $1310.8 in terms of round 1 value. Bob gets $6000, which is worth $6000 for him.

This is a terrible offer, but considering the rate of decay and the risk of getting nothing, I'm running out of options. However, receiving $1310.8 compared to nothing is still a considerable amount.

""decision"": ""accept""
