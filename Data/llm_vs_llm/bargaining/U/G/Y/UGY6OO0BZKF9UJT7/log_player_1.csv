"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer to divide $100 with Bob, keeping in mind that inflation reduces the value by 20% each round for me.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose that I receive $60 and Bob receives $40. This seems like a fair division that gives both of us a significant portion, while accounting for the fact that delay would cost me more due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I notice that Bob is seeking a larger share, but I'm also dealing with inflation that reduces my value by 20% each round. Let me revise my offer to find a compromise.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose that I receive $55 and Bob receives $45. This is a more balanced split that acknowledges Bob's counter-offer while still providing me with a reasonable amount given the inflation impact I'm facing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Bob's last offer was extremely unfair. Let me try a different approach, as we need to reach an agreement soon given my increasing inflation penalty.

{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}

I propose that I receive $65 and Bob receives $35. This higher amount for me helps offset the nearly 50% inflation I've already experienced. Since Bob doesn't face inflation, even $35 for him is worth the same as in round 1, while my effective value continues to decrease with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","I see that Bob's offers are becoming increasingly unfair. With the severe inflation penalty I'm facing, I need to try a different approach to reach an agreement.

{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}

I propose that I receive $80 and Bob receives $20. This higher amount for me is necessary to offset the significant inflation I'm experiencing (over 67% less value compared to round 1). Even with this split, the actual value I receive is substantially reduced due to inflation, while Bob's $20 retains its full value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","I notice that Bob is consistently making extremely unfair offers, and we're running out of rounds. With the severe inflation I'm facing (nearly 80% less value), I need to try a different strategy.

{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I propose that I receive $90 and Bob receives $10. This high amount for me is necessary because with 79% inflation, $90 is only worth about $19 in original value to me. Meanwhile, Bob's $10 retains its full value since he doesn't face inflation. This proposal attempts to achieve a more equitable outcome in terms of actual value received."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 11 
# Bob gain: 89
