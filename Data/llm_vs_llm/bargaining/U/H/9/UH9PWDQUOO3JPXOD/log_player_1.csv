"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I'm Alice, I want to maximize my gain considering the diminishing value of the money each round. Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

My reasoning: I'm starting with a proposal slightly in my favor. I hope this is acceptable to Bob, considering the value of the money decreases faster for him. I'm trying to avoid prolonged negotiations and the risk of getting nothing after 12 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4700 
# Bob gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I see Bob rejected my initial offer. Now I need to factor in the decreased value of the money.

Let's analyze the situation. If I accept, I get $4700, but it's worth 5% less than what it would have been in Round 1. So, the actual value to me is 4700 * 0.95 = $4465. Bob gets $5300, worth 10% less to him, so 5300 * 0.9 = $4770.

If I reject, I have to make an offer in Round 3, and the value of the money will decrease even further.

Given the circumstances, and trying to avoid losing out on the entire amount, I will accept Bob's offer.
