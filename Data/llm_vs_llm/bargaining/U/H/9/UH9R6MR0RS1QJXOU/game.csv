5500.0,4500.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a division of $10000 where I get $5500 and you get $4500. Since each round delays the deal and my share depreciates by 10%, it makes sense to settle quickly. I believe this is a fair starting offer that saves us both from unnecessary losses. Looking forward to your responseâ€”Alice.",Alice,1,

5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I believe a 50-50 split is fairer and more equitable for both of us. Since the money's value isn't decreasing for me, I see no rush to settle for less than an equal share. Let's aim for a win-win situation. What do you think? - Bob",Bob,2,
