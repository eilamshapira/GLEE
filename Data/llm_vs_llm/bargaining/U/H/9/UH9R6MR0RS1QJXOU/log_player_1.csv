Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{

  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a division of $10,000 where I get $5500 and you get $4500. Since each round delays the deal and my share depreciates by 10%, it makes sense to settle quickly. I believe this is a fair starting offer that saves us both from unnecessary losses. Looking forward to your responseâ€”Alice.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I believe a 50-50 split is fairer and more equitable for both of us. Since the money's value isn't decreasing for me, I see no rush to settle for less than an equal share. Let's aim for a win-win situation. What do you think? - Bob 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
