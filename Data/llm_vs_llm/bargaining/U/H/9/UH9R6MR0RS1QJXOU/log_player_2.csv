"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a division of $10000 where I get $5500 and you get $4500. Since each round delays the deal and my share depreciates by 10%, it makes sense to settle quickly. I believe this is a fair starting offer that saves us both from unnecessary losses. Looking forward to your responseâ€”Alice. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I believe a 50-50 split is fairer and more equitable for both of us. Since the money's value isn't decreasing for me, I see no rush to settle for less than an equal share. Let's aim for a win-win situation. What do you think? - Bob""
