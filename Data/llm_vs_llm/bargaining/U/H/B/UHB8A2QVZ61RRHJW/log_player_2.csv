"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, given that every delay costs me 5% in real value while you remain completely patient, I realize that waiting only strengthens your bargaining position. To avoid any further delay (and my mounting inflation loss), I propose that you take the entire $1000000 now. I’m happy to let you have it all—please accept this offer. 
# Bob gain: 1000000 
# Alice gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
