"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's offer carefully.

Alice is offering me $350,000 out of the $1,000,000, while she keeps $650,000.

While this isn't an even split, it's still a substantial amount of money. Since there's no inflation for me, the value remains the same in future rounds. However, I don't know how inflation affects Alice, which is an interesting strategic element.

Given that we have 12 total rounds and this is just round 1, I believe I can make a counter-offer that might be more favorable to me. If Alice is affected by inflation, she might be more willing to accept a better offer from me in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split that gives me a better share while still being reasonable for Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose an even 50-50 split of the money, which I believe is fair for both of us. This gives each of us $500,000, which is a significant amount. A fair division will maximize our chances of reaching an agreement before the 12 rounds expire."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice has improved her offer to me - now offering $400,000 instead of her initial $350,000 offer. 

I also learn some important new information: Alice is affected by inflation, and quite significantly. The money she receives is now worth 36% less than in round 1. This gives me strategic leverage in later rounds, as her share will continue to devalue.

However, we're only in round 3 of 12, so I still have room to negotiate for a better deal. Given Alice's inflation penalty, she may become increasingly motivated to reach an agreement sooner rather than later.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice is facing significant inflation that reduces the value of her share, I'll adjust my offer to be more appealing to her while still improving my position compared to her last offer.

{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000}

I'm offering you $550,000, which is better than the previous split I proposed. Given the inflation affecting your share, I believe this is a fair offer that acknowledges both our interests. If we continue negotiating for too many more rounds, the inflation will significantly reduce the value of your portion, so this represents a good opportunity to reach an agreement now."
