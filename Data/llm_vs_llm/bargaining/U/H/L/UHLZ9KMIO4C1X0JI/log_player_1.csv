"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my first offer. Given we have limited rounds and there's inflation for both of us (more severely for me), I should make a reasonable offer.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose a split where I get $5,500 and you get $4,500. This is a fair offer considering the inflation rates affect me more severely than you, so reaching an agreement sooner is particularly valuable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
