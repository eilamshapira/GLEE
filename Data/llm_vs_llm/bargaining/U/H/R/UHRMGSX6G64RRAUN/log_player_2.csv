"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous! Let's split it fairly. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Given that:
1. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. BUT the money will be worth 5% less for me in the next round
4. $40 now is better than $42 in the next round (because of the 5% inflation)

While a 40-60 split isn't perfectly equal, it's a reasonable offer considering:
- I'd lose value due to inflation if I reject
- There's no guarantee Alice would accept a better offer from me
- $40 is a substantial portion of the total
