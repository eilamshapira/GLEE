6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get your money immediately without any inflation impact.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, let's start with a slightly better split for me, 55-45. It's still a very generous offer, and you get a guaranteed $4500 right now. Let's not risk losing it all to inflation and time!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6500.0,3500.0,"Bob, due to the 10% inflation penalty I face each round, I need a larger nominal amount to get fair value. With this split, my real value would be $5850 (6500 * 0.9^2), which is much more reasonable. Let's make a deal now before inflation reduces our potential gains further.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4800.0,5200.0,"Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but 65-35 is too steep. How about we meet in the middle a little? I'll take $5200, leaving you with $4800. That's still a good amount, especially considering inflation is affecting us both. Let's grab this deal before it gets worse!",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
7000.0,3000.0,"Bob, let me explain the math. With the 27.1% inflation I'm facing, this $7000 offer would give me about $5103 in real value (7000 * 0.729), while you get $3000. This is actually quite fair considering we started at 50-50 in real value. Let's agree now before inflation eats away more of our potential gains.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, let's just split it 50/50. I'm facing no inflation, and while you are, $5000 is still a decent amount considering. We are running out of time. This is a fair offer, let's take it.",Bob,6,
