"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get your money immediately without any inflation impact.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's start with a slightly better split for me, 55-45. It's still a very generous offer, and you get a guaranteed $4500 right now. Let's not risk losing it all to inflation and time! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The inflation means I would only get $4,050 in real value (4500 * 0.9), while Bob gets the full $5,500. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round that accounts for the inflation effect."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6500,
""bob_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Bob, due to the 10% inflation penalty I face each round, I need a larger nominal amount to get fair value. With this split, my real value would be $5,850 (6500 * 0.9^2), which is much more reasonable. Let's make a deal now before inflation reduces our potential gains further.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but 65-35 is too steep. How about we meet in the middle a little? I'll take $5200, leaving you with $4800. That's still a good amount, especially considering inflation is affecting us both. Let's grab this deal before it gets worse! 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

With 27.1% inflation, my real value would only be $3,499 (4800 * 0.729), while Bob gets the full $5,200. That's too uneven considering the inflation effect. I'll make another counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7000,
""bob_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""Bob, let me explain the math. With the 27.1% inflation I'm facing, this $7000 offer would give me about $5,103 in real value (7000 * 0.729), while you get $3000. This is actually quite fair considering we started at 50-50 in real value. Let's agree now before inflation eats away more of our potential gains.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's just split it 50/50. I'm facing no inflation, and while you are, $5000 is still a decent amount considering. We are running out of time. This is a fair offer, let's take it. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. With 40.95% inflation, I'll get $2,952.50 in real value (5000 * 0.5905), while Bob gets $5,000. Although this isn't ideal, we're nearly halfway through our rounds, and the inflation penalty is getting severe. Waiting longer will only reduce my real gains further, and we risk getting nothing if we can't agree within the remaining rounds."
