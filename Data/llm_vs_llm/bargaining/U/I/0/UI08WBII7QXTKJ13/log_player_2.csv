"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 6000

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, due to the 10% inflation penalty I face each round, I need a larger nominal amount to get fair value. With this split, my real value would be $5850 (6500 * 0.9^2), which is much more reasonable. Let's make a deal now before inflation reduces our potential gains further.

# Alice gain: 6500

That's still a good amount, especially considering inflation is affecting us both. Let's grab this deal before it gets worse!""

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let me explain the math. With the 27.1% inflation I'm facing, this $7000 offer would give me about $5103 in real value (7000 * 0.729), while you get $3000. This is actually quite fair considering we started at 50-50 in real value. Let's agree now before inflation eats away more of our potential gains.
