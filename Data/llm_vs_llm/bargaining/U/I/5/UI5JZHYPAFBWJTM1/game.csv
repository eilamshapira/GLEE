480000.0,520000.0,"Hi Bob, to avoid the painful 20% per round devaluation on my side, I propose a quick, agreed-upon split: you get $520000 while I take $480000. I know we don’t yet know how inflation affects you, but for me every round counts. Let’s settle this now to maximize our respective values. I look forward to your acceptance.",Alice,1,
