"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 480000, ""bob_gain"": 520000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, to avoid the painful 20% per round devaluation on my side, I propose a quick, agreed-upon split: you get $520,000 while I take $480,000. I know we don’t yet know how inflation affects you, but for me every round counts. Let’s settle this now to maximize our respective values. I look forward to your acceptance.""}"
