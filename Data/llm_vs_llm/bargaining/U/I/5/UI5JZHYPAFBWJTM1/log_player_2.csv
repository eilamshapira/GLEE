"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to avoid the painful 20% per round devaluation on my side, I propose a quick, agreed-upon split: you get $520000 while I take $480000. I know we don’t yet know how inflation affects you, but for me every round counts. Let’s settle this now to maximize our respective values. I look forward to your acceptance. 
# Bob gain: 520000 
# Alice gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice claims she has 20% inflation per round, but we don't know if that's true
2. My inflation is 5% per round
3. The offer gives me $520,000 (52%) and her $480,000 (48%)
4. If I reject, my next offer would be worth 5% less to me
5. This is actually a pretty fair initial offer, slightly in my favor

Given that:
- I'm getting more than half
- Every round reduces my value by 5%
- There's risk in prolonging negotiations
- This is a reasonable first offer
