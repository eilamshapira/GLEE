"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer in this first round considering that Bob faces a 20% loss in value per round while I face no inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This gives you a significant amount ($400,000) right now, which is better than waiting for future rounds where your money would be worth less due to the 20% inflation you face per round."
