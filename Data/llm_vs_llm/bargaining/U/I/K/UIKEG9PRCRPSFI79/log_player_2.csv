"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, here’s my offer: I take $100000 and you get $900000. Keep in mind that if we delay further, your dollars will lose 10% of their value every round, while mine remain undiminished. Accepting now protects you from that discount – a smart, immediate move. 
# Bob gain: 900000 
# Alice gain: 100000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically.

If I accept now:
- I get $900,000
- Alice gets $100,000

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
- My money will be worth 10% less
- Maximum I could get would be $900,000 * 0.9 = $810,000 (even if I proposed keeping everything)
- Alice's money doesn't depreciate

Since any future round would result in me getting less value due to the 10% depreciation, and this is actually a quite favorable split (90-10 in my favor), it's in my best interest to accept this offer.
