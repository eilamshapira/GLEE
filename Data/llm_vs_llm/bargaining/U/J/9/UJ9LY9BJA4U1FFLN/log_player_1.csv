"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a reasonable first offer, considering the 5% inflation penalty for each round if rejected.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split as it's slightly in my favor but still fair enough that Bob might accept it. If he rejects, my next opportunity will be worth less due to inflation, so I want to make a serious offer that has a good chance of being accepted."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6400 
# Bob gain: 3600 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob is offering me $6400, which due to 5% inflation is actually worth $6080 to me
2. This is better than my initial offer of $5500
3. If I reject, the next round will have another 5% inflation for me
4. I am unlikely to get a better deal considering the inflation effect
