55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob! I'm proposing a fairly balanced split where I get $55 and you get $45. This is close to 50-50 and fair for both of us. Keep in mind that inflation affects me more than you (20% vs 5%), so accepting early benefits both of us, especially me. Let's avoid dragging this out.",Alice,1,

40.0,60.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your point about inflation, but I think your initial offer was a bit biased towards you. Considering the inflation rates, I'm willing to take a bit more since it affects me less. My offer is $60 for me and $40 for you. This way, we both get a decent amount, and it's still relatively early in the game.",Bob,2,

52.0,48.0,"Bob, I understand your perspective, but let's find a middle ground. With my higher inflation rate (20% vs your 5%), each round costs me significantly more. I'm offering you $48, which is an increase from my first offer. If we continue back and forth, we both lose value - especially me. Let's settle this now with a fair compromise that acknowledges both our positions.",Alice,3,

38.0,62.0,"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think the offer is slightly in your favor. Given the increasing impact of inflation on your side, I'm willing to take a bit more risk and continue negotiating. My new offer is $62 for me and $38 for you. I believe this is a more balanced split, considering the current state of inflation.",Bob,4,

50.0,50.0,"Bob, we're now in round 5, and inflation has already reduced my potential gains by nearly 50%. I'm offering a perfectly fair 50-50 split. This is the standard of fairness in most negotiations. If we continue, I'll lose significantly more value than you due to my 20% inflation rate compared to your 5%. At this point, a 50-50 split is actually generous given our different inflation rates. Let's end this now with a fair and equal division.",Alice,5,
