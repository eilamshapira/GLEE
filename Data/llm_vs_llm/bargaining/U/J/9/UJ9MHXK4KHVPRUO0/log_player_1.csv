"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I need to make a fair offer to Bob, keeping in mind the differing inflation rates. Since we both stand to lose if we drag this out too long, I should propose something reasonable that Bob would accept.

{""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm proposing a fairly balanced split where I get $55 and you get $45. This is close to 50-50 and fair for both of us. Keep in mind that inflation affects me more than you (20% vs 5%), so accepting early benefits both of us, especially me. Let's avoid dragging this out.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your point about inflation, but I think your initial offer was a bit biased towards you. Considering the inflation rates, I'm willing to take a bit more since it affects me less. My offer is $60 for me and $40 for you. This way, we both get a decent amount, and it's still relatively early in the game. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a more strategic offer considering the inflation rates and the progression of rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 52,
""bob_gain"": 48,
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but let's find a middle ground. With my higher inflation rate (20% vs your 5%), each round costs me significantly more. I'm offering you $48, which is an increase from my first offer. If we continue back and forth, we both lose value - especially me. Let's settle this now with a fair compromise that acknowledges both our positions.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think the offer is slightly in your favor. Given the increasing impact of inflation on your side, I'm willing to take a bit more risk and continue negotiating. My new offer is $62 for me and $38 for you. I believe this is a more balanced split, considering the current state of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 38 
# Bob gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I need to be more strategic now, as inflation is significantly reducing my potential gains.

{""alice_gain"": 50,
""bob_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Bob, we're now in round 5, and inflation has already reduced my potential gains by nearly 50%. I'm offering a perfectly fair 50-50 split. This is the standard of fairness in most negotiations. If we continue, I'll lose significantly more value than you due to my 20% inflation rate compared to your 5%. At this point, a 50-50 split is actually generous given our different inflation rates. Let's end this now with a fair and equal division.""}"
