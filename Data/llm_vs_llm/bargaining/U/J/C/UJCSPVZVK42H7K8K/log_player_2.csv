"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's start with a fair offer. I propose 55 for me and 45 for you. Let's secure some money early! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $45 while she gets $55 out of the $100. This isn't a 50-50 split, but it's fairly close.

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round. However, inflation will reduce the total value by 10%, so we'd only be dividing $90. I could propose a more favorable split for myself, but Alice might reject it, and we'd lose another 10%.

Given that this is a reasonable first offer and that the declining value of money favors early agreement, I'll accept this offer.
