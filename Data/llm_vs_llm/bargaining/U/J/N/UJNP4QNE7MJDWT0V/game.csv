4800.0,5200.0,"Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but considering that every round costs some value to me, let's settle now. I propose I receive $5200 and you get $4800. This deal ensures we both get a fair share before further rounds erode the total amount. What do you say?",Bob,2,

5550.0,4450.0,"Alice, I realize the game is pressing us with inflationâ€”my money is now only worth about 90.25% of what it was, and yours about 64%. To avoid further losses, I propose we settle now. I offer you $5550 and keep $4450 for myself. This deal gives you an effective value of roughly $3552 while mine comes to about $4026, a modest difference reflecting our inflation differences. I believe this is attractive given what we've seen and the risk of further devaluation. What do you say?",Bob,4,
