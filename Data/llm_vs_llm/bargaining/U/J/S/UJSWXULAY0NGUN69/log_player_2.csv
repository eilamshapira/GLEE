"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
- Alice is offering me $400,000 (40%) while keeping $600,000 (60%) for herself
- This is not an equal split, but it's still a substantial amount of money
- I have 11 more rounds if I reject, but there's risk in prolonging negotiation
- I could try to negotiate for a more equal split

I'll reject this offer and propose a more equitable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more equitable split, but still giving Alice a slight advantage to increase chances of acceptance:

{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000}

This offer is more balanced than the previous one, giving me 48% and Alice 52%. It's a fair proposal that acknowledges both our interests while being much closer to an equal split."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:
- Alice has increased her offer from $400K to $420K
- She's still keeping a significant majority ($580K vs $420K)
- We have 9 rounds remaining
- She did respond to my more balanced proposal by moving in my direction, but only slightly
- There's still room for negotiation, but time pressure is building

Since she showed some flexibility by improving her offer, I'll continue negotiating but need to be careful about not running out of rounds.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice has shown some willingness to move towards a more equal split by increasing her previous offer, I'll also adjust my offer slightly to show flexibility while still maintaining a reasonably fair position:

{""bob_gain"": 470000, ""alice_gain"": 530000}

This offer is slightly more favorable to Alice than my last proposal (giving her 53% instead of 52%) while still being much more balanced than her offers. It shows I'm willing to compromise but still want a relatively fair split."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","Analyzing the negotiation progress:
- Alice has increased her offer again by $10K (from $420K to $430K)
- She's making small incremental concessions
- We're now in round 5, with 7 rounds remaining
- The pattern suggests she might continue to increase offers gradually
- However, we're also burning through rounds quickly

While I believe a more equitable split is possible, there's increasing risk in continuing to negotiate. However, since Alice has shown a consistent pattern of improving offers, I'll reject one more time to try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that Alice has been making small incremental increases and we're now in round 6 (halfway through), I'll make a more significant concession to try to reach an agreement:

{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000}

This offer gives Alice 55% while still securing a reasonable 45% for myself. It's a substantial move from my previous position and meets Alice's gradual increases more than halfway. This should signal my serious intent to reach an agreement while still maintaining a more balanced split than her last offer."
