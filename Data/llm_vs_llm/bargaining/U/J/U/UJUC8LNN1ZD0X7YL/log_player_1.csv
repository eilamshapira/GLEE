"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I propose that I get $60 and you get $40. It's still early in the game, and we'd each be getting a fair share considering the rounds ahead. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I suggest a more balanced split where I get $55 and you get $45. This is fair and prevents further value loss from inflation. Let's make a deal now. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
