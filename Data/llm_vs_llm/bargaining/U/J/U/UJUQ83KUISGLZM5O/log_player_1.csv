"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000, ""message"": ""Bob, I propose a quick settlement: I take $850,000 and you get $150,000. With each round delaying the agreement, you lose 20% of the payout value while I lose only 5%—it makes sense for both of us to agree now to maximize our actual gains. What do you say?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. While I understand your initial offer, I believe this is a more equitable distribution given the potential for devaluation in each subsequent round. Let's work together to secure a fair outcome. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 333333, ""bob_gain"": 666667, ""message"": ""Bob, we’re now at round 3 and time is running out. Remember that in each new round your money loses 20% of its original value, while mine only lose 5% per round. At this stage, your share is effectively worth 666667 × 60% = 400,000 relative to the full pot. If you reject and move to round 4 as proposer, you can secure nearly the entire 1,000,000, but at 40% its original value—that’s still about 400,000 effective for you, leaving me almost nothing. Since waiting won’t improve your effective outcome and will only hurt both of us further, I propose we settle now with me receiving 333,333 and you 666,667. This deal secures you the same effective value you’d expect by waiting, but without additional risk. What do you say?""}"
