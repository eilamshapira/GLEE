"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I propose a quick settlement: I take $850000 and you get $150000. With each round delaying the agreement, you lose 20% of the payout value while I lose only 5%—it makes sense for both of us to agree now to maximize our actual gains. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Alice, I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. While I understand your initial offer, I believe this is a more equitable distribution given the potential for devaluation in each subsequent round. Let's work together to secure a fair outcome.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we’re now at round 3 and time is running out. Remember that in each new round your money loses 20% of its original value, while mine only lose 5% per round. At this stage, your share is effectively worth 666667 × 60% = 400000 relative to the full pot. If you reject and move to round 4 as proposer, you can secure nearly the entire 1000000, but at 40% its original value—that’s still about 400000 effective for you, leaving me almost nothing. Since waiting won’t improve your effective outcome and will only hurt both of us further, I propose we settle now with me receiving 333333 and you 666667. This deal secures you the same effective value you’d expect by waiting, but without additional risk. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 666667 
# Alice gain: 333333
