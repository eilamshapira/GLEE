"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I propose an equal split of $50 each. This deal is immediate and avoids any inflation risk that comes with delay. Let's both secure our fair share now! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice proposes a 50-50 split, which is fair on the surface
2. If I reject, the next round will have 5% inflation, meaning any amount I get will be worth less
3. A 50-50 split in the first round avoids any value loss from inflation
4. Even if I could get more in later rounds, the inflation penalty might offset those gains
5. This is a reasonable first offer that gives me a fair share without risk
