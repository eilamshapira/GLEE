"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's make a fair split considering inflation. I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which is reasonable given that you lose more value than I do with each round.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the inflation puts me at a disadvantage, but a 60-40 split is too much. I propose a 55-45 split in your favor - a more reasonable compromise that still accounts for the time pressure. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Reasoning (not part of response): This is a good offer to accept because:
1. If I reject, the next round's money will be worth 5% less to me
2. The 55-45 split is fairly reasonable given the inflation dynamics
3. Bob is already taking a bigger hit from inflation (20% vs my 5%)
4. Continuing the negotiation might lead to worse outcomes due to the compounding inflation effect"
