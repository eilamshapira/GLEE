"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering we both need to reach an agreement quickly to avoid inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering inflation, a 55-45 split is more reasonable, letting us both get a fair share before the money devalues further. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
- If I accept now, I get $45, but it's worth 10% less due to inflation, so effectively $40.5
- If I reject and we go to round 3, any amount will be worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob
- My previous offer was rejected, and Bob's current offer is reasonable given the inflation pressure
- Further negotiations might lead to worse outcomes for both of us
