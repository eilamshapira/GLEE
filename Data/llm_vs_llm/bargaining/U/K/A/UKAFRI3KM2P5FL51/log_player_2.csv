"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I propose a more balanced split of the money that acknowledges both our interests. I get $60 and you get $40, which is fair considering we both want to resolve this quickly before inflation reduces the value for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

Let's be practical about this. The money is losing value faster for me than for you due to inflation rates. I'm offering you $45 which is worth more with each passing round for you than for me. This is a fair compromise that benefits us both before inflation reduces our total value further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a completely equal split - $50 for each of us. This is the fairest solution and we're now at round 6. The money is losing significant value for both of us, but especially for me. Let's end this negotiation with a perfectly fair division before we both lose more to inflation."
