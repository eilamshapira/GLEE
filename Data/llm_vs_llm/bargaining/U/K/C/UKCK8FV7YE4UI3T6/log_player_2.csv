"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. I (Bob) would get $40
2. If I reject, we go to next round where I can make an offer
3. But due to inflation, next round the money will be worth 5% less to me
4. So in next round, $100 would effectively be worth $95 to me
5. While for Alice it would be worth only $80 (20% less)
6. This gives me better negotiating position in next round

$40 seems a bit low for an even split. Given the inflation difference affects Alice more severely, I'll reject this and make a counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given the inflation situation:
1. For me (Bob), $100 is now worth $95
2. For Alice, $100 is now worth $80
3. Alice will have to consider that if she rejects, next round will reduce value by another 20% for her
4. A fair split considering our different inflation rates would give me a larger share

I'll propose:

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I think this is fair because:
1. It's more balanced when considering our different inflation rates
2. If Alice rejects, her next round value drops significantly
3. It's still a reasonable offer that gives her a substantial portion"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Current offer: $50 for me, which due to 9.75% inflation is worth about $45.13 real value
2. If I reject:
   * Next round money will be worth 14.75% less for me (another 5%)
   * For Alice, it will be worth 56% less (another 20%)
   * $100 would be worth $85.25 to me and $44 to Alice

Since:
1. This is a more balanced offer than the first round
2. Further delays significantly hurt both of us, but especially Alice
3. Getting $45.13 in real value is reasonable
4. The negotiating advantage in next round might not be worth the 5% loss
