"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split where I get 55% and you get 45%. This way we both walk away with a substantial amount and avoid the risk of inflation reducing our gains in later rounds.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation risk, a 50-50 split seems fair to me. This way, we both get an equal share and avoid further devaluation of the money. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Reasoning (not part of response): I'll accept this offer because:
1. With 10% inflation, my $500,000 is now worth $450,000 in round 1 terms
2. If I reject, my next offer would be subject to 20% inflation
3. Bob's offer is reasonable and fair
4. The risk of continuing and potentially losing everything after 12 rounds is not worth it
5. A guaranteed $450,000 (in round 1 value) is better than risking further devaluation"
