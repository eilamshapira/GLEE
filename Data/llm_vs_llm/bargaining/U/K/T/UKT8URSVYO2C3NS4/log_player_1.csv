"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a fair 60-40 split. Since you face 20% depreciation per round, accepting now is better than counter-offering.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the time pressure, but 60-40 is a bit too skewed for me. How about we meet in the middle with a 55-45 split in your favor? 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Reasoning (not part of response):
This is a good offer to accept because:
1. The money is still worth full value to me (55$)
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer, Bob's share will be worth 20% less to him in the next round, making him less likely to accept
3. The difference between this offer (55$) and my initial offer (60$) is relatively small
4. Prolonging negotiations risks reaching the 12-round limit where we both get nothing
5. It's a reasonable compromise that gives both parties a significant share"
