600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, let's make a fair split where I get $600000 and you get $400000. This gives you a substantial amount while accounting for my inflation pressure of 20% per round. If we go to another round, the total value to me drops significantly, so I hope we can agree now and both walk away happy.",Alice,1,

700000.0,300000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your proposal, but I'd like to make a new offer. How about I take $300000 and you take $700000? I believe this division allows me to still walk away with something while giving you the majority.",Bob,2,
