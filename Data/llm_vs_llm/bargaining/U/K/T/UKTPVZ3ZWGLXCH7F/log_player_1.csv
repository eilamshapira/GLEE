"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's make a fair split where I get $600,000 and you get $400,000. This gives you a substantial amount while accounting for my inflation pressure of 20% per round. If we go to another round, the total value to me drops significantly, so I hope we can agree now and both walk away happy.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your proposal, but I'd like to make a new offer. How about I take $300000 and you take $700000? I believe this division allows me to still walk away with something while giving you the majority. 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
