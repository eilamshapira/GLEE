"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's make a fair split where I get $600000 and you get $400000. This gives you a substantial amount while accounting for my inflation pressure of 20% per round. If we go to another round, the total value to me drops significantly, so I hope we can agree now and both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 300000,""alice_gain"": 700000,""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your proposal, but I'd like to make a new offer. How about I take $300,000 and you take $700,000? I believe this division allows me to still walk away with something while giving you the majority.""}"
