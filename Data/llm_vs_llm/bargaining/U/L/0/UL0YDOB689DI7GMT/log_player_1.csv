"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, to avoid the impact of inflation on my share, I'm proposing we settle immediately with a 55-45 split in my favor. I believe this fair offer benefits both of us now, so let's close the deal before any value is lost.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the impact of inflation, I think an equal split is the fairest way to divide the money. This way, we both get the same amount, and it's better to settle now rather than losing more value in the next rounds. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
