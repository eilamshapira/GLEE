"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's get this done quickly! I propose 60/40 split, my favor. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100. If I reject and move to the next round, the money will be worth 10% less to me, so $100 becomes worth $90. Even if I could get a better split next round, I need to factor in this depreciation.

$40 now is better than potentially getting $45 of next round's $90 (which would effectively be worth $40.5). The risk of further rounds and continued depreciation makes this a reasonable first offer.
