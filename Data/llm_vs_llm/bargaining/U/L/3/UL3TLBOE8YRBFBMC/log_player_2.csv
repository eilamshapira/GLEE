Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a larger share.  I'm proposing 57/43. It's a smaller gain for me than my last offer, reflecting the inflation, but still gives us both a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700
