While this offer is slightly better than Alice's first offer, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  The impact of inflation is starting to become significant, but I'm willing to gamble that I can get a better deal in later rounds."

It pains me to accept this, but time is running out.  While still in Alice's favor, this offer is getting close to an even split after accounting for the significant inflation we've both experienced. If I reject this, I risk walking away with nothing."
