"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Alice is offering me 4000$ out of 10,000$, which is 40% of the total. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but the money will be worth 10% less to me (and 5% less to her).

If I reject, in Round 2 the 10,000$ will effectively be worth 9,000$ to me and 9,500$ to Alice. While I could propose a better split for myself, there's a risk of further depreciation if she rejects.

Since this is the first round and the money has its full value, and 4000$ is a substantial amount, I'll reject to try to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer, considering that the money has already depreciated for both of us (10% for me, 5% for Alice).

I'll propose a more equitable split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the offer:

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I think this is a fair offer because:
1. It's closer to a 50-50 split, which is generally seen as fair
2. Even with the current depreciation, both of us would get a good amount
3. If Alice rejects, the money will be worth even less in the next round for both of us"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3250 
# Alice gain: 6750 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice's offer of 3250$ is actually worth even less to me due to 19% inflation:
   * Real value for me = 3250 * (1 - 0.19) = 2632.5$

2. This is worse than her first offer (4000$)!

3. If I reject, in the next round:
   * The money will depreciate further (29% for me, 14.75% for Alice)
   * But I'll get to make the offer

4. There's still plenty of rounds left (9 more), but the rapid depreciation is concerning

Given that this offer is significantly worse than the first one, and I still have a chance to make a better counter-offer in the next round:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me strategize here. The money has depreciated significantly:
- For me: 29% less valuable
- For Alice: 14.75% less valuable

Alice has shown she wants a larger share, but we need to find a middle ground before the money loses too much value. I'll make a more compromising offer while still ensuring I get a decent amount:

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

My reasoning:
1. A 50-50 split is harder to reject on principle
2. For me, 5000$ * (1-0.29) = 3550$ real value
3. For Alice, 5000$ * (1-0.1475) = 4262.5$ real value
4. This is better than her last offer for me, while still giving her a good amount
5. Further delays will hurt both of us significantly"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 6790.95 
# Alice gain: 3209.05 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting turn! Let me analyze Alice's offer:

1. Alice is offering me 6790.95$, but with 34.39% inflation:
   * Real value for me = 6790.95 * (1 - 0.3439) = 4455.75$

2. This is actually the best real value I've been offered so far:
   * Round 1: 4000$
   * Round 3: 2632.5$
   * Round 5: 4455.75$

3. If I reject:
   * Further depreciation will occur
   * No guarantee of getting a better offer
   * Already in round 5 of 12

4. This is a significant shift in Alice's strategy, offering me the larger share, and even with inflation, it's a good deal for me.

Given that this is the best effective offer I've received, and the risk of further depreciation:
