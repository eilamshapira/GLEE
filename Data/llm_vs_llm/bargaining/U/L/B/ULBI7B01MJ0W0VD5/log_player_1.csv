"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my first offer to divide $10,000.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This gives you a substantial portion Bob, and considering the different inflation rates affecting us, this division is reasonable. If we drag this out, we both lose value, but you lose more with your higher inflation rate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm revising my offer to a more balanced split. Bob, this gives you $4,500 which, even with the current inflation, is better than waiting longer. Remember, each round your money loses 10% of its value while mine only loses 5%. This is a fair compromise that benefits us both, as continued delays will significantly reduce the actual value we each receive."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 4200

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5300, ""bob_gain"": 4700}

I'm offering you $4,700 now, Bob. Let's be practical - the inflation is hurting both of us, but it's affecting you more significantly with your 10% rate versus my 5%. At this point, we're in round 5, and your money has already lost over 27% of its value. If we continue, your share will be worth even less. This is a reasonable compromise that recognizes both our positions and the time pressure we face."

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

Bob, I'm proposing a straight 50-50 split. We're now in round 7, and inflation has significantly reduced our potential gains. Your share has already lost nearly 41% of its value due to your 10% inflation rate, while mine has lost about 23% with my 5% rate. This equal division is fair and practical given our circumstances. If we continue negotiating, we both lose more value with each round, and you're losing at a faster rate. Let's end this now with an even split and both walk away with something meaningful."
