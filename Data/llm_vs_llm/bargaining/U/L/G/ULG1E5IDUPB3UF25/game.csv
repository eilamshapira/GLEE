500000.0,500000.0,"Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we both walk away happy.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"I appreciate your fair offer, but I believe I can add more value to this money in the long term. I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which still leaves you with a substantial $400000. Let's conclude this now and both walk away with good gains.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Bob, considering the inflation affecting my share, I'm proposing a 45-55 split in your favor. This way, you still get more, and I get a fair amount considering the reduced value. Let's end this on a reasonable note.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"Alice, considering the inflation affecting your share, waiting longer will only decrease the real value you receive. I'm offering you $300000 now, which is better than getting a larger nominal amount that's worth less due to inflation in future rounds. This is a practical solution that benefits both of us - let's conclude this now.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Bob, with inflation now at 27.1% for me, I'm willing to accept a 40-60 split in your favor. This offer still gives you a significant portion while ensuring I get a reasonable amount despite the reduced value. Let's settle this now before it gets worse for me.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
200000.0,800000.0,"Alice, with inflation severely impacting your share (over 34% loss already), any delay will significantly reduce the real value you receive. $200000 now is worth more to you than a larger amount that will be heavily devalued in future rounds. This is your best option to preserve value - let's conclude this now before inflation erodes your share further.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"Bob, with inflation now at 40.95% for me, I'm proposing a 35-65 split in your favor. This is a significant concession on my part, but it's crucial we end this soon. Let's agree on this before the value drops even more for me.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
150000.0,850000.0,"Alice, you're now losing almost 47% of your value to inflation, and this rate is accelerating dramatically each round. $150000 now is worth more to you than any larger amount in future rounds that will be devastated by inflation. This offer gives you real value of about $79710, which is better than what you'd effectively get by continuing negotiations. Let's end this now before your share loses even more value.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"Bob, with inflation now at 52.17% for me, I'm willing to accept a 30-70 split in your favor. This is a significant compromise on my part, but we need to end this before the value of my share diminishes even further. Let's conclude this now.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
100000.0,900000.0,"Alice, your situation has become critical with inflation erasing almost 57% of your value. At this rate, any further delay will be catastrophic for your share. $100000 now is worth about $43050 in real value to you, but this is still better than a larger nominal amount that will be almost worthless after another round of severe inflation. This is your last chance to secure any meaningful value - let's conclude this now.",Bob,10,
