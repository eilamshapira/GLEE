Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fair offer, but I believe I can add more value to this money in the long term. I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which still leaves you with a substantial $400000. Let's conclude this now and both walk away with good gains. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the inflation affecting your share, waiting longer will only decrease the real value you receive. I'm offering you $300000 now, which is better than getting a larger nominal amount that's worth less due to inflation in future rounds. This is a practical solution that benefits both of us - let's conclude this now.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, with inflation severely impacting your share (over 34% loss already), any delay will significantly reduce the real value you receive. $200000 now is worth more to you than a larger amount that will be heavily devalued in future rounds. This is your best option to preserve value - let's conclude this now before inflation erodes your share further.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're now losing almost 47% of your value to inflation, and this rate is accelerating dramatically each round. $150000 now is worth more to you than any larger amount in future rounds that will be devastated by inflation. This offer gives you real value of about $79710, which is better than what you'd effectively get by continuing negotiations. Let's end this now before your share loses even more value.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your situation has become critical with inflation erasing almost 57% of your value. At this rate, any further delay will be catastrophic for your share. $100000 now is worth about $43050 in real value to you, but this is still better than a larger nominal amount that will be almost worthless after another round of severe inflation. This is your last chance to secure any meaningful value - let's conclude this now. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000
