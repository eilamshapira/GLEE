"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me propose a fair division considering the 20% inflation penalty per round that affects my gains.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. This is slightly in my favor but still quite fair, considering that if Bob rejects and we go to additional rounds, my share will be worth less due to inflation. I'm offering Bob a substantial portion to encourage acceptance and avoid the inflation penalty on my gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer:
- Bob is offering a 50-50 split ($5000 each)
- However, due to inflation, my $5000 is actually worth only $4000 to me (20% less)
- If I reject, I can make a new offer next round, but I'll face 40% inflation then
- A 40% inflation would mean my next round's money would be worth even less

While I might have preferred a slightly better deal, accepting now is better than risking further inflation penalties.
