"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I take $400,000 while she gets $600,000. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the total amount will be worth 10% less (so $900,000 total).

I'll make a strategic decision.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair offer considering the 10% inflation that has already occurred.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing an equal split where we both receive $500,000. This is a fair division that maximizes our combined utility, and it's better for Alice than what she would get if we continue to later rounds with increasing inflation."
