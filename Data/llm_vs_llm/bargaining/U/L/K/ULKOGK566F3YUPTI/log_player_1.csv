"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a slightly favorable split for myself since Bob can counter-offer, but I need to make it attractive enough for him to accept given the inflation risk.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose I get $60 and Bob gets $40. This is a fair offer considering I'm making the first move, and if Bob rejects, the total value will decrease due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
- If I accept now, I'll get $55, but due to 20% inflation, it's actually worth $44 to me
- If I reject and make a counter-offer, any amount I get will be worth another 20% less due to inflation
- My previous offer was rejected, suggesting Bob won't accept highly unfavorable splits
- Further negotiations might lead to even worse outcomes due to compounding inflation

Given that $44 (after inflation) is still a reasonable amount and continuing would mean more value loss, I should accept this offer.
