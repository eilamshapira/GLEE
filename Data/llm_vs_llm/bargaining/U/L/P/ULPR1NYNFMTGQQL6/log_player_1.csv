Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your initial offer was a good starting point, but let's find something a bit more balanced. How about this? 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer. Given that my money would be worth 20% less each round and Bob's offer is fairly reasonable, it makes sense to accept now rather than risk further devaluation through continued negotiation."
