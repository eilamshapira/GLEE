"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make the first proposal to divide the $100.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I believe this is a fair first offer that gives both of us a significant portion of the money. Since there's inflation for me in later rounds, I'd like to reach an agreement early, but I'm also offering Bob a substantial share to make this attractive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new proposal for round 3.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm offering an equal split of the money. With inflation affecting my gains by 10% each round, it's in my interest to reach an agreement soon, and a 50-50 split is traditionally seen as the fairest division. I hope we can reach an agreement with this balanced offer."
