"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. I want to make a reasonable offer that Bob is likely to accept, considering the diminishing value of the money and the limited number of rounds. I will propose a split that gives me a slightly larger portion, but still leaves Bob with a good amount, hoping he will accept to avoid further loss.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
