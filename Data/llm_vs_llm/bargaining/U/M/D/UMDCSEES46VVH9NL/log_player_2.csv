"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $45 and keeping $55
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. However, due to 20% inflation for me, in the next round the $100 will only be worth $80 from my perspective
4. $45 now is better than having the possibility of getting a larger share of a depreciated amount

Since $45 is a fairly reasonable offer and the inflation penalty for rejecting is significant, I'll accept.
