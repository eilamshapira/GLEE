"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the $1000000 equallyâ€”$500000 each. This way, we can both secure a fair share right away without risking any unforeseen inflation issues. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","This seems like a fair initial offer from Alice. With 5% inflation per round, waiting reduces the value of any future offers. An equal split gives me $500,000 without any loss due to inflation.
