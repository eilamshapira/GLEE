Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm taking a bigger risk playing second. This offer reflects that. It's fair given the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5700,
""bob_gain"": 4300,
""message"": ""Bob, my turn and the clock is ticking.  This offer is still generous considering the inflation working against me. Let's close this deal.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the value decreases. Bob needs to understand the urgency.
* **Fairness (with a tilt):** I'm acknowledging the inflation disparity by slightly lowering my initial ask while still aiming for a larger share.  
* **Direct Tone:** No time for pleasantries. The message needs to be clear and emphasize action."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, time is running out for both of us. I'm meeting you in the middle, considering my risk. Let's secure a good outcome now. This is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a more reasonable split, it's still not in my best interest.  Here's why:

* **Inflation Disparity:** The inflation is hitting me significantly harder than Bob. Accepting this offer would mean settling for a much smaller effective amount compared to the initial rounds.
* **Strategic Play:** Bob's message suggests he's feeling the pressure. Continuing to reject his offers might push him to make a more favorable proposal in the next round. 

I need to hold my ground a bit longer to see if I can secure a better deal."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, this is a mirror of your last offer. It's clear we both want this settled.  This is a fair deal considering the time pressure and inflation. Don't let it slip away.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Matching:** Mirroring Bob's previous offer emphasizes the fairness, especially given the increasing inflation impact on my end. 
* **Time Sensitivity:**  The message highlights the shrinking window of opportunity for both of us.
* **Clear Call to Action:**  I'm directly urging Bob to accept to avoid further losses due to inflation."
