71.43,28.57,"Hi Bob, hereâ€™s my proposal: I get $71.43 and you get $28.57 out of the $100. Given that with each future round the money loses more for you (20% per round) than for me (10% per round), delaying only hurts your share more. Accepting now is in both our interests, so I hope you agree to this fair division.",Alice,1,
