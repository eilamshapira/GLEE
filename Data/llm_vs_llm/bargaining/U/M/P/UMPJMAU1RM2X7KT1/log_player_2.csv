"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, hereâ€™s my proposal: I get $71.43 and you get $28.57 out of the $100. Given that with each future round the money loses more for you (20% per round) than for me (10% per round), delaying only hurts your share more. Accepting now is in both our interests, so I hope you agree to this fair division. 
# Bob gain: 28.57 
# Alice gain: 71.43 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
